abstract = {Smart Energy Systems represent a radical shift in the approach to energy generation and demand, driven by decentralisation of the energy system to large numbers of low-capacity devices. Managing this flexibility is often driven by machine learning, and requires real-time control and aggregation of these devices, involving a diverse set of companies and devices and creating a longer chain of trust. This poses a security risk, as it is sensitive to adversarial machine learning, whereby models are fooled through malicious input, either for financial gain or to cause system disruption. We show the feasibility of such an attack by analysing empirical data of a real system, and propose directions for future research related to detection and defence mechanisms for these kind of attacks.},

We then provide an overview of the common practices in evaluation of intrusion detection systems by surveying evaluation approaches and methods related to each part of the design space.

abstract = { The Internet of Things (IoT) and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are fast growing areas. Therefore, several protocols are specifically designed for these domains. CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is one of the more common ones. This lightweight protocol typically communicates over UDP, but can also use TCP and other carrier protocols, and is particularly suitable for embedded systems. In this work, we investigate CoAP with respect to covert communication and explore a new network hiding technique that is based on Artificial Resets. In addition, we investigate another covert channel by using the pattern PT15 Artificial Reconnections. We also propose and discuss detection methods for both covert channels.},

abstract = {Classifiers are often used to detect malicious activities in adversarial environments. Sophisticated adversaries would attempt to find information about deployed classifiers in order to strategise different evasion techniques. It is a widely held belief that randomization of decision boundaries/rules of detection systems would introduce further complexities in attempts made by the adversaries for finding minimal adversarial cost (MAC) evading instances. We have extended the results obtained by Nelson et al. [14] and further presented a novel algorithm that can find optimal evading instances in randomized convex-inducing classifiers using polynomial-many queries. Our results have demonstrated that the complexity introduced through randomization only increases the complexity of finding an optimal evading instance by a constant factor and thus the risk of optimal evasion is still present.},

abstract = {As Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) middleboxes become increasingly popular, a spectrum of adversarial attacks have emerged with the goal of evading such middleboxes. Many of these attacks exploit discrepancies between the middlebox network protocol implementations, and the more rigorous/complete versions implemented at end hosts. These evasion attacks largely involve subtle manipulations of packets to cause different behaviours at DPI and end hosts, to cloak malicious network traffic that is otherwise detectable. With recent automated discovery, it has become prohibitively challenging to manually curate rules for detecting these manipulations. In this work, we propose CLAP, the first fully-automated, unsupervised ML solution to accurately detect and localize DPI evasion attacks. By learning what we call the packet context, which essentially captures inter-relationships across both (1) different packets in a connection; and (2) different header fields within each packet, from benign traffic traces only, CLAP can detect and pinpoint packets that violate the benign packet contexts (which are the ones that are specially crafted for evasion purposes). Our evaluations with 73 state-of-the-art DPI evasion attacks show that CLAP achieves an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUCROC) of <u>0.963</u>, an Equal Error Rate (EER) of only <u>0.061</u> in detection, and an accuracy of <u>94.6%</u> in localization. These results suggest that CLAP can be a promising tool for thwarting DPI evasion attacks.},

Gathering enough realistic data for training machine learning-based defenses is a significant practical challenge. An intelligent red teaming agent capable of performing realistic attacks can alleviate this problem. However, there is little scientific evidence demonstrating the feasibility of fully automated attacks using machine learning. In this work, we exemplify the potential threat of malicious actors using deep reinforcement learning to train automated agents. We present an agent that uses a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm to perform local privilege escalation. Our results show that the autonomous agent can escalate privileges in a Windows~7 environment using a wide variety of different techniques depending on the environment configuration it encounters. Hence, our agent is usable for generating realistic attack sensor data for training and evaluating intrusion detection systems.},

abstract = {Many classification algorithms have been successfully deployed in security-sensitive applications including spam filters and intrusion detection systems. Under such adversarial environments, adversaries can generate exploratory attacks against the defender such as evasion and reverse engineering. In this paper, we discuss why reverse engineering attacks can be carried out quite efficiently against fixed classifiers, and investigate the use of randomization as a suitable strategy for mitigating their risk. In particular, we derive a semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation for learning a distribution of classifiers subject to the constraint that any single classifier picked at random from such distribution provides reliable predictions with a high probability. We analyze the tradeoff between variance of the distribution and its predictive accuracy, and establish that one can almost always incorporate randomization with large variance without incurring a loss in accuracy. In other words, the conventional approach of using a fixed classifier in adversarial environments is generally Pareto suboptimal. Finally, we validate such conclusions on both synthetic and real-world classification problems.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibit excellent performance in machine learning tasks such as image recognition, pattern recognition, speech recognition, and intrusion detection. However, the usage of adversarial examples, which are intentionally corrupted by noise, can lead to misclassification. As adversarial examples are serious threats to DNNs, both adversarial attacks and methods of defending against adversarial examples have been continuously studied. Zero-day adversarial examples are created with new test data and are unknown to the classifier; hence, they represent a more significant threat to DNNs. To the best of our knowledge, there are no analytical studies in the literature of zero-day adversarial examples with a focus on attack and defense methods through experiments using several scenarios. Therefore, in this study, zero-day adversarial examples are practically analyzed with an emphasis on attack and defense methods through experiments using various scenarios composed of a fixed target model and an adaptive target model. The Carlini method was used for a state-of-the-art attack, while an adversarial training method was used as a typical defense method. We used the MNIST dataset and analyzed success rates of zero-day adversarial examples, average distortions, and recognition of original samples through several scenarios of fixed and adaptive target models. Experimental results demonstrate that changing the parameters of the target model in real time leads to resistance to adversarial examples in both the fixed and adaptive target models.},

abstract = {In this technology-based era, network-based systems are facing new cyber-attacks on daily bases. Traditional cybersecurity approaches are based on old threat-knowledge databases and need to be updated on a daily basis to stand against new generation of cyber-threats and protect underlying network-based systems. Along with updating threat-knowledge databases, there is a need for proper management and processing of data generated by sensitive real-time applications. In recent years, various computing platforms based on representation learning algorithms have emerged as a useful resource to manage and exploit the generated data to extract meaningful information. If these platforms are properly utilized, then strong cybersecurity systems can be developed to protect the underlying network-based systems and support sensitive real-time applications. In this survey, we highlight various cyber-threats, real-life examples, and initiatives taken by various international organizations. We discuss various computing platforms based on representation learning algorithms to process and analyze the generated data. We highlight various popular datasets introduced by well-known global organizations that can be used to train the representation learning algorithms to predict and detect threats. We also provide an in-depth analysis of research efforts based on representation learning algorithms made in recent years to protect the underlying network-based systems against current cyber-threats. Finally, we highlight various limitations and challenges in these efforts and available datasets that need to be considered when using them to build cybersecurity systems.},

However, while security researchers often utilize such techniques to address problems and AI/ML researchers develop techniques for Big Data analytics applications, neither community devotes much attention to the other. Within security research, AI/ML components are usually regarded as black-box solvers. Conversely, the learning community seldom considers the security/privacy implications entailed in the application of their algorithms when they are designing them. While these two communities generally focus on different directions, where these two fields do meet, interesting problems appear. Researchers working in this intersection have raised many novel questions for both communities and created a new branch of research known as secure learning.

abstract = {Cybersecurity has rapidly emerged as a grand societal challenge of the 21st century. Innovative solutions to proactively tackle emerging cybersecurity challenges are essential to ensuring a safe and secure society. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a viable approach for sifting through terabytes of heterogeneous cybersecurity data to execute fundamental cybersecurity tasks, such as asset prioritization, control allocation, vulnerability management, and threat detection, with unprecedented efficiency and effectiveness. Despite its initial promise, AI and cybersecurity have been traditionally siloed disciplines that relied on disparate knowledge and methodologies. Consequently, the AI for Cybersecurity discipline is in its nascency. In this article, we aim to provide an important step to progress the AI for Cybersecurity discipline. We first provide an overview of prevailing cybersecurity data, summarize extant AI for Cybersecurity application areas, and identify key limitations in the prevailing landscape. Based on these key issues, we offer a multi-disciplinary AI for Cybersecurity roadmap that centers on major themes such as cybersecurity applications and data, advanced AI methodologies for cybersecurity, and AI-enabled decision making. To help scholars and practitioners make significant headway in tackling these grand AI for Cybersecurity issues, we summarize promising funding mechanisms from the National Science Foundation (NSF) that can support long-term, systematic research programs.

The combination of dimensionality reduction algorithm and clustering algorithm can speed up the distinction between normal log data and abnormal log data, and improve the efficiency. This paper discusses the latest security log analysis methods based on different data mining algorithms at home and abroad, lists the contribution and role of each research method for security analysis, and compares the advantages and disadvantages of the combination of different data mining algorithms for security analysis.

abstract = {Security metrics have received significant attention. However, they have not been systematically explored based on the understanding of attack-defense interactions, which are affected by various factors, including the degree of system vulnerabilities, the power of system defense mechanisms, attack (or threat) severity, and situations a system at risk faces. This survey particularly focuses on how a system security state can evolve as an outcome of cyber attack-defense interactions. This survey concerns how to measure system-level security by proposing a security metrics framework based on the following four sub-metrics: (1) metrics of system vulnerabilities, (2) metrics of defense power, (3) metrics of attack or threat severity, and (4) metrics of situations. To investigate the relationships among these four sub-metrics, we propose a hierarchical ontology with four sub-ontologies corresponding to the four sub-metrics and discuss how they are related to each other. Using the four sub-metrics, we discuss the state-of-art existing security metrics and their advantages and disadvantages (or limitations) to obtain lessons and insight in order to achieve an ideal goal in developing security metrics. Finally, we discuss open research questions in the security metrics research domain and we suggest key factors to enhance security metrics from a system security perspective.},

abstract = {As virtualization technology gains in popularity, so do attempts to compromise the security and integrity of virtualized computing resources. Anti-virus software and firewall programs are typically deployed in the guest virtual machine to detect malicious software. These security measures are effective in detecting known malware, but do little to protect against new variants of intrusions. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) can be used to detect malicious behavior. Most intrusion detection systems for virtual execution environments track behavior at the application or operating system level, using virtualization as a means to isolate themselves from a compromised virtual machine.In this paper, we present a novel approach to intrusion detection of virtual server environments which utilizes only information available from the perspective of the virtual machine monitor (VMM). Such an IDS can harness the ability of the VMM to isolate and manage several virtual machines (VMs), making it possible to provide monitoring of intrusions at a common level across VMs. It also offers unique advantages over recent advances in intrusion detection for virtual machine environments. By working purely at the VMM-level, the IDS does not depend on structures or abstractions visible to the OS (e.g., file systems), which are susceptible to attacks and can be modified by malware to contain corrupted information (e.g., the Windows registry). In addition, being situated within the VMM provides ease of deployment as the IDS is not tied to a specific OS and can be deployed transparently below different operating systems.Due to the semantic gap between the information available to the VMM and the actual application behavior, we employ the power of data mining techniques to extract useful nuggets of knowledge from the raw, low-level architectural data. We show in this paper that by working entirely at the VMM-level, we are able to capture enough information to characterize normal executions and identify the presence of abnormal malicious behavior. Our experiments on over 300 real-world malware and exploits illustrate that there is sufficient information embedded within the VMM-level data to allow accurate detection of malicious attacks, with an acceptable false alarm rate.},

abstract = {The discovery of practical adversarial machine learning (AML) attacks against machine learning-based wired and wireless network security detectors has driven the necessity of a defense. Without a defense mechanism against AML, attacks in wired and wireless networks will go unnoticed by network security classifiers resulting in their ineffectiveness. Therefore, it is essential to motivate a defense against AML attacks for network security classifiers. Existing AML defenses are generally within the context of image recognition. However, these AML defenses have limited transferability to a network security context. Unlike image recognition, a subject matter expert generally derives the features of a network security classifier. Therefore, a network security classifier requires a distinctive strategy for defense. We propose a novel defense-in-depth approach for network security classifiers using a hierarchical ensemble of classifiers, each using a disparate feature set. Subsequently we show the effective use of our hierarchical ensemble to defend an existing network security classifier against an AML attack. Additionally, we discover a novel set of features to detect network scanning activity. Lastly, we propose to enhance our AML defense approach in future work. A shortcoming of our approach is the increased cost to the defender for implementation of each independent classifier. Therefore, we propose combining our AML defense with a moving target defense approach. Additionally, we propose to evaluate our AML defense with a variety of datasets and classifiers and evaluate the effectiveness of decomposing a classifier with many features into multiple classifiers, each with a small subset of the features.},

As a result, anomaly-based NIDSs, built on neural networks, are beginning to receive attention due to their ability to seek out new attacks. However, it has been shown that neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial example attacks in other domains. But, previously proposed anomaly-based NIDSs have not been evaluated in such adversarial settings. In this paper, we show how to evaluate an anomaly-based NIDS trained on network traffic in the face of adversarial inputs. We show how to craft adversarial inputs in the highly constrained network domain, and we evaluate 3 recently proposed NIDSs in an adversarial setting.},

abstract = { Rule learning based intrusion detection systems (IDS) regularly collect and process network traffic, and thereafter they apply rule learning algorithms to the data to identify network communication behaviors represented as IF-THEN rules. Detection rules are inferred offline and can be periodically automatically updated online for intrusion detection. In this context, we implement in the present paper various attacks against MQTT in a carefully designed and very realistic experiment environment, instead of a simulation program as commonly seen in previous works, for data generation. Besides, we investigate a Bayesian rule learning based approach as countermeasure, which is able to detect various attack types. A Bayesian network is learned from training data and subsequently translated into a rule set for intrusion detection. The combination of prior knowledge (about the communication protocol and target system) and data help to efficiently learn the Bayesian network. The translation from the Bayesian network to a set of inherently interpretable rules can be regarded as a transformation from implicit knowledge to explicit knowledge. We show that our proposed method can achieve not only good detection performance but also high interpretability.},

abstract = {The existing state-of-the-art in the field of intrusion detection systems (IDSs) generally involves some use of machine learning algorithms. However, the computer security community is growing increasingly aware that a sophisticated adversary could target the learning module of these IDSs in order to circumvent future detections. Consequently, going forward, robustness of machine-learning based IDSs against adversarial manipulation (i.e., poisoning) will be the key factor for the overall success of these systems in the real world. In our work, we focus on adaptive IDSs that use anomaly-based detection to identify malicious activities in an information system. To be able to evaluate the susceptibility of these IDSs to deliberate adversarial poisoning, we have developed a novel framework for their performance testing under adversarial contamination. We have also studied the viability of using deep autoencoders in the detection of anomalies in adaptive IDSs, as well as their overall robustness against adversarial poisoning. Our experimental results show that our proposed autoencoder-based IDS outperforms a generic PCA-based counterpart by more than 15% in terms of detection accuracy. The obtained results concerning the detection ability of the deep autoencoder IDS under adversarial contamination, compared to that of the PCA-based IDS, are also encouraging, with the deep autoencoder IDS maintaining a more stable detection in parallel to limiting the contamination of its training dataset to just bellow 2%.},

Various methods used by early research tells that, the kind of measures used to detect the intrusion is not specified. Research has grown extensively in Anomaly intrusion detection by using different data mining techniques. Most researchers have not briefed on the kinds of distances measures used, the classification and feature selection techniques used in identifying intrusion detection. Intrusion detection is classified with problems as Outlier problems, Sparseness problem and Data Distribution. One of the important observations made is, High Dimensional Data Reduction is not performed, and conventional dataset is not used or maintained by any researchers. A survey is performed to identify the type of distance measures used and the type of datasets used in the early research. In this extended survey, the measures like Distance measure, pattern behaviors are used in identifying the Network Intrusion Detection. In this paper, we present the various methods used by authors to obtain feature selection methods. Also, the discussion is towards, Computation of High Dimensional Data, how to decide the Choice of Learning algorithm, Efficient Distance and similarity measures to identify the intrusion detection from different datasets.},

However, due to the increasing complexity of CPSs and more sophisticated attacks, conventional anomaly detection methods, which face the growing volume of data and need domain-specific knowledge, cannot be directly applied to address these challenges. To this end, deep learning-based anomaly detection (DLAD) methods have been proposed. In this article, we review state-of-the-art DLAD methods in CPSs. We propose a taxonomy in terms of the type of anomalies, strategies, implementation, and evaluation metrics to understand the essential properties of current methods. Further, we utilize this taxonomy to identify and highlight new characteristics and designs in each CPS domain. Also, we discuss the limitations and open problems of these methods. Moreover, to give users insights into choosing proper DLAD methods in practice, we experimentally explore the characteristics of typical neural models, the workflow of DLAD methods, and the running performance of DL models. Finally, we discuss the deficiencies of DL approaches, our findings, and possible directions to improve DLAD methods and motivate future research.},

However, wearable systems are exposed to massive cyberattacks that threaten not only data security but also human safety and life. One of the fundamental security threats is device impersonation. We therefore propose PHY-IDS; a lightweight real-time detection system that captures spoofing attacks leveraging on body motions. Our system utilizes time series of physical layer features and builds on the fact that it is non-trivial to inject malicious frames that are indistinguishable with legitimate ones. With the help of statistical learning, our system characterizes the signal behavior and flags deviations as anomalies. We experimentally evaluate PHY-IDS's performance using bodyworn devices in real attack scenarios. For four types of attackers with increasing knowledge of the deployed detection system, the results show that PHY-IDS detects naive attackers with high accuracy above 99.8% and maintains good accuracy for stronger attackers at a range from 81.0% to 98.9%.},

Such detectors are often retrained, using data collected during system operation, to cope with the natural evolution (i.e., concept drift) of the monitored signals. However, by exploiting this mechanism, an attacker can fake the signals provided by corrupted sensors at training time and poison the learning process of the detector such that cyber attacks go undetected at test time. With this research, we are the first to demonstrate such poisoning attacks on ICS cyber attack online NN detectors. We propose two distinct attack algorithms, namely, interpolation- and back-gradient based poisoning, and demonstrate their effectiveness on both synthetic and real-world ICS data. We also discuss and analyze some potential mitigation strategies.},

abstract = {With cyber-physical systems opening to the outside world, security can no longer be considered a secondary issue. One of the key aspects in security of cyber-phyiscal systems is to deal with intrusions. In this paper, we highlight the several unique properties of control applications in cyber-physical systems. Using these unique properties, we propose a systematic intrusion-damage assessment and mitigation mechanism for the class of observable and controllable attacks.On the one hand, in cyber-physical systems, the plants follow certain laws of physics and this can be utilized to address the intrusion-damage assessment problem. That is, the states of the controlled plant should follow those expected according to the physics of the system and any major discrepancy is potentially an indication of intrusion. Here, we use a machine learning algorithm to capture the normal behavior of the system according to its dynamics. On the other hand, the control performance strongly depends on the amount of allocated resources and this can be used to address the intrusion-damage mitigation problem. That is, the intrusion-damage mitigation is based on the idea of allocating more resources to the control application under attack. This is done using a feedback-based approach including a convex optimization.},

We identify and demonstrate integrity attacks against document-level sentiment analysis that take into account such practical constraints.

abstract = {Malicious crowdsourcing forums are gaining traction as sources of spreading misinformation online, but are limited by the costs of hiring and managing human workers. In this paper, we identify a new class of attacks that leverage deep learning language models (Recurrent Neural Networks or RNNs) to automate the generation of fake online reviews for products and services. Not only are these attacks cheap and therefore more scalable, but they can control rate of content output to eliminate the signature burstiness that makes crowdsourced campaigns easy to detect.Using Yelp reviews as an example platform, we show how a two phased review generation and customization attack can produce reviews that are indistinguishable by state-of-the-art statistical detectors. We conduct a survey-based user study to show these reviews not only evade human detection, but also score high on "usefulness" metrics by users. Finally, we develop novel automated defenses against these attacks, by leveraging the lossy transformation introduced by the RNN training and generation cycle. We consider countermeasures against our mechanisms, show that they produce unattractive cost-benefit tradeoffs for attackers, and that they can be further curtailed by simple constraints imposed by online service providers.},

abstract = { Machine learning(ML)-based botnet detection methods have become mainstream in corporate practice. However, researchers have found that ML models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can mislead the models by adding subtle perturbations to the sample. Due to the complexity of traffic samples and the special constraints that to keep malicious functions, no substantial research of adversarial ML has been conducted in the botnet detection field, where the evasion attacks caused by carefully crafted adversarial examples may directly make ML-based detectors unavailable and cause significant property damage. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning(RL) method for bypassing ML-based botnet detectors. Specifically, we train an RL agent as a functionality-preserving botnet flow modifier through a series of interactions with the detector in a black-box scenario. This enables the attacker to evade detection without modifying the botnet source code or affecting the botnet utility. Experiments on 14 botnet families prove that our method has considerable evasion performance and time performance.},

abstract = {Substation security plays an important role in the delivery system of electrical energy. During the past years, there has been an increase in the number of attacks on automation systems. In spite of that, there has not been enough focus dedicated to the protection of such networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel machine learning based intrusion detection system targeted at automation networks of substations based on the IEC 60780-5-104 protocol. The novelty of our approach opposed to the state-of-the-art is the monitoring of several features on multiple protocol layers, which enables the identification of multiple types of attacks. Firstly, we simulate the communication between the substation slave and the server based on data gained from real substations and we simulate the systems behaviour under attack, too. Secondly, we observe the system's normal behavior and its behavior under the attack, in order to extract features needed for building an anomaly detection system. Lastly, based on these features we suggest an anomaly detection system for the asynchronous IEC 60870-5-104 protocol. We designed the anomaly detection model by using machine learning from the IEC 60870-5-104 protocol data acquired. The classifier with the highest performance was chosen by comparing 7 different classification algorithms: the Rule Learner classifier algorithm turned out to be the best.},

In each category, we identify security problems, players, and game models. We summarize the main results of selected works, such as equilibrium analysis and security mechanism designs. In addition, we provide a discussion on the advantages, drawbacks, and future direction of using game theory in this field. In this survey, our goal is to instill in the reader an enhanced understanding of different research approaches in applying game-theoretic methods to network security.

abstract = {Despite decades of research in network traffic analysis and incredible advances in artificial intelligence, network intrusion detection systems based on machine learning (ML) have yet to prove their worth. One core obstacle is the existence of concept drift, an issue for all adversary-facing security systems. Additionally, specific challenges set intrusion detection apart from other ML-based security tasks, such as malware detection.In this work, we offer a new perspective on these challenges. We propose INSOMNIA, a semi-supervised intrusion detector which continuously updates the underlying ML model as network traffic characteristics are affected by concept drift. We use active learning to reduce latency in the model updates, label estimation to reduce labeling overhead, and apply explainable AI to better interpret how the model reacts to the shifting distribution.To evaluate INSOMNIA, we extend TESSERACT - a framework originally proposed for performing sound time-aware evaluations of ML-based malware detectors - to the network intrusion domain. Our evaluation shows that accounting for drifting scenarios is vital for effective intrusion detection systems.},

abstract = { Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSes) are being widely deployed in security critical scenarios such as smart homes and medical devices. Unfortunately, the connectedness of these systems and their relative lack of security measures makes them ripe targets for attacks. Specification-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been shown to be effective for securing CPSs. Unfortunately, deriving invariants for capturing the specifications of CPS systems is a tedious and error-prone process. Therefore, it is important to dynamically monitor the CPS system to learn its common behaviors and formulate invariants for detecting security attacks. Existing techniques for invariant mining only incorporate data and events, but not time. However, time is central to most CPS systems, and hence incorporating time in addition to data and events, is essential for achieving low false positives and false negatives. This paper proposes ARTINALI, which mines dynamic system properties by incorporating time as a first-class property of the system. We build ARTINALI-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) for two CPSes, namely smart meters and smart medical devices, and measure their efficacy. We find that the ARTINALI-based IDSes significantly reduce the ratio of false positives and false negatives by 16 to 48% (average 30.75%) and 89 to 95% (average 93.4%) respectively over other dynamic invariant detection tools. },

Several solutions have been proposed in the literature inspired from reputation based systems, outlier detection or model-based fault detection techniques in process control. We have reviewed some of these solutions, and propose two mitigation techniques to protect the consensus-based Network Intrusion Detection System in [1]. We analyze several implementation issues such as computational overhead, fine tuning of the solution parameters, impacts on the convergence of the consensus phase, accuracy of the intrusion detection system.},

abstract = {Modern traffic analysis applications are usually designed to identify malicious behaviors by inferring sensitive information with machine learning (ML) techniques from network traffic, and they are of great importance to security with the growing use of encryption and other evasion techniques that make classic content-based analysis infeasible. However, with the soaring throughput of networks reaching hundreds of Gbps, it becomes more and more challenging for traffic analysis applications to keep up with today's high-speed large-volume network traffic. In particular, existing feature extractor components in traffic analysis are suffering from undesirable communications, storage, and computation bottleneck. To this end, this paper presents FastFE, a high-speed feature extractor that leverages the capability of new-generation programmable switches to generate desired traffic features flexibly and efficiently. We provide a set of general, easy-to-use, and expressive interfaces for operators to express which traic features they desire, and a policy enforcement engine that can effectively translate these policies into underlying primitives in programmable switches and commodity servers. Our case study on a state-of-the-art ML-based traffic analysis application, Kitsune, demonstrates the significant advancement of FastFE and its low overheads. As an ongoing work, we are working on a full prototype design and implementation, and hope FastFE can serve as a crucial build block for future ML-based traffic analysis applications.},

The ultimate goal of DOOM is not to give a potent weapon in the hands of cyber-attackers, but to create defensive-mechanisms against advanced zero-day attacks. Experimental results indicate that the obfuscated malware created by DOOM could effectively mimic multiple-simultaneous zero-day attacks. To the best of our knowledge, DOOM is the first system that could generate obfuscated malware detailed to individual op-code level. DOOM is also the first-ever system to use efficient continuous action control based deep reinforcement learning in the area of malware generation and defense. Experimental results indicate that over 67% of the metamorphic malware generated by DOOM could easily evade detection from even the most potent IDS. This achievement gains significance, as with this, even IDS augment with advanced routing sub-system can be easily evaded by the malware generated by DOOM.},

abstract = {The MITRE Corporation is a non-profit organization that has made substantial efforts into creating and maintaining knowledge bases relevant to cybersecurity and has been widely adopted by the community. ATT&amp;CK ”Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge” is a popular taxonomy by MITRE, which describes threat actor behaviors. Techniques are the foundation of the ATT&amp;CK model, they are the actions that adversaries perform to accomplish goals, which translate into the model’s tactics. The aim of ATT&amp;CK is to categorize adversary behavior to help improve the post-compromise detection of advanced intrusions. Software vulnerabilities (CVE) play an important role in cyber-intrusions, mostly classified into 4 ATT&amp;CK techniques, which cover the exploitation phase of the attack chain. Identifying vulnerabilities that are actively exploited by the attackers, and understanding how a vulnerability can enable the attacker at each stage of the attack life cycle is absolutely critical for vulnerability assessments. Given the sparse classification of a CVE into ATT&amp;CK taxonomy, lack of methods to extract labels from threat reports and, the volume of vulnerabilities disclosed defenders lack a concrete approach to prioritize CVE’s based on their role in the attack chain and in the context of controls in place. In this work, we propose a Multi-Head Joint Embedding Neural Network model to automatically map CVE’s to ATT&amp;CK techniques. We address the problem of lack of labels for this task, by a novel unsupervised labeling technique. We enrich CVE’s with a curated knowledgebase 50 mitigation strategies, which help the model to learn both attacker and defender view of a given CVE. We evaluate our approach with the dataset containing CVE’s disclosed from the past 10 years and compare it with standard baseline models and ablation analysis. Using the proposed model, we mapped 62,000 CVE records to 37 different ATT&amp;CK techniques and show that the proposed multi head design performs well in the absence of labels in the training dataset. },

In this open problem paper, we motivate the necessity of active learning in the security domain, identify problems caused by the application of present active learning techniques in adversarial settings, and propose a framework for experimentation and implementation of active learning systems in adversarial contexts. More than other contexts, adversarial contexts particularly need active learning as ongoing attempts to evade and confuse classifiers necessitate constant generation of labels for new content to keep pace with adversarial activity. Just as traditional machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, we discuss assumptions specific to active learning that introduce additional vulnerabilities, as well as present vulnerabilities that are amplified in the active learning setting. Lastly, we present a software architecture, Security-oriented Active Learning Testbed (SALT), for the research and implementation of active learning applications in adversarial contexts.},

abstract = {We propose a novel behavioral malware detection approach based on a generic system-wide quantitative data flow model. We base our data flow analysis on the incremental construction of aggregated quantitative data flow graphs. These graphs represent communication between different system entities such as processes, sockets, files or system registries. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through a prototypical instantiation and implementation for the Windows operating system. Our experiments yield encouraging results: in our data set of samples from common malware families and popular non-malicious applications, our approach has a detection rate of 96% and a false positive rate of less than 1.6%. In comparison with closely related data flow based approaches, we achieve similar detection effectiveness with considerably better performance: an average full system analysis takes less than one second.},

abstract = {Web shells are malicious scripts that attackers upload to a compromised web server in order to remotely execute arbitrary commands, maintain their access, and elevate their privileges. Despite their high prevalence in practice and heavy involvement in security breaches, web shells have never been the direct subject of any study. In contrast, web shells have been treated as malicious blackboxes that need to be detected and removed, rather than malicious pieces of software that need to be analyzed and, in detail, understood. In this paper, we report on the first comprehensive study of web shells. By utilizing different static and dynamic analysis methods, we discover and quantify the visible and invisible features offered by popular malicious shells, and we discuss how attackers can take advantage of these features. For visible features, we find the presence of password bruteforcers, SQL database clients, portscanners, and checks for the presence of security software installed on the compromised server. In terms of invisible features, we find that about half of the analyzed shells contain an authentication mechanism, but this mechanism can be bypassed in a third of the cases. Furthermore, we find that about a third of the analyzed shells perform homephoning, i.e., the shells, upon execution, surreptitiously communicate to various third parties with the intent of revealing the location of new shell installations. By setting up honeypots, we quantify the number of third-party attackers benefiting from shell installations and show how an attacker, by merely registering the appropriate domains, can completely take over all installations of specific vulnerable shells.},

abstract = {Cyberattacks on both databases and critical infrastructure have threatened public and private sectors. Ubiquitous tracking and wearable computing have infringed upon privacy. Advocates and engineers have recently proposed using defensive deception as a means to leverage the information asymmetry typically enjoyed by attackers as a tool for defenders. The term deception, however, has been employed broadly and with a variety of meanings. In this article, we survey 24 articles from 2008 to 2018 that use game theory to model defensive deception for cybersecurity and privacy. Then, we propose a taxonomy that defines six types of deception: perturbation, moving target defense, obfuscation, mixing, honey-x, and attacker engagement. These types are delineated by their information structures, agents, actions, and duration: precisely concepts captured by game theory. Our aims are to rigorously define types of defensive deception, to capture a snapshot of the state of the literature, to provide a menu of models that can be used for applied research, and to identify promising areas for future work. Our taxonomy provides a systematic foundation for understanding different types of defensive deception commonly encountered in cybersecurity and privacy.},

abstract = {In recent years, the amount and the sophistication of cyber attacks has increased significantly. This creates a plethora of challenges from a security perspective. First, for the efficient monitoring of a network, the generated alerts need to be presented and summarized in a meaningful manner. Second, additional analytics are required to identify sophisticated and correlated attacks. In particular, the detection of correlated attacks requires collaboration between different monitoring points. Cyber incident monitors are platforms utilized for supporting the tasks of network administrators and provide an initial step towards coping with the aforementioned challenges.In this paper, we present our cyber incident monitor TraCINg. TraCINg obtains alert data from honeypot sensors distributed across all over the world. The main contribution of this paper is a thoughtful discussion of the lessons learned, both from a design rational perspective as well as from the analysis of data gathered during a five month deployment period. Furthermore, we show that even with a relatively small number of deployed sensors, it is possible to detect correlated attacks that target multiple sensors.},

abstract = {Edge networks connected to the Internet need effective monitoring techniques to inform routing decisions and detect violations of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). However, existing measurement tools, like ping, traceroute, and trajectory sampling, are vulnerable to attacks that can make a path look better than it really is. Here, we design and analyze a lightweight path-quality monitoring protocol that reliably raises an alarm when the packet-loss rate exceed a threshold, even when an adversary tries to bias monitoring results by selectively delaying, dropping, modifying, injecting, or preferentially treating packets. Our protocol is based on sublinear algorithms for sketching the second moment of stream of items and can monitor billions of packets using only 250--600 B of storage and the periodic transmission of a comparably sized IP packet. We also show how this protocol can be used to construct a more sophisticated protocol that allows the sender to localize the link responsible for the dropped packets. We prove that our protocols satisfy a precise definition of security, analyze their performance using numerical experiments, and derive analytic expressions for the tradeoff between statistical accuracy and system overhead. This paper contains a deeper treatment of results from earlier conference papers and several new results.},

abstract = {In recent years, cyberspace has been formed and is continuously developing. It has fundamentally revolutionized the mechanism by which information is disseminated and utilized, in order to be closely involved in the physical world and human activities. However, from global perspective, factors such as the continuously increasing complexity of structure and function of cyberspace, the rising benefits from both economic and political aspects, the exposing of inherent vulnerabilities have all contributed to even severe security threats and risks targeting cyberspace, which have become a key factor in national security in the challenging situations. Strategic cyberspace risks are different kinds of core, structural and systematic risk that if were neglected to prevent and control, significant damage to cyberspace will be dealt and cause great economic loss. Aiming at exploring new ways and tackling with such strategic threats, the concept, elements and relationship between tactical and strategic risk in cyberspace was studied. A knowledge-based cyberspace strategic risk warning and assessment system with four data-driven layers was built, and two scenarios of heartbleed and Teamviewer vulnerability event are investigated to suggest possible use cases for our system.},

abstract = {The analysts at a cybersecurity operations center (CSOC) analyze the alerts that are generated by intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Under normal operating conditions, sufficient numbers of analysts are available to analyze the alert workload. For the purpose of this article, this means that the cybersecurity analysts in each shift can fully investigate each and every alert that is generated by the IDSs in a reasonable amount of time and perform their normal tasks in a shift. Normal tasks include analysis time, time to attend training programs, report writing time, personal break time, and time to update the signatures on new patterns in alerts as detected by the IDS. There are several disruptive factors that occur randomly and can adversely impact the normal operating condition of a CSOC, such as (1) higher alert generation rates from a few IDSs, (2) new alert patterns that decrease the throughput of the alert analysis process, and (3) analyst absenteeism. The impact of the preceding factors is that the alerts wait for a long duration before being analyzed, which impacts the level of operational effectiveness (LOE) of the CSOC. To return the CSOC to normal operating conditions, the manager of a CSOC can take several actions, such as increasing the alert analysis time spent by analysts in a shift by canceling a training program, spending some of his own time to assist the analysts in alert investigation, and calling upon the on-call analyst workforce to boost the service rate of alerts. However, additional resources are limited in quantity over a 14-day work cycle, and the CSOC manager must determine when and how much action to take in the face of uncertainty, which arises from both the intensity and the random occurrences of the disruptive factors. The preceding decision by the CSOC manager is nontrivial and is often made in an ad hoc manner using prior experiences. This work develops a reinforcement learning (RL) model for optimizing the LOE throughout the entire 14-day work cycle of a CSOC in the face of uncertainties due to disruptive events. Results indicate that the RL model is able to assist the CSOC manager with a decision support tool to make better decisions than current practices in determining when and how much resource to allocate when the LOE of a CSOC deviates from the normal operating condition.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel (unsupervised) anomaly detection framework which can be used to detect anomalies in a streaming fashion by making only one pass over the data while utilizing limited storage. We adapt ideas from matrix sketching to maintain, in a streaming model, a set of few orthogonal vectors that form a good approximate basis for all the observed data. Using this constructed orthogonal basis, anomalies in new incoming data are detected based on a simple reconstruction error test. We theoretically prove that our algorithm compares favorably with an offline approach based on expensive global singular value decomposition (SVD) updates. Additionally, we apply ideas from randomized low-rank matrix approximations to further speedup the algorithm. The experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach over other popular scalable anomaly detection approaches.},

abstract = { Mobile malware is growing in number and its complexity is constantly increasing. Malware authors are continuously looking new ways to elude anti-malware controls. Anti-malware are not able to detect zero-day malware, because to detect malicious behaviour they need to know its signature, but to have this information the malware must already be widespread. Furthermore, anti-malware are able to scan one application at a time: for this reason a type of malware characterized by the colluding attack, where the malicious action is split in two (or more) applications, can not be recognised. To demonstrate the ineffectiveness of current anti-malware mechanisms in recognizing colluding attacks, in this paper we propose Ste\ae{}lErgon, a framework aimed to inject a malicious payload in two or more different Android applications. Clearly the malicious payload will be executed once all the applications composing the collusive attacks are installed into the infected device. In detail, Ste\ae{}lErgon is able to inject a collusive malicious payload attacking the external storage, allowing the attacker to catch sensitive and private information stored into the infected device. We perform an experimental analysis by submitting the generated colluding application to different 79 anti-malware, by showing that current detection mechanism are not able to detect this kind of threat. To boost research in focusing the attention in colluding attacks we freely release Ste\ae{}lErgon, is available for research purposes at the following url: https://github.com/vigimella/StealErgon.},

abstract = { Cyberattacks targeting modern network infrastructures are increasing in number and impact. This growing phenomenon emphasizes the central role of cybersecurity and, in particular, the reaction against ongoing threats targeting assets within the protected system. Such centrality is reflected in the literature, where several works have been presented to propose full-fledged reaction methodologies to tackle offensive incidents’ consequences. In this direction, the work in&nbsp;[18] developed an immuno-based response approach based on the application of the Artificial Immune System (AIS) methodology. That is, the AIS-powered reaction is able to calculate the optimal set of atomic countermeasure to enforce on the asset within the monitored system, minimizing the risk to which those are exposed in a more than adequate time. To further contribute to this line, the paper at hand presents AISGA, a multi-objective approach that leverages the capabilities of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the selection of the input parameters of the AIS methodology. Specifically, AISGA selects the optimal ranges of inputs that balance the tradeoff between minimizing the global risk and the execution time of the methodology. Additionally, by flooding the AIS-powered reaction with a wide range of possible inputs, AISGA intends to demonstrate the robustness of such a model. Exhaustive experiments are executed to precisely compute the optimal ranges of parameters, demonstrating that the proposed multi-objective optimization prefers a fast-but-effective reaction.},

A very popular and well-known such approach is the use of unsolicited electronic messages, also known as spam. Such messages can be used by attackers in order to tempt the recipient to visit a malicious page, or to reply to a message and be charged at premium rates, or even for advertising goods and offers. Several of the mechanisms developed for fighting mobile spam have been based on the well-known and widely adopted e-mail spam techniques. Mobile spam on the other hand has specific properties, such as limited text size, particular linguistic style with specific abbreviations, also known as "the SMS language" or "textese", etc. Our algorithm, FIMESS (FIltering Mobile External SMS Spam), performs simple, yet effective checks on the message headers so as to classify an SMS as being spam or not. In contrast to linguistic-only approaches of spam detection algorithms, FIMESS is able to utilise the important information in the SMS headers and identify SMS spam messages. Contrary to the email metadata which can easily be manipulated by the spammers, the SMS protocol provides useful information to build more efficient spam filters. The proposed scheme was tested on the Android platform and yielded encouraging results.},

abstract = {We consider Delay Tolerant Mobile Social Networks (DTMSNs), made of wireless nodes with intermittent connections and clustered into social communities. The lack of infrastructure and its reliance on nodes' mobility make routing a challenge. Network Coding (NC) is a generalization of routing and has been shown to bring a number of advantages over routing. We consider the problem of pollution attacks in these networks, that are a very important issue both for NC and for DTMSNs. Our first contribution is to propose a protocol which allows controlling adversary's capacity by combining cryptographic hash dissemination and error-correction to ensure message recovery at the receiver. Our second contribution is the modeling of the performance of such a protection scheme. To do so, we adapt an inter-session NC model based on a fluid approximation of the dissemination process. We provide a numerical validation of the model. We are eventually able to provide a workflow to set the correct parameters and counteract the attacks. We conclude by highlighting how these contributions can help secure a real-world DTMSN application (e.g., a smart-phone app.).},

abstract = {The introduction of modern Smart Home Systems (SHSs) is redefining the way we perform everyday activities. Today, myriad SHS applications and the devices they control are widely available to users. Specifically, users can easily download and install the apps from vendor-specific app markets, or develop their own, to effectively implement their SHS solutions. However, despite their benefits, app-based SHSs unfold diverse security risks. Several attacks have already been reported to SHSs and current security solutions only consider smart home devices and apps individually to detect malicious actions, rather than the context of the SHS as a whole. Thus, the current security solutions applied to SHSs cannot capture user activities and sensor-device-user interactions in a holistic fashion. To address these limitations, in this article, we introduce Aegis+, a novel context-aware platform-independent security framework to detect malicious behavior in an SHS. Specifically, Aegis+ observes the states of the connected smart home entities (sensors and devices) for different user activities and usage patterns in an SHS and builds a contextual model to differentiate between malicious and benign behavior. We evaluated the efficacy and performance of Aegis+ in multiple smart home settings (i.e., single bedroom, double bedroom, duplex) and platforms (i.e., Samsung SmartThings, Amazon Alexa) where real users perform day-to-day activities using real SHS devices. We also measured the performance of Aegis+ against five different malicious behaviors. Our detailed evaluation shows that Aegis+ can detect malicious behavior in SHS with high accuracy (over 95%) and secure the SHS regardless of the smart home layout and platforms, device configurations, installed apps, controller devices, and enforced user policies. Finally, Aegis+ yields minimum overhead to the SHS, ensuring effective deployability in real-life smart environments.},

abstract = {The moving network target defense (MTD) based approach to security aims to design and develop capabilities to dynamically change the attack surfaces to make it more difficult for attackers to strike. One such capability is to dynamically change the IP addresses of subnetworks in unpredictable ways in an attempt to disrupt the ability of an attacker to collect the necessary reconnaissance information to launch successful attacks. In particular, Denial of Service (DoS) and worms represent examples of distributed attacks that can potentially propagate through networks very quickly, but could also be disrupted by MTD. Conversely, MTD are also disruptive to regular users. For example, when IP addresses are changed dynamically it is no longer effective to use DNS caches for IP address resolutions before any communication can be performed. In this work we take another approach. We note that the deployment of MTD could be triggered through the use of light-weight intrusion detection. We demonstrate that the neuro-evolution of augmented topologies algorithm (NEAT) has the capacity to construct detectors that operate on packet data and produce sparse topologies, hence are real-time in operation. Benchmarking under examples of DoS and worm attacks indicates that NEAT detectors can be constructed from relatively small amounts of data and detect attacks approx. 90% accuracy. Additional experiments with the open-ended evolution of code modules through genetic program teams provided detection rates approaching 100%. We believe that adopting such an approach to MTB a more specific deployment strategy that is less invasive to legitimate users, while disrupting the actions of malicious users.},

One class of cyber-attack is advanced persistent threats where highly skilled attackers can steal user authentication information and then move laterally in the network, from host to host in a hidden manner until they reach an attractive target. The security modeling process of CPSs is divided into two phases of intrusion and disruption. In each phase, a game-theoretic paradigm with different parameters predicts the interactions between the attacker and the system. By solving the model, the security of CPSs is estimated in terms of probability of attack and probability of defend. After getting those the attackers and defenders can take optimized actions to maximize their gains. Most importantly, defender/systems can tune the system parameters to mitigate the attack.},

abstract = {Password reuse has been long understood as a problem: credentials stolen from one site may be leveraged to gain access to another site for which they share a password. Indeed, it is broadly understood that attackers exploit this fact and routinely leverage credentials extracted from a site they have breached to access high-value accounts at other sites (e.g., email accounts). However, as a consequence of such acts, this same phenomena of password reuse attacks can be harnessed to indirectly infer site compromises---even those that would otherwise be unknown. In this paper we describe such a measurement technique, in which unique honey accounts are registered with individual third-party websites, and thus access to an email account provides indirect evidence of credentials theft at the corresponding website. We describe a prototype system, called Tripwire, that implements this technique using an automated Web account registration system combined with email account access data from a major email provider. In a pilot study monitoring more than 2,300 sites over a year, we have detected 19 site compromises, including what appears to be a plaintext password compromise at an Alexa top-500 site with more than 45 million active users.},

However, existing studies were often conducted under a less adversarial setting, in that they ignore the possibility that an alert attacker can also try to detect the activation of MTD and then cancel any FDI attack until they learn the new system configuration after MTD. Indeed, in this paper, we show that this can be achieved easily by the attacker. To improve the stealthiness of MTD against the attacker, we propose a hidden MTD approach that maintains the power flows of the whole grid after MTD. We develop an algorithm to construct the hidden MTD and analyze its feasibility condition when only a subset of transmission lines can adjust susceptance. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the hidden MTD against alert attackers under realistic settings.},

Although the division of the control and data planes on networks has lead to dynamic reconfigurability of large networks, finding the minimal and optimal set of controllers that can adapt to the changes in the network has proven to be a challenging problem. Recent research tends to favor small solution sets with a focus on either propagation latency or controller load distribution, and struggles to find large balanced solution sets. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective genetic algorithm based approach to the controller placement problem that minimizes inter-controller latency, load distribution and the number of controllers with fitness sharing. We demonstrate that the proposed approach provides diverse and adaptive solutions to real network architectures such as the United States backbone and Japanese backbone networks.

abstract = {Compromised smart meters sending false power consumption data in Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) may have drastic consequences on the smart grid»s operation. Most existing defense models only deal with electricity theft from individual customers (isolated attacks) using supervised classification techniques that do not offer scalable or real time solutions. Furthermore, the cyber and interconnected nature of AMIs can also be exploited by organized adversaries who have the ability to orchestrate simultaneous data falsification attacks after compromising several meters, and also have more complex goals than just electricity theft. In this paper, we first propose a real time semi-supervised anomaly based consensus correction technique that detects the presence and type of smart meter data falsification, and then performs a consensus correction accordingly. Subsequently, we propose a semi-supervised consensus based trust scoring model, that is able to identify the smart meters injecting false data. The main contribution of the proposed approach is to provide a practical framework for compromised smart meter identification that (i) is not supervised (ii) enables quick identification (iii) scales classification error rates better for larger sized AMIs; (iv) counters threats from both isolated and orchestrated attacks; and (v) simultaneously works for a variety of data falsification types. Extensive experimental validation using two real datasets from USA and Ireland, demonstrates the ability of our proposed method to identify compromised meters in near real time across different datasets.},

abstract = {Wide Area Monitoring Systems (WAMSs) provide an essential building block for Smart Grid supervision and control. Distributed Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) allow accurate clock-synchronized measurements of voltage and current phasors (amplitudes, phase angles) and frequencies. The sensor data from PMUs provide situational awareness in the grid, and are used as input for control decisions. A modification of sensor data can severely impact grid stability, overall power supply, and physical devices. Since power grids are critical infrastructures, WAMSs are tempting targets for all kinds of attackers, including well-organized and motivated adversaries such as terrorist groups or adversarial nation states. Such groups possess sufficient resources to launch sophisticated attacks.In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of attack possibilities on WAMSs. We model the dependencies and building blocks of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) on WAMSs using attack trees. We consider the whole WAMS infrastructure, including aggregation and data collection points, such as Phasor Data Concentrators (PDCs), classical IT components, and clock synchronization. Since Smart Grids are cyber-physical systems, we consider physical perturbations, in addition to cyber attacks in our models. The models provide valuable information about the chain of cyber or physical attack steps that can be combined to build a sophisticated attack for reaching a higher goal. They assist in the assessment of physical and cyber vulnerabilities, and provide strategic guidance for the deployment of suitable countermeasures.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) play a significant role in our critical infrastructure networks from power-distribution to utility networks. The emerging smart-grid concept is a compelling critical CPS infrastructure that relies on two-way communications between smart devices to increase efficiency, enhance reliability, and reduce costs. However, compromised devices in the smart grid poses several security challenges. Consequences of propagating fake data or stealing sensitive smart grid information via compromised devices are costly. Hence, early behavioral detection of compromised devices is critical for protecting the smart grid’s components and data. To address these concerns, in this article, we introduce a novel and configurable system-level framework to identify compromised smart grid devices. The framework combines system and function call tracing techniques with signal processing and statistical analysis to detect compromised devices based on their behavioral characteristics. We measure the efficacy of our framework with a realistic smart grid substation testbed that includes both resource-limited and resource-rich devices. In total, using our framework, we analyze six different types of compromised device scenarios with different resources and attack payloads. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed framework is the first in detecting compromised CPS smart grid devices with system and function-level call tracing techniques. The experimental results reveal an excellent rate for the detection of compromised devices. Specifically, performance metrics include accuracy values between 95% and 99% for the different attack scenarios. Finally, the performance analysis demonstrates that the use of the proposed framework has minimal overhead on the smart grid devices’ computing resources.},

abstract = {Malware is a serious threat to network-connected embedded systems, as evidenced by the continued and rapid growth of such devices, commonly referred to as the Internet of Things. Their ubiquitous use in critical applications require robust protection to ensure user safety and privacy. That protection must be applied to all system aspects, extending beyond protecting the network and external interfaces. Anomaly detection is one of the last lines of defence against malware, in which data-driven approaches that require the least domain knowledge are popular. However, embedded systems, particularly edge devices, face several challenges in applying data-driven anomaly detection, including unpredictability of malware, limited tolerance to long data collection windows, and limited computing/energy resources. In this article, we utilize subcomponent timing information of software execution, including intrinsic software execution, instruction cache misses, and data cache misses as features, to detect anomalies based on ranges, multi-dimensional Euclidean distance, and classification at runtime. Detection methods based on lumped timing range are also evaluated and compared. We design several hardware detectors implementing these data-driven detection methods, which non-intrusively measuring lumped/subcomponent timing of all system/function calls of the embedded application. We evaluate the area, power, and detection latency of the presented detector designs. Experimental results demonstrate that the subcomponent timing model provides sufficient features to achieve high detection accuracy with low false-positive rates using a one-class support vector machine, considering sophisticated mimicry malware.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel integrated platform for the automatic detection and mitigation of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks in networked systems. Recently, these attacks have evolved from simple flooding at the network layer to targeted, application-specific asymmetric attacks. Because of this trend, existing techniques---which rely primarily on network classification at the edge or core routing devices---are becoming ineffective. Our platform integrates machine learning with fine-grained application-level performance metrics and monitoring statistics at the software's components to achieve precise traffic classification for detecting application-specific attacks in real time. When an attack is detected, the platform will then automatically isolate suspicious traffic by routing it to separate component instances with a fixed resource reservation, thus preventing it from interfering with the rest of the system. Our evaluation using a range of asymmetric attacks shows that our detection technique is highly effective and that the close-loop integration of real-time detection and traffic isolation can deliver substantially better quality-of-service for good users in the presence of attacks than the default mitigation using dynamic scaling of resource alone.},

abstract = {The crucial aim of software security is malware detection. A malware is a program with malicious intents. The predominate anti-malware solutions are signature-based. These detectors compute the signature starting from the syntactic characteristics of the malicious code. Unfortunately, the signature-based techniques are ineffective against the code obfuscations, i.e., trivial transformations that alter the syntax of the code preserving the normal behaviour of the program. To address this limitation, formal methods are used in software security. Formal methods are rigorous techniques used to verify the behaviour of a system. This paper aims to make an overview on behavioural based techniques developed to detect malware programs. The illustrated approaches are based on different formal techniques.},

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are deployed in more and more classification systems, but adversarial samples can be maliciously crafted to trick them, and are becoming a real threat. There have been various proposals to improve CNNs' adversarial robustness but these all suffer performance penalties or have other limitations. In this paper, we offer a new approach in the form of a certifiable adversarial detection scheme, the Certifiable Taboo Trap (CTT). This system, in theory, can provide certifiable guarantees of detectability of a range of adversarial inputs for certain l-∞ sizes. We develop and evaluate several versions of CTT with different defense capabilities, training overheads and certifiability on adversarial samples. In practice, against adversaries with various l-p norms, CTT outperforms existing defense methods that focus purely on improving network robustness. We show that CTT has small false positive rates on clean test data, minimal compute overheads when deployed, and can support complex security policies.},

abstract = {Organizations, such as companies and governments, created Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to defend against computer security attacks. SOCs are central defense groups that focus on security incident management with capabilities such as monitoring, preventing, responding, and reporting. They are one of the most critical defense components of a modern organization's defense. Despite their critical importance to organizations, and the high frequency of reported security incidents, only a few research studies focus on problems specific to SOCs. In this study, to understand and identify the issues of SOCs, we conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with SOC analysts and managers who work for organizations from different industry sectors. Through our analysis of the interview data, we identified technical and non-technical issues that exist in SOC. Moreover, we found inherent disagreements between SOC managers and their analysts that, if not addressed, could entail a risk to SOC efficiency and effectiveness. We distill these issues into takeaways that apply both to future academic research and to SOC management. We believe that research should focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of SOCs.},

abstract = {Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging networking paradigm that provides unprecedented flexibility in dynamically reconfiguring an IP network. It enables various applications such as network management, quality of service (QoS) optimization, and system resilience enhancement. Pilot studies have investigated the possibilities of applying SDN on smart grid communications, while the specific benefits and risks that SDN may bring to the resilience of smart grids against accidental failures and malicious attacks remain largely unexplored. Without a systematic understanding of these issues and convincing validations of proposed solutions, the power industry will be unlikely to embrace SDN, since resilience is always a key consideration for critical infrastructures like power grids. In this position paper, we aim to provide an initial understanding of these issues, by investigating (1) how SDN can enhance the resilience of typical smart grids to malicious attacks, (2) additional risks introduced by SDN and how to manage them, and (3) how to validate and evaluate SDN-based resilience solutions. Our goal is also to trigger more profound discussions on applying SDN to smart grids and inspire innovative SDN-based solutions for enhancing smart grid resilience.},

abstract = { The voice user interface (VUI) has been progressively used to authenticate users to numerous devices and applications. Such massive adoption of VUIs in IoT environments like individual homes and businesses arises extensive privacy and security concerns. Latest VUIs adopting traditional voice authentication methods are vulnerable to spoofing attacks, where a malicious party spoofs the VUIs with pre-recorded or synthesized voice commands of the genuine user. In this paper, we design VibLive, a continuous liveness detection system for secure VUIs in IoT environments. The underlying principle of VibLive is to catch the dissimilarities between bone-conducted vibrations and air-conducted voices when human speaks for liveness detection. VibLive is a text-independent system that verifies live users and detects spoofing attacks without requiring users to enroll specific passphrases. Moreover, VibLive is practical and transparent as it requires neither additional operations nor extra hardwares, other than a loudspeaker and a microphone that are commonly equipped on VUIs. Our evaluation with 25 participants under different IoT intended experiment settings shows that VibLive is highly effective with over 97% detection accuracy. Results also show that VibLive is robust to various use scenarios.},

abstract = { Synthesizing tabular data is attracting much attention these days for various purposes. With sophisticate synthetic data, for instance, one can augment its training data. For the past couple of years, tabular data synthesis techniques have been greatly improved. Recent work made progress to address many problems in synthesizing tabular data, such as the imbalanced distribution and multimodality problems. However, the data utility of state-of-the-art methods is not satisfactory yet. In this work, we significantly improve the utility by designing our generator and discriminator based on neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs). After showing that NODEs have theoretically preferred characteristics for generating tabular data, we introduce our designs. The NODE-based discriminator performs a hidden vector evolution trajectory-based classification rather than classifying with a hidden vector at the last layer only. Our generator also adopts an ODE layer at the very beginning of its architecture to transform its initial input vector (i.e., the concatenation of a noisy vector and a condition vector in our case) onto another latent vector space suitable for the generation process. We conduct experiments with 13 datasets, including but not limited to insurance fraud detection, online news article prediction, and so on, and our presented method outperforms other state-of-the-art tabular data synthesis methods in many cases of our classification, regression, and clustering experiments.},

abstract = {Traffic classification is a fundamental component in advanced network management and security. Recent research has achieved certain success in the application of machine learning techniques into flow statistical feature based approach. However, most of flow statistical feature based methods classify traffic based on the assumption that all traffic flows are generated by the known applications. Considering the pervasive unknown applications in the real world environment, this assumption does not hold. In this paper, we cast unknown applications as a specific classification problem with insufficient negative training data and address it by proposing a binary classifier based framework. An iterative method is proposed to extract unknown information from a set of unlabelled traffic flows, which combines asymmetric bagging and flow correlation to guarantee the purity of extracted negatives. A binary classifier is used as an application signature which can operate on a bag of correlated flows instead of individual flows to further improve its effectiveness. We carry out a series of experiments in a real-world network traffic dataset to evaluate the proposed methods. The results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the-state-of-art traffic classification methods under the situation of unknown applications present.},

Toward such a goal and with the increased number of cyberattacks, the security of these systems needs special attention from the research community. To gauge the extent to which research has been done in this area, we discuss the cybersecurity of these systems. It is essential to model the system from a security perspective, identify the threats and vulnerabilities, and then model the attacks. A survey in this direction explores the theoretical/analytical system and attack models that have been proposed over the years and identifies the research gap that needs to be addressed by the research community.},

abstract = {Modern cloud computing infrastructures use virtual machine monitors (VMMs) that often include a large and complex administrative domain with privileges to inspect client VM state. Attacks against or misuse of the administrative domain can compromise client security and privacy. Moreover, these VMMs provide clients inflexible control over their own VMs, as a result of which clients have to rely on the cloud provider to deploy useful services, such as VM introspection-based security tools.We introduce a new self-service cloud (SSC) computing model that addresses these two shortcomings. SSC splits administrative privileges between a system-wide domain and per-client administrative domains. Each client can manage and perform privileged system tasks on its own VMs, thereby providing flexibility. The system-wide administrative domain cannot inspect the code, data or computation of client VMs, thereby ensuring security and privacy. SSC also allows providers and clients to establish mutually trusted services that can check regulatory compliance while respecting client privacy. We have implemented SSC by modifying the Xen hypervisor. We demonstrate its utility by building user domains to perform privileged tasks such as memory introspection, storage intrusion detection, and anomaly detection.},

abstract = {In this paper we advocate the use of workflow---describing how a system provides its intended functionality---as a pillar of cybersecurity analysis and propose a holistic workflow-oriented assessment framework. While workflow models are currently used in the area of performance and reliability assessment, these approaches are designed neither to assess a system in the presence of an active attacker, nor to assess security aspects such as confidentiality. On the other hand, existing security assessment methods typically focus on modeling the active attacker (e.g., attack graphs), but many rely on restrictive models that are not readily applicable to complex (e.g., cyber-physical or cyber-human) systems.By "going with the flow," our assessment framework can naturally adopt a holistic view of such systems, unifying information about system components, their properties, and possible attacks to argue about a security goal. The argument is expressed in a graph structure, based on inputs from several distinct classes that are integrated in a systematic manner. That rigorous structure allows our approach to provide quantitative assessment in an automated fashion (like reliability assessment tools and attack graphs), while maintaining a broad assessment scope. We demonstrate our security assessment process using the case of Advanced Metering Infrastructure in a smart power grid and obtain quantitative results for system availability and confidentiality.},

It has become an important task to manage to spread alerts on a wireless network at the same time as to hide the nature of these signals, in a secure and efficient way. No one (an adversarial observer or even the node transmitting the signal) should be able to learn whether a signal corresponds to an alert or a normal echo. Blind Coupon Mechanism is a primitive proposed at Asiacrypt 2005 that allows to spread such alerts quietly and quickly. In this paper, we propose to strengthen their security model and we give a concrete solution which is both more secure and more efficient than the protocol originally proposed.},

abstract = {Traditional online learning for graph node classification adapts graph regularization into ridge regression, which may not be suitable when data is adversarially generated. To solve this issue, we propose a more general min-max optimization framework for online graph node classification. The derived online algorithm can achieve a min-max regret compared with the optimal linear model found offline. However, this algorithm assumes that the label is provided for every node, while label is scare and labeling is usually either too time-consuming or expensive in real-world applications. To save labeling effort, we propose a novel confidence-based query approach to prioritize the informative labels. Our theoretical result shows that an online algorithm learning on these selected labels can achieve comparable mistake bound with the fully-supervised online counterpart. To take full advantage of these labels, we propose an aggressive algorithm, which can update the model even if no error occurs. Theoretical analysis shows that the mistake bound of the proposed method, thanks to the aggressive update trials, is better than conservative competitor in expectation. We finally empirically evaluate it on several real-world graph databases. Encouraging experimental results further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

We review their key intuitions, objective functions, underlying assumptions, advantages, and disadvantages and discuss how they address the aforementioned challenges. We further discuss a set of possible future opportunities and new perspectives on addressing the challenges.},

abstract = {As a recent innovation, network functions virtualization (NFV)—with its core concept of replacing hardware middleboxes with software network functions (NFs) implemented in commodity servers—promises cost savings and flexibility benefits. However, transitioning NFs from special-purpose hardware to commodity servers has turned out to be more challenging than expected, as it inevitably incurs performance penalties due to bottlenecks in both software and hardware. To achieve performance comparable to hardware middleboxes, there is a strong demand for a speedup in NF processing, which plays a crucial role in the success of NFV. In this article, we study the performance challenges that exist in general-purpose servers and simultaneously summarize the typical performance bottlenecks in NFV. Through reviewing the progress in the field of NFV acceleration, we present a new taxonomy of the state-of-the-art efforts according to various acceleration approaches. We discuss the surveyed works and identify the respective advantages and disadvantages in each category. We then discuss the products, solutions, and projects emerged in industry. We also present a gap analysis to improve current solutions and highlight promising research trends that can be explored in the future.},

Secure data provenance is crucial for data accountability, forensics and privacy. In this paper, we propose a decentralized and trusted cloud data provenance architecture using blockchain technology. Blockchain-based data provenance can provide tamper-proof records, enable the transparency of data accountability in the cloud, and help to enhance the privacy and availability of the provenance data. We make use of the cloud storage scenario and choose the cloud file as a data unit to detect user operations for collecting provenance data. We design and implement ProvChain, an architecture to collect and verify cloud data provenance, by embedding the provenance data into blockchain transactions. ProvChain operates mainly in three phases: (1) provenance data collection, (2) provenance data storage, and (3) provenance data validation. Results from performance evaluation demonstrate that ProvChain provides security features including tamper-proof provenance, user privacy and reliability with low overhead for the cloud storage applications.},

This unavailability of data challenges performing scientific sound experiments. Especially, for machine learning based systems this unavailability effectively hinders us to assess performance, attributes and limitations of such systems. One approach to address this lack of publicly available data is to perform experiments using synthetic data. However, we experience that synthetic data is seldom used in our community. This position paper gives a plea for utilising synthetic data when performing machine learning based cyber-security experiments. For this, we collect major challenges our community faces today and discuss how synthetic data can help solving them.

abstract = {New viewpoints of covert channels are presented in this work. First, the origin of covert channels is traced back to acc ess control and a new class of covert channel, air-gap covert channels, is presented. Second, we study the design of covert channels and provide novel insights that differentiate the research area of undetectable communication from that of covert channels. Third, we argue that secure systems can be characterized as fixed-source systems or continuous-source systems, i.e., systems whose security is compromised if their design allows a covert channel to communicate a small, fixed amount of information or communicate information at a sufficiently high, continuous rate, respectively. Consequently, we challenge the traditional method for measuring covert channels, which is based on Shannon capacity, and propose that a new measure, steganographic capacity, be used to accurately assess the risk posed by covert channels, particularly those affecting fixed-source systems. Additionally, our comprehensive review of covert channels has led us to the conclusion that important properties of covert channels have not been captured in previous taxonomies. We, therefore, present novel extensions to existing taxonomies to more accurately characterize covert channels.},

abstract = {Network-based malware has posed serious threats to the security of host machines. When malware adopts a private TCP/IP stack for communications, personal and network firewalls may fail to identify the malicious traffic. Current firewall policies do not have a convenient update mechanism, which makes the malicious traffic detection difficult.In this paper, we propose Software-Defined Firewall (SDF), a new security design to protect host machines and enable programmable security policy control by abstracting the firewall architecture into control and data planes. The control plane strengthens the easy security control policy update, as in the SDN (Software-Defined Networking) architecture. The difference is that it further collects host information to provide application-level traffic control and improve the malicious traffic detection accuracy. The data plane accommodates all incoming/outgoing network traffic in a network hardware to avoid malware bypassing it. The design of SDF is easy to be implemented and deployed in today's network. We implement a prototype of SDF and evaluate its performance in real-world experiments. Experimental results show that SDF can successfully monitor all network traffic (i.e., no traffic bypassing) and improves the accuracy of malicious traffic identification. Two examples of use cases indicate that SDF provides easier and more flexible solutions to today's host security problems than current firewalls.},

Robotic arms are integral to this vision. However the benefits of SM, enabled by automation and networking, also come with cyber risks. In this work, we propose an anomaly detection framework for robotic arms in a manufacturing pipeline and integrate it into Robot Operating System (ROS), a middleware framework whose variants are being considered for deployment in industrial environments for flexible automation. In particular, we explore whether the repetitive behavior of an industrial arm can be leveraged to detect anomalous behaviour that may indicate an intrusion. Based on a learned model, we classify a robot's actions as anomalous or benign. We introduce the notion of a 'tolerance envelope' to train a supervised learning model. Our empirical evaluation shows that anomalies that take the robot out of pre-determined tolerance levels can be detected with high accuracy.},

abstract = {With the high demand for wireless data traffic, WiFi networks have experienced very rapid growth, because they provide high throughput and are easy to deploy. Recently, Channel State Information (CSI) measured by WiFi networks is widely used for different sensing purposes. To get a better understanding of existing WiFi sensing technologies and future WiFi sensing trends, this survey gives a comprehensive review of the signal processing techniques, algorithms, applications, and performance results of WiFi sensing with CSI. Different WiFi sensing algorithms and signal processing techniques have their own advantages and limitations and are suitable for different WiFi sensing applications. The survey groups CSI-based WiFi sensing applications into three categories, detection, recognition, and estimation, depending on whether the outputs are binary/multi-class classifications or numerical values. With the development and deployment of new WiFi technologies, there will be more WiFi sensing opportunities wherein the targets may go beyond from humans to environments, animals, and objects. The survey highlights three challenges for WiFi sensing: robustness and generalization, privacy and security, and coexistence of WiFi sensing and networking. Finally, the survey presents three future WiFi sensing trends, i.e., integrating cross-layer network information, multi-device cooperation, and fusion of different sensors, for enhancing existing WiFi sensing capabilities and enabling new WiFi sensing opportunities.},

abstract = {Smartphones have emerged as one of the dominant computing platforms in today's era where Android has been the first choice for users as well as app developers due to its open source nature and feature rich apps. Such popularity has come hand-in-hand with an equivalent increase in malware targeting Android. Since mobile devices allow easy-to-use, touch-sensitive, and anywhere-anytime access to its resources, the mobile-specific applications like SMS, MMS, Bluetooth, e-mail, and other services may pose serious threats and lead to financial losses and privacy leakages. In recent time, high attention is drawn by the researchers for detecting Android malware; very fewer community have considered network traffic analysis in their detection models. The majority of these models have considered the detection primarily on traffic features that distinguish malware traffic from normal traffic. In this paper, we have proposed an algorithm to prioritize network traffic features with an aim to minimize the number of features to be analyzed to give high detection accuracy along with reduced training and testing time. To this extent, we have used statistical tests to rank the features. Results demonstrate that using prioritized features for detection not only reduces the training and testing time, but also gives slightly higher detection accuracy than using all the features together by measuring Fmeasure, a widely used measure for detection accuracy. The training time of 300 applications is reduced from 11.7 seconds to 5.8 seconds and testing time of 230 applications is reduced from 25.1 seconds to 17.3 seconds, hence reduction of around 50% and 31% in training time and testing time respectively. We believe this time difference will have a larger impact if there are thousands of files to be tested.},

abstract = {Recent studies show that Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are vulnerable to adversarial samples that are generated by perturbing correctly classified inputs to cause the misclassification of DNN models. This can potentially lead to disastrous consequences, especially in security-sensitive applications such as unmanned vehicles, finance and healthcare. Existing adversarial defense methods require a variety of computing units to effectively detect the adversarial samples. However, deploying adversary sample defense methods in existing DNN accelerators leads to many key issues in terms of cost, computational efficiency and information security. Moreover, existing DNN accelerators cannot provide effective support for special computation required in the defense methods.To address these new challenges, this paper proposes DNNGuard, an elastic heterogeneous DNN accelerator architecture that can efficiently orchestrate the simultaneous execution of original (target) DNN networks and the detect algorithm or network that detects adversary sample attacks. The architecture tightly couples the DNN accelerator with the CPU core into one chip for efficient data transfer and information protection. An elastic DNN accelerator is designed to run the target network and detection network simultaneously. Besides the capability to execute two networks at the same time, DNNGuard also supports the non-DNN computing and allows the special layer of the neural network to be effectively supported by the CPU core. To reduce off-chip traffic and improve resources utilization, we propose a dynamical resource scheduling mechanism. To build a general implementation framework, we propose an extended AI instruction set for neural networks synchronization, task scheduling and efficient data interaction. We implement DNNGuard based on RISC-V and NVDLA, and evaluate its performance impacts with six target networks and three typical detection networks. Experiment results show that DNNGuard can effectively validate the legitimacy of the input samples in parallel with the target DNN model, achieving an average 1.42x speedup compared with the state-of-the-art accelerators.},

abstract = { The increasing application of ICT technologies to medicine opens new usage patterns. Among the various standards, the Digital Imaging and COmmunication in Medicine (DICOM) has been gaining momentum, mainly due to its complete coverage of the diagnostic pipeline, including key applications such as CT, MRI and ultrasound scanners. However, owing to its complex and multifaceted nature, DICOM is prone to many risks especially due to the vast and complex attack surface characterizing the composite interplay of services, formats and technologies at the basis of the standard. Luckily, DICOM exhibits some room for improving its security. Specifically, information hiding and steganography can be used in a twofold manner. On one hand, they can help to watermark diagnostic images to improve their resistance against tampering and alterations. On the other hand, the digital infrastructure at the basis of DICOM can lead to data leaks or malicious manipulations via artificial intelligence techniques. Therefore, in this work we introduce risks and opportunities when applying information-hiding-based techniques to the DICOM standard. Our investigation highlights some opportunities as well as introduces possibilities of exploiting DICOM images to set up covert channels, i.e., hidden communication paths that can be used to exfiltrate data or launch attacks. To prove the effectiveness of our vision, this paper also showcases the performance evaluation of a covert channel built by applying text steganography principles on realistic DICOM images.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen a dramatic and rapid paradigm shift in computing from static control systems (often implemented in hardware), to dynamic, easily-reconfigurable, software-defined systems. The researchers and practitioners have just begun to scratch the surface of how the ever-increasing software-defined everything (SD-X) changes the landscape of cybersecurity. On one hand, a software-defined world adds potentially new attack surfaces that deserve new research investigation. On the other hand, considering the fact that everything can be defined by the software, now we can have a new playground to redesign the security mechanisms and services. With programmable security, we can also better embrace the new advances in big data and AI to provide more intelligent and adaptive security for the software-defined world. We believe the opportunity is ripe for academics to make foundational contributions, collaboratively with industry, to shape the next 5 years of research in this new space, SPS (Software-defined Programmable Security). Emerging data centers, cloud networks, IoT and edge computing also provide a fertile playground to consider disruptive software-defined programmable security designs.}

abstract = {In this article we propose to couple reputation systems for wireless sensor networks with a genetic algorithm in order to improve their time of response to adversarial activities. The reputation of each node is assigned by an unsupervised genetic algorithm trained for detecting outliers in the data. The response of the system consists in assigning low reputation values to the compromised nodes cutting them off from the rest of the network. The genetic algorithm uses the feature extraction process that does not capture the properties of the attacks, but rather relies on the existing temporal and spatial redundancy in sensor networks and tries to detect temporal and spatial inconsistencies in the sequences of sensed values and the routing paths used to forward these values to the base station. This solution offers many benefits: scalable solution, fast response to thwart activities, ability to detect unknown attacks, high adaptability, and high ability in detecting and confining attacks. Comparing to the standard clustering algorithms, the benefit of this one is that it is not necessary to assign the number of clusters from the beginning. The solution is also robust to both parameter changes and the presence of large amounts of malicious data in the training and testing datasets.},

abstract = {Several applications, like malicious URL detection and web spam detection, require classification on very high-dimensional data. In such cases anomalous data is hard to find but normal data is easily available. As such it is increasingly common to use a one-class classifier (OCC). Unfortunately, most OCC algorithms cannot scale to datasets with extremely high dimensions. In this paper, we present Fast Random projection-based One-Class Classification (FROCC), an extremely efficient, scalable and easily parallelizable method for one-class classification with provable theoretical guarantees. Our method is based on the simple idea of transforming the training data by projecting it onto a set of random unit vectors that are chosen uniformly and independently from the unit sphere, and bounding the regions based on separation of the data. FROCC can be naturally extended with kernels. We provide a new theoretical framework to prove that that FROCC generalizes well in the sense that it is stable and has low bias for some parameter settings. We then develop a fast scalable approximation of FROCC using vectorization, exploiting data sparsity and parallelism to develop a new implementation called ParDFROCC. ParDFROCC achieves up to 2 percent points better ROC than the next best baseline, with up to 12\texttimes{} speedup in training and test times over a range of state-of-the-art benchmarks for the OCC task.},

abstract = {Global investment and recent advancements in vehicle automation are making autonomous and cooperative automated driving (AD) a reality. Not only will automated vehicles incorporate more electronics and connectivity than ever before, but also, notably, they will transfer control and responsibility of monitoring the environment from a human driver to a robotic system. While prior work has assessed and provided security solutions for non-automated vehicles, there is much to understand regarding the security implications of AD. In this work, we begin to address this gap in understanding. This paper reports on a risk assessment framework for autonomous and cooperative AD. We aggregate the state of the art in AD research to define a reference architecture for automated vehicles, describing the new attack surfaces and data flow. Employing existing automotive threat models, we propose a novel application-based threat enumeration and analysis approach that is able to address different AD applications across all levels of automation. We demonstrate this framework with an example application assessment and summarize the results and security insights from analyses of other applications. The results of our risk assessment and future assessments with this framework will inform on the design of security solutions and secure architectures for production AD systems.},

Previous hardware solutions usually mandate drastic change to internal processor architecture. More recent ones to minimize the change have proposed external devices for DIFT. However, these approaches intrinsically suffer from the high overhead to communicate with their external devices. Consequently, they either significantly lose performance, or inevitably make invasive modifications to the processor inside. Our solution also rely on external hardware for DIFT, but unlike theirs, ours exploits the core debug interface (CDI) to tackle the communication issue. CDI is provided in most commercial processors for debugging so that we were able to build our system simply by plugging our hardware to the processor via CDI, precluding the need for altering the processor itself. Experiments show that our hardware efficiently performs DIFT mainly thanks to the support of CDI that helps us cut substantially down the communication costs.},

abstract = { Container (or containerization) as one of the new concepts of virtualization, has attracted increasing attention and occupied a considerable amount of market size owing to the inherent lightweight characteristic. However, the lightweight advantage is achieved at the price of the security. Attacks against weak isolation of the container have been reported, and the use of a shared kernel is another targeted vulnerable point. This work aims to provide secure monitoring of containerized applications, which can help i) the infrastructure owner to ensure the running application is harmless, ii) the application owner to detect anomalous behaviors. We propose to use unsupervised introspection tools to perform the non-intrusive monitoring, which leverages the system call traces to classify the anomalies. Since the traditional dataset used for anomaly detection either only focus on network traces or limited to few attributes of system calls, we crafted and collected various normal and abnormal behaviors of a containerized application, and an optimized and open-source system call based dataset has been built. Unsupervised machine learning classifiers are trained over the proposed dataset, a comprehensive case study has been performed and analyzed. The results show the feasibility of unsupervised introspection of containerized applications. },

However, the recent spate of cyber attacks exploiting the vulnerabilities and insufficient security management of IoT devices have created serious challenges for securing IoT devices and applications. As a first step towards understanding and mitigating diverse security threats of IoT devices, this paper develops a measurement framework to automatically collect network traffic of IoT devices in edge networks, and build multidimensional behavioral profiles of these devices which characterize who, when, what, and why on the behavioral patterns of IoT devices based on continuously collected traffic data. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first effort to shed light on the IP-spatial, temporal, and cloud service patterns of IoT devices in edge networks, and to explore these multidimensional behavioral fingerprints for IoT device classification, anomaly traffic detection, and network security monitoring for millions of vulnerable and resource-constrained IoT devices on the Internet.},

abstract = {Although deep learning has been applied to successfully address many data mining problems, relatively limited work has been done on deep learning for anomaly detection. Existing deep anomaly detection methods, which focus on learning new feature representations to enable downstream anomaly detection methods, perform indirect optimization of anomaly scores, leading to data-inefficient learning and suboptimal anomaly scoring. Also, they are typically designed as unsupervised learning due to the lack of large-scale labeled anomaly data. As a result, they are difficult to leverage prior knowledge (e.g., a few labeled anomalies) when such information is available as in many real-world anomaly detection applications. This paper introduces a novel anomaly detection framework and its instantiation to address these problems. Instead of representation learning, our method fulfills an end-to-end learning of anomaly scores by a neural deviation learning, in which we leverage a few (e.g., multiple to dozens) labeled anomalies and a prior probability to enforce statistically significant deviations of the anomaly scores of anomalies from that of normal data objects in the upper tail. Extensive results show that our method can be trained substantially more data-efficiently and achieves significantly better anomaly scoring than state-of-the-art competing methods.},

In principle, they all in common in regard to the monitoring of the execution behavior of a program (e.g., control-flow or dataflow) running on the machine to find symptoms of attacks. Among the proposed monitoring schemes, software-based ones are known for their adaptability on the commercial products, but there have been concerns that they may suffer from nonnegligible runtime overhead. On the other hand, hardware-based solutions are recognized for their high performance. However, most of them have an inherent problem in that they usually mandate drastic changes to the internal processor architecture. More recent ones have strived to minimize such modifications by employing external hardware security monitors in the system. However, these approaches intrinsically suffer from the overhead caused by communication between the host and the external monitor. Our solution also relies on external hardware for security monitoring, but unlike the others, ours tackles the communication overhead by using the core debug interface (CDI), which is readily available in most commercial processors for debugging. We build our system simply by plugging our monitoring hardware into the processor via CDI, precluding the need for altering the processor internals. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we implement two well-known monitoring techniques on our proposed framework: dynamic information flow tracking and branch regulation. The experimental results on our FPGA prototype show that our external hardware monitors efficiently perform monitoring tasks with negligible performance overhead, mainly with thanks to the support of CDI, which helps us reduce communication costs substantially.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have been increasingly subject to cyber-attacks including code injection attacks. Zero day attacks further exasperate the threat landscape by requiring a shift to defense in depth approaches. With the tightly coupled nature of cyber components with the physical domain, these attacks have the potential to cause significant damage if safety-critical applications such as automobiles are compromised. Moving target defense techniques such as instruction set randomization (ISR) have been commonly proposed to address these types of attacks. However, under current implementations an attack can result in system crashing which is unacceptable in CPS. As such, CPS necessitate proper control reconfiguration mechanisms to prevent a loss of availability in system operation. This paper addresses the problem of maintaining system and security properties of a CPS under attack by integrating ISR, detection, and recovery capabilities that ensure safe, reliable, and predictable system operation. Specifically, we consider the problem of detecting code injection attacks and reconfiguring the controller in real-time. The developed framework is demonstrated with an autonomous vehicle case study.},

Due to the booming development and deployment of advanced analytics solutions, novel stealing attacks utilize machine learning (ML) algorithms to achieve high success rate and cause a lot of damage. Detecting and defending against such attacks is challenging and urgent so governments, organizations, and individuals should attach great importance to the ML-based stealing attacks. This survey presents the recent advances in this new type of attack and corresponding countermeasures. The ML-based stealing attack is reviewed in perspectives of three categories of targeted controlled information, including controlled user activities, controlled ML model-related information, and controlled authentication information. Recent publications are summarized to generalize an overarching attack methodology and to derive the limitations and future directions of ML-based stealing attacks. Furthermore, countermeasures are proposed towards developing effective protections from three aspects—detection, disruption, and isolation.},

At the same time, however, this has opened up new, and perhaps more severe, possibilities for attacks. In this paper, we explore a novel generation of mobile malware that exploits the rich variety of sensors available on current mobile devices.Two properties distinguish the proposed malware from the existing state-of-the-art. First, in addition to the misuse of the various traditional services available on modern mobile devices, this malware can be used for the purpose of targeted context-aware attacks. Second, this malware can be commanded and controlled over context-aware, out-of-band channels as opposed to a centralized infrastructure. These communication channels can be used to quickly reach out to a large number of infected devices, while offering a high degree of undetectability. In particular, unlike traditional network-based communication, the proposed sensing-enabled channels cannot be detected by monitoring the cellular or wireless communication networks. To demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed attack, we present different flavors of command and control channels based on acoustic, visual, magnetic and vibrational signaling. We further build and test a proof-of-concept Android application implementing many such channels.},

abstract = {In this work, we present a simple, yet effective and practical scheme to improve the security of stored password hashes, increasing the difficulty to crack passwords and exposing cracking attempts. We utilize a hardware-dependent function (HDF), such as a physically unclonable function (PUF) or a hardware security module (HSM), at the authentication server to inhibit offline password discovery. Additionally, a deception mechanism is incorporated to alert administrators of cracking attempts. Using an HDF to generate password hashes hinders attackers from recovering the true passwords without constant access to the HDF. Our scheme can integrate with legacy systems without needing additional servers, changing the structure of the hashed password file, nor modifying client machines. When using our scheme, the structure of the hashed passwords file, e.g., etc/shadow or etc/master.passwd, will appear no different than traditional hashed password files.1 However, when attackers exfiltrate the hashed password file and attempt to crack it, the passwords they will receive are ErsatzPasswords—“fake passwords.”The ErsatzPasswords scheme is flexible by design, enabling it to be integrated into existing authentication systems without changes to user experience. The proposed scheme is integrated into the pam_unix module as well as two client/server authentication schemes: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication and the Pythia pseudorandom function (PRF) Service [Everspaugh et al. 2015]. The core library to support ErsatzPasswords written in C and Python consists of 255 and 103 lines of code, respectively. The integration of ErsatzPasswords into each explored authentication system required less than 100 lines of additional code. Experimental evaluation of ErsatzPasswords shows an increase in authentication latency on the order of 100ms, which maybe acceptable for real world systems. We also describe a framework for implementing ErsatzPasswords using a Trusted Platform Module (TPM).},

abstract = {In this paper, through reverse engineering Twitter spammers' tastes (their preferred targets to spam), we aim at providing guidelines for building more effective social honeypots, and generating new insights to defend against social spammers. Specifically, we first perform a measurement study by deploying "benchmark" social honeypots on Twitter with diverse and fine-grained social behavior patterns to trap spammers. After five months' data collection, we make a deep analysis on how Twitter spammers find their targets. Based on the analysis, we evaluate our new guidelines for building effective social honeypots by implementing "advanced" honeypots. Particularly, within the same time period, using those advanced honeypots can trap spammers around 26 times faster than using "traditional" honeypots.In the second part of our study, we investigate new active collection approaches to complement the fundamentally passive procedure of using honeypots to slowly attract spammers. Our goal is that, given limited resources/time, instead of blindly crawling all possible (or randomly sampling) Twitter accounts at the first place (for later spammer analysis), we need a lightweight strategy to prioritize the active crawling/sampling of more likely spam accounts from the huge Twittersphere. Applying what we have learned about the tastes of spammers, we design two new, active and guided sampling approaches for collecting most likely spammer accounts during the crawling. According to our evaluation, our strategies could efficiently crawl/sample over 17,000 spam accounts within a short time with a considerably high "Hit Ratio", i.e., collecting 6 correct spam accounts in every 10 sampled accounts.},

abstract = {Machine learning relies on the assumption that unseen test instances of a classification problem follow the same distribution as observed training data. However, this principle can break down when machine learning is used to make important decisions about the welfare (employment, education, health) of strategic individuals. Knowing information about the classifier, such individuals may manipulate their attributes in order to obtain a better classification outcome. As a result of this behavior -- often referred to as gaming -- the performance of the classifier may deteriorate sharply. Indeed, gaming is a well-known obstacle for using machine learning methods in practice; in financial policy-making, the problem is widely known as Goodhart's law. In this paper, we formalize the problem, and pursue algorithms for learning classifiers that are robust to gaming.We model classification as a sequential game between a player named "Jury" and a player named "Contestant." Jury designs a classifier, and Contestant receives an input to the classifier drawn from a distribution. Before being classified, Contestant may change his input based on Jury's classifier. However, Contestant incurs a cost for these changes according to a cost function. Jury's goal is to achieve high classification accuracy with respect to Contestant's original input and some underlying target classification function, assuming Contestant plays best response. Contestant's goal is to achieve a favorable classification outcome while taking into account the cost of achieving it.For a natural class of "separable" cost functions, and certain generalizations, we obtain computationally efficient learning algorithms which are near optimal, achieving a classification error that is arbitrarily close to the theoretical minimum. Surprisingly, our algorithms are efficient even on concept classes that are computationally hard to learn. For general cost functions, designing an approximately optimal strategy-proof classifier, for inverse-polynomial approximation, is NP-hard.},

Advanced network scanning techniques are often used for this purpose and are automatically executed by malware infected hosts. In this paper we formally define network deception to defend reconnaissance and develop RDS (Reconnaissance Deception System), which is based on SDN (Software Defined Networking), to achieve deception by simulating virtual network topologies. Our system thwarts network reconnaissance by delaying the scanning techniques of adversaries and invalidating their collected information, while minimizing the performance impact on benign network traffic. We introduce approaches to defend malicious network discovery and reconnaissance in computer networks, which are required for targeted cyber attacks such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). We show, that our system is able to invalidate an attackers information, delay the process of finding vulnerable hosts and identify the source of adversarial reconnaissance within a network, while only causing a minuscule performance overhead of 0.2 milliseconds per packet flow on average.},

However, in real-world scenarios, trajectory outliers can often appear in groups, e.g., a group of bikes that deviates to the usual trajectory due to the maintenance of streets in the context of intelligent transportation. The current paper considers the Group Trajectory Outlier (GTO) problem and proposes three algorithms. The first and the second algorithms are extensions of the well-known DBSCAN and kNN algorithms, while the third one models the GTO problem as a feature selection problem. Furthermore, two different enhancements for the proposed algorithms are proposed. The first one is based on ensemble learning and computational intelligence, which allows for merging algorithms’ outputs to possibly improve the final result. The second is a general high-performance computing framework that deals with big trajectory databases, which we used for a GPU-based implementation. Experimental results on different real trajectory databases show the scalability of the proposed approaches.},

abstract = {The openness and extensibility of Android have made it a popular platform for mobile devices and a strong candidate to drive the Internet-of-Things. Unfortunately, these properties also leave Android vulnerable, attracting attacks for profit or fun. To mitigate these threats, numerous issue-specific solutions have been proposed. With the increasing number and complexity of security problems and solutions, we believe this is the right moment to step back and systematically re-evaluate the Android security architecture and security practices in the ecosystem. We organize the most recent security research on the Android platform into two categories: the software stack and the ecosystem. For each category, we provide a comprehensive narrative of the problem space, highlight the limitations of the proposed solutions, and identify open problems for future research. Based on our collection of knowledge, we envision a blueprint for engineering a secure, next-generation Android ecosystem.},

abstract = {The abuse of chat services by automated programs, known as chat bots, poses a serious threat to Internet users. Chat bots target popular chat networks to distribute spam and malware. In this paper, we first conduct a series of measurements on a large0 commercial chat network. Our measurements capture a total of 16 different types of chat bots ranging from simple to advanced. Moreover, we observe that human behavior is more complex than bot behavior. Based on the measurement study, we propose a classification system to accurately distinguish chat bots from human users. The proposed classification system consists of two components: 1) an entropy-based classifier; and 2) a Bayesian-based classifier. The two classifiers complement each other in chat bot detection. The entropy-based classifier is more accurate to detect unknown chat bots, whereas the Bayesian-based classifier is faster to detect known chat bots. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed classification system is highly effective in differentiating bots from humans.},

abstract = {Wildlife poaching presents a serious extinction threat to many animal species. Agencies ("defenders") focused on protecting such animals need tools that help analyze, model and predict poacher activities, so they can more effectively combat such poaching; such tools could also assist in planning effective defender patrols, building on the previous security games research.To that end, we have built a new predictive anti-poaching tool, CAPTURE (Comprehensive Anti-Poaching tool with Temporal and observation Uncertainty REasoning). CAPTURE provides four main contributions. First, CAPTURE's modeling of poachers provides significant advances over previous models from behavioral game theory and conservation biology. This accounts for:(i) the defender's imperfect detection of poaching signs; (ii) complex temporal dependencies in the poacher's behaviors; (iii) lack of knowledge of numbers of poachers. Second, we provide two new heuristics: parameter separation and target abstraction to reduce the computational complexity in learning the poacher models. Third, we present a new game-theoretic algorithm for computing the defender's optimal patrolling given the complex poacher model. Finally, we present detailed models and analysis of real-world poaching data collected over 12 years in Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda to evaluate our new model's prediction accuracy. This paper thus presents the largest dataset of real-world defender-adversary interactions analyzed in the security games literature. CAPTURE will be tested in Uganda in early 2016.},

However, users may not be willing to pay additional fees only because they use their bandwidth dierently, and may consider tethering detection as violation of their privacy. Furthermore, accurate tethering detection is becoming harder for providers as many modern smartphones are under full control of the user, running customized, complex software and applications similar to desktop systems.In this work, we analyze the network characteristics available to network providers to detect tethering customers. We present and categorize possible detection mechanisms and derive cost factors based on how well the approach scales with large customer bases. For those characteristics that appear most reasonable and practical to deploy by large providers, we present elimination or obfuscation mechanisms and substantiate our design with a prototype Android App.},

abstract = {USB attacks are becoming more sophisticated. Rather than using USB devices solely as a delivery mechanism for host-side exploits, attackers are targeting the USB stack itself, embedding malicious code in device firmware to covertly request additional USB interfaces, providing unacknowledged and malicious functionality that lies outside the apparent purpose of the device. This allows for attacks such as BadUSB, where a USB storage device with malicious firmware is capable of covertly acting as a keyboard as well, allowing it to inject malicious scripts into the host machine. We observe that the root cause of such attacks is that the USB Stack exposes a set of unrestricted device privileges and note that the most reliable information about a device's capabilities comes from the end user's expectation of the device's functionality. We design and implement GoodUSB, a mediation architecture for the Linux USB Stack. We defend against BadUSB attacks by enforcing permissions based on user expectations of device functionality. GoodUSB includes a security image component to simplify use, and a honeypot mechanism for observing suspicious USB activities. GoodUSB introduces only 5.2% performance overhead compared to the unmodified Linux USB subsystem. It is an important step forward in defending against USB attacks and towards allowing the safe deployment of USB devices in the enterprise.},

abstract = {Malware detection increasingly relies on machine learning techniques, which utilize multiple features to separate the malware from the benign apps. The effectiveness of these techniques primarily depends on the manual feature engineering process, based on human knowledge and intuition. However, given the adversaries' efforts to evade detection and the growing volume of publications on malware behaviors, the feature engineering process likely draws from a fraction of the relevant knowledge. We propose an end-to-end approach for automatic feature engineering. We describe techniques for mining documents written in natural language (e.g. scientific papers) and for representing and querying the knowledge about malware in a way that mirrors the human feature engineering process. Specifically, we first identify abstract behaviors that are associated with malware, and then we map these behaviors to concrete features that can be tested experimentally. We implement these ideas in a system called FeatureSmith, which generates a feature set for detecting Android malware. We train a classifier using these features on a large data set of benign and malicious apps. This classifier achieves a 92.5% true positive rate with only 1% false positives, which is comparable to the performance of a state-of-the-art Android malware detector that relies on manually engineered features. In addition, FeatureSmith is able to suggest informative features that are absent from the manually engineered set and to link the features generated to abstract concepts that describe malware behaviors.},

abstract = {The number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices actively communicating across the Internet is continually increasing, as these devices are deployed across a variety of sectors, constantly transferring private data across the Internet. Due to the extensive deployment of such devices, the continuous discovery and persistence of IoT-centric vulnerabilities in protocols, applications, hardware, and the improper management of such IoT devices has resulted in the rampant, uncontrolled spread of malware threatening consumer IoT devices.To this end, this work adopts a novel, macroscopic methodology for fingerprinting Internet-scale compromised IoT devices, revealing crucial cyber threat intelligence on the insecurity of consumer IoT devices. By developing data-driven techniques rooted in machine learning methods and analyzing 3.6 TB of network traffic data, we discover 855,916 compromised IP addresses, with 310,164 fingerprinted as IoT. Further analysis reveals China and Brazil to be hosting the most significant population of compromised IoT devices (100,000 and 55,000, respectively). Additionally, we provide a longitudinal analysis on data from one year ago against this work, revealing the evolving trends of IoT exploitation, such as the increased number of vendors targeted by malware, rising from 50 to 131. Moreover, countries such as China (420% increased infected IoT count) and Indonesia (177% increased infected IoT count) have seen notably high increases in infection rates. Last, we compare our geographic results against Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) ratings, verifying that countries with high GCI ratings, such as the Netherlands and Germany, had relatively low infection rates. However, upon further inspection, we find that the GCI rate does not accurately represent the consumer IoT market, with countries such as China and Russia being rated with “high” CGI scores, yet hosting a large population of infected consumer IoT devices.},

abstract = {One of Android's main defense mechanisms against malicious apps is a risk communication mechanism which, before a user installs an app, warns the user about the permissions the app requires, trusting that the user will make the right decision. This approach has been shown to be ineffective as it presents the risk information of each app in a "tand-alone" ashion and in a way that requires too much technical knowledge and time to distill useful information.We introduce the notion of risk scoring and risk ranking for Android apps, to improve risk communication for Android apps, and identify three desiderata for an effective risk scoring scheme. We propose to use probabilistic generative models for risk scoring schemes, and identify several such models, ranging from the simple Naive Bayes, to advanced hierarchical mixture models. Experimental results conducted using real-world datasets show that probabilistic general models significantly outperform existing approaches, and that Naive Bayes models give a promising risk scoring approach.},

abstract = {Anomaly detectors are often used to produce a ranked list of statistical anomalies, which are examined by human analysts in order to extract the actual anomalies of interest. This can be exceedingly difficult and time consuming when most high-ranking anomalies are false positives and not interesting from an application perspective. In this paper, we study how to reduce the analyst's effort by incorporating their feedback about whether the anomalies they investigate are of interest or not. In particular, the feedback will be used to adjust the anomaly ranking after every analyst interaction, ideally moving anomalies of interest closer to the top. Our main contribution is to formulate this problem within the framework of online convex optimization, which yields an efficient and extremely simple approach to incorporating feedback compared to the prior state-of-the-art. We instantiate this approach for the powerful class of tree-based anomaly detectors and conduct experiments on a range of benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate the utility of incorporating feedback and advantages of our approach over the state-of-the-art. In addition, we present results on a significant cybersecurity application where the goal is to detect red-team attacks in real system audit data. We show that our approach for incorporating feedback is able to significantly reduce the time required to identify malicious system entities across multiple attacks on multiple operating systems.},

abstract = {We present LOT, a lightweight plug and play secure tunneling protocol deployed at network gateways. Two communicating gateways, A and B, running LOT would automatically detect each other and establish an efficient tunnel, securing communication between them. LOT tunnels allow A to discard spoofed packets that specify source addresses in B’s network and vice versa. This helps to mitigate many attacks, including DNS poisoning, network scans, and most notably (Distributed) Denial of Service (DoS).LOT tunnels provide several additional defenses against DoS attacks. Specifically, since packets received from LOT-protected networks cannot be spoofed, LOT gateways implement quotas, identifying and blocking packet floods from specific networks. Furthermore, a receiving LOT gateway (e.g., B) can send the quota assigned to each tunnel to the peer gateway (A), which can then enforce near-source quotas, reducing waste and congestion by filtering excessive traffic before it leaves the source network. Similarly, LOT tunnels facilitate near-source filtering, where the sending gateway discards packets based on filtering rules defined by the destination gateway. LOT gateways also implement an intergateway congestion detection mechanism, allowing sending gateways to detect when their packets get dropped before reaching the destination gateway and to perform appropriate near-source filtering to block the congesting traffic; this helps against DoS attacks on the backbone connecting the two gateways.LOT is practical: it is easy to manage (plug and play, requires no coordination between gateways), deployed incrementally at edge gateways (not at hosts and core routers), and has negligible overhead in terms of bandwidth and processing, as we validate experimentally. LOT storage requirements are also modest.},

abstract = { Robust, secure authentication is essential in online interactions. Current best practice is to combine factors communicated using different channels; however, in some contexts multi-factor authentication may not be feasible or appropriate. Thus there is a need for authentication strategies that do not rely on classic multiple factors. While people normally rely upon multiple factors to authenticate each other, there is anecdotal evidence that such factors are not needed to authenticate close relationships, and that in fact they can recognize each other over an extremely low-bandwidth channel: texting. In this work we examine whether people who know each other well can, in fact, authenticate each other while texting in an adversarial context. We present results from a “friend imitation” game that has many similarities to Turing’s Imitation Game. Results from this user study indicate that people use a variety of syntactic and semantic techniques to authenticate each other when texting. While some of the observed techniques are not secure against adversaries with access to social media and other data sources, others leverage sophisticated mental models of the other person’s expected behaviour that can quickly be used to detect impersonation attempts. We also explore to what extent these insights could inform mechanisms for in-band non-cryptographic authentication in computer-to-human, human-to-computer, and computer-to-computer communication contexts. },

In this paper we focus on the social network Facebook and the problem of discerning ill-gotten Page Likes, made by spammers hoping to turn a profit, from legitimate Page Likes. Our method, which we refer to as CopyCatch, detects lockstep Page Like patterns on Facebook by analyzing only the social graph between users and Pages and the times at which the edges in the graph (the Likes) were created. We offer the following contributions: (1) We give a novel problem formulation, with a simple concrete definition of suspicious behavior in terms of graph structure and edge constraints. (2) We offer two algorithms to find such suspicious lockstep behavior - one provably-convergent iterative algorithm and one approximate, scalable MapReduce implementation. (3) We show that our method severely limits "greedy attacks" and analyze the bounds from the application of the Zarankiewicz problem to our setting. Finally, we demonstrate and discuss the effectiveness of CopyCatch at Facebook and on synthetic data, as well as potential extensions to anomaly detection problems in other domains. CopyCatch is actively in use at Facebook, searching for attacks on Facebook's social graph of over a billion users, many millions of Pages, and billions of Page Likes.},

While such analysis is essential for a variety of network management and security tasks, it is infeasible on many networks: either the volume of data is so large as to make packet inspection intractable, or privacy concerns forbid packet capture and require the dissociation of network flows from users’ actual IP addresses. Our analytical framework permits useful analysis of network usage patterns even under circumstances where the only available source of data is anonymized flow records. Using this data, we are able to uncover distributions and scaling relations in host-to-host networks that bear implications for capacity planning and network application design. We also show how to classify network applications based entirely on topological properties of their overlay networks, yielding a taxonomy that allows us to accurately identify the functions of unknown applications. We repeat this analysis on a more recent dataset, allowing us to demonstrate that the aggregate behavior of users is remarkably stable even as the population changes.},

abstract = {Computing systems and networks become increasingly large and complex with a variety of compromises and vulnerabilities. The network security and privacy are of great concern today, where self-defense against different kinds of attacks in an autonomous and holistic manner is a challenging topic. To address this problem, we developed an innovative technology called Bionic Autonomic Nervous System (BANS). The BANS is analogous to biological nervous system, which consists of basic modules like cyber axon, cyber neuron, peripheral nerve and central nerve. We also presented an innovative self-defense mechanism which utilizes the Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, and Entropy Awareness, etc. Equipped with the BANS, computer and network systems can intelligently self-defend against both known and unknown compromises/attacks including denial of services (DoS), spyware, malware, and virus. BANS also enabled multiple computers to collaboratively fight against some distributed intelligent attacks like DDoS. We have implemented the BANS in practice. Some case studies and experimental results exhibited the effectiveness and efficiency of the BANS and the self-defense mechanism.},

abstract = {Risks faced by information system operators and users are not only determined by their own security posture, but are also heavily affected by the security-related decisions of others. This interdependence between information system operators and users is a fundamental property that shapes the efficiency of security defense solutions. Game theory is the most appropriate method to model the strategic interactions between these participants. In this survey, we summarize game-theoretic interdependence models, characterize the emerging security inefficiencies, and present mechanisms to improve the security decisions of the participants. We focus our attention on games with interdependent defenders and do not discuss two-player attacker-defender games. Our goal is to distill the main insights from the state of the art and to identify the areas that need more attention from the research community.},

Existing libraries producing sketches are very fast, but do not allow parallelism for creating sketches using multiple threads or querying them while they are being built. We present a generic approach to parallelising data sketches efficiently and allowing them to be queried in real time, while bounding the error that such parallelism introduces. Utilising relaxed semantics and the notion of strong linearisability we prove our algorithm's correctness and analyse the error it induces in two specific sketches. Our implementation achieves high scalability while keeping the error small. We have contributed one of our concurrent sketches to the open-source data sketches library.},

abstract = {Domain generation algorithms (DGAs) prevent the connection between a botnet and its master from being blocked by generating a large number of domain names. Promising single-data-source approaches have been proposed for separating benign from DGA-generated domains. Collaborative machine learning (ML) can be used in order to enhance a classifier's detection rate, reduce its false positive rate (FPR), and to improve the classifier's generalization capability to different networks. In this paper, we complement the research area of DGA detection by conducting a comprehensive collaborative learning study, including a total of 13,440 evaluation runs. In two real-world scenarios we evaluate a total of eleven different variations of collaborative learning using three different state-of-the-art classifiers. We show that collaborative ML can lead to a reduction in FPR by up to 51.7%. However, while collaborative ML is beneficial for DGA detection, not all approaches and classifier types profit equally. We round up our comprehensive study with a thorough discussion of the privacy threats implicated by the different collaborative ML approaches.},

abstract = {Tor is a powerful and important tool for providing anonymity and censorship resistance to users around the world. Yet it is surprisingly difficult to deploy new services in Tor—it is largely relegated to proxies and hidden services—or to nimbly react to new forms of attack. Conversely, “non-anonymous” Internet services are thriving like never before because of recent advances in programmable networks, such as Network Function Virtualization (NFV) which provides programmable in-network middleboxes.This paper seeks to close this gap by introducing programmable middleboxes into the Tor network. In this architecture, users can install and run sophisticated “functions” on willing Tor routers. We demonstrate a wide range of functions that improve anonymity, resilience to attack, performance of hidden services, and more. We present the design and implementation of an architecture, Bento, that protects middlebox nodes from the functions they run—and protects the functions from the middleboxes they run on.We evaluate Bento by running it on the live Tor network. We show that, with just a few lines of Python, we can significantly extend the capabilities of Tor to meet users' anonymity needs and nimbly react to new threats. We will be making our code and data publicly available.},

abstract = {Emerging applications in connected vehicles have tremendous potential for advances in safety, navigation, traffic management and fuel efficiency, while also posing new security challenges such as false information attacks. This paper targets the problem of securing critical information that is disseminated among nearby vehicles for safety and traffic efficiency purposes through distributed consensus. We present a consensus algorithm, which uses a "proof of eligibility" test to establish that a group of vehicles are actually within the vicinity of the information source. With the presence of a limited number of compromised (Byzantine faulty) participants, our algorithm provides correct consensus among healthy vehicles in real time. The algorithm provides fast and reliable consensus group formation and private key distribution without privileged members, trusted setup, or leader election. In addition to proving a safety property of our consensus algorithm, we have implemented it on top of a widely-used vehicle simulation environment (SUMO, OMNeT++ and Veins) and evaluated its performance on a model of the streets in a real midtown area. Simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm can reach consensus very efficiently (within 9.5s) and with up to 30% of compromised vehicles in a given area. The simulations also demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to more quickly disseminate information about a traffic accident and more efficiently route traffic around the accident site, as compared to previous robust information dissemination approaches.},

To evaluate the capabilities of a host profiling attack, we design Hostbuster, a tool that reidentifies hosts based on network flow data. We experimentally evaluate its effectiveness using real-world network traffic from the University of Oxford. We show the robustness of learned host profiles, which are valid for more than two months. On average, our experiments result in 80% classification performance given by the F1 score. As a result of these analyses, we provide guidelines to strengthen NMTD against these types of attacks.},

abstract = {Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown great success in deep representations learning, data generation, and security enhancement. With the development of the Internet of Things, 5th generation wireless systems (5G), and other technologies, the large volume of data collected at the edge of networks provides a new way to improve the capabilities of GANs. Due to privacy, bandwidth, and legal constraints, it is not appropriate to upload all the data to the cloud or servers for processing. Therefore, this article focuses on deploying and training GANs at the edge rather than converging edge data to the central node. To address this problem, we designed a novel distributed learning architecture for GANs, called DANCE. DANCE can adaptively perform communication compression based on the available bandwidth, while supporting both data and model parallelism training of GANs. In addition, inspired by the gossip mechanism and Stackelberg game, a compatible algorithm, AC-GAN is proposed. The theoretical analysis guarantees the convergence of the model and the existence of approximate equilibrium in AC-GAN. Both simulation and prototype system experiments show that AC-GAN can achieve better training effectiveness with less communication overhead than the SOTA algorithms, i.e., FL-GAN and MD-GAN.},

This paper aims to determine which qualitative research methods were most used and for studying which topics.

The review covered the most recent research in different areas of cybersecurity (i.e., personal, organizational and state cybersecurity) in the period of 2017 to 2019. After careful inspection of papers, we identified 160 papers reporting on the use of qualitative methods. The most common qualitative methods are interviews, followed by case studies and observation. Other studied qualitative methods (i.e., focus groups, grounded theory, action research and Delphi method) seem to be much less frequent. Although qualitative methods are used when studying all key cybersecurity areas, they often lack the necessary rigor and detail observed in other research areas where qualitative methods are well-established.},

abstract = {While deep learning has shown a great potential in various domains, the lack of transparency has limited its application in security or safety-critical areas. Existing research has attempted to develop explanation techniques to provide interpretable explanations for each classification decision. Unfortunately, current methods are optimized for non-security tasks ( e.g., image analysis). Their key assumptions are often violated in security applications, leading to a poor explanation fidelity. In this paper, we propose LEMNA, a high-fidelity explanation method dedicated for security applications. Given an input data sample, LEMNA generates a small set of interpretable features to explain how the input sample is classified. The core idea is to approximate a local area of the complex deep learning decision boundary using a simple interpretable model. The local interpretable model is specially designed to (1) handle feature dependency to better work with security applications ( e.g., binary code analysis); and (2) handle nonlinear local boundaries to boost explanation fidelity. We evaluate our system using two popular deep learning applications in security (a malware classifier, and a function start detector for binary reverse-engineering). Extensive evaluations show that LEMNA's explanation has a much higher fidelity level compared to existing methods. In addition, we demonstrate practical use cases of LEMNA to help machine learning developers to validate model behavior, troubleshoot classification errors, and automatically patch the errors of the target models.},

abstract = { Current popular phishing prevention techniques mainly utilize reactive blocklists, which leave a “window of opportunity” for attackers during which victims are unprotected. One possible approach to shorten this window aims to detect phishing attacks earlier, during website preparation, by monitoring Certificate Transparency (CT) logs. Previous attempts to work with CT log data for phishing classification exist, however they lack evaluations on actual CT log data. In this paper, we present a pipeline that facilitates such evaluations by addressing a number of problems when working with CT log data. The pipeline includes dataset creation, training, and past or live classification of CT logs. Its modular structure makes it possible to easily exchange classifiers or verification sources to support ground truth labeling efforts and classifier comparisons. We test the pipeline on a number of new and existing classifiers, and find a general potential to improve classifiers for this scenario in the future. We publish the source code of the pipeline and the used datasets along with this paper&nbsp;[12], thus making future research in this direction more accessible.},

Modulation is performed by modifying the environment by moving a physically actuated machine resulting in a change to the channel response that is measurable by a distant receiver capable of collecting CSI samples. An attacker can use this to exfiltrate data when transmission using conventional methods is impossible, yet the attacker controls a moving mechanism. We discuss the design of the covert channel in detail and produce a proof of concept implementation to evaluate the performance in terms of communication quality. We find that even a simple implementation provides robust communication in an office environment. Additionally, we present several countermeasures against an attack of this type.},

abstract = {Real-time predictive applications can demand continuous and agile development, with new models constantly being trained, tested, and then deployed. Training and testing are done by replaying stored event logs, running new models in the context of historical data in a form of backtesting or "what if?" analysis. To replay weeks or months of logs while developers wait, we need systems that can stream event logs through prediction logic many times faster than the real-time rate. A challenge with high-speed replay is preserving sequential semantics while harnessing parallel processing power. The crux of the problem lies with causal dependencies inherent in the sequential semantics of log replay.We introduce an execution engine that produces serial-equivalent output while accelerating throughput with pipelining and distributed parallelism. This is made possible by optimizing for high throughput rather than the traditional stream processing goal of low latency, and by aggressive sharing of versioned state, a technique we term Multi-Versioned Parallel Streaming (MVPS). In experiments we see that this engine, which we call ReStream, performs as well as batch processing and more than an order of magnitude better than a single-threaded implementation.},

Interestingly, there is practically no prior work on the detection of these entities, which are different from web crawlers or machines performing network-level reconnaissance activities such as port scanning. Detecting HTTP scanners is challenging as they are stealthy and often only probe a few key places on a website, so finding them is a needle-in-the-haystack problem. At the same time, they pose serious risk because they perform the first, exploratory step to provide the seed information that may allow hackers to compromise a website. Our work makes two main contributions. First, we propose Scanner Hunter, arguably the first method to detect HTTP scanners efficiently. The novelty and success of the method lies in the use of community structure, in an appropriately constructed bipartite graph, in order to expose groups of HTTP scanners. The rationale is that the aggregated behavior makes identifying groups of scanners easier than attempting to profile and label IP addresses individually. Scanner Hunter achieves an impressive 96.5% detection precision, which is roughly twice as high as the precision of the Machine Learning-based methods that we use as reference. Second, we provide an extensive study of HTTP scanners in an effort to understand: (a) their spatial and temporal properties, (b) the techniques and tools used by the scanners, and (c) the types of resources they are looking for, which can provides hints as to what the subsequent penetration attempt may target. We use six months worth of web traffic logs collected in 2012 from a University campus, the websites hosted by which received over 1.9 billion requests from 12.8 million IPs. We found that the number of HTTP scanners is non-trivial with roughly 4,000 IPs engaging in this type of activity per week. Our work will hopefully raise the awareness of the community regarding this problem while at the same time provide a promising detection technique that can provide the basis for mitigating the risk posed by HTTP scanners.},

abstract = {Software-Defined Networking (SDN) continues to be deployed spanning from enterprise data centers to cloud computing with the proliferation of various SDN-enabled hardware switches and dynamic control plane applications. However, state-of-the-art SDN-enabled hardware switches have rather limited downlink message processing capability, especially for <italic>Flow-Mod</italic> and <italic>Statistic Query</italic>, which may not suffice the huge need of dynamic control plane applications. In this paper, we systematically study the interactions between the control plane applications and the data plane switches, and present two new attacks, namely Control Plane Reflection Attacks, to exploit the limited processing capability of SDN-enabled hardware switches. The reflection attacks adopt direct and indirect data plane events to force the control plane to issue massive expensive downlink messages towards SDN switches. Moreover, we propose a two-phase probing-triggering attack strategy, which makes the reflection attacks much more efficient and powerful. Experiments on a testbed with 3 different physical OpenFlow switches demonstrate that the attacks can lead to catastrophic results such as hurting the establishment of new flows and even disruption of connection between SDN controller and switches. To mitigate such attacks, we present several countermeasures from different perspectives. In particular, we propose a novel, systematical defense framework, SwitchGuard, to detect anomalies of downlink messages and prioritize these messages based on a novel monitoring granularity, i.e., host-application pair (HAP). Implementations and evaluations demonstrate that SwitchGuard can effectively reduce the latency for legitimate hosts and applications under the control plane reflection attacks with only minor overheads.},

Defenders can gain advantage in this race by sharing cyber risk information with each other. Yet, they often exchange less information than is socially desirable, because sharing decisions are guided by selfish rather than altruistic reasons. A growing line of research studies these strategic aspects that drive defenders’ sharing decisions. The present survey systematizes these works in a novel framework. It provides a consolidated understanding of defenders’ strategies to privately or publicly share information and enables us to distill trends in the literature and identify future research directions. We reveal that many theoretical works assume cyber risk information sharing to be beneficial, while empirical validations are often missing.},

abstract = {We present efficient algorithms for releasing useful statistics about graph data while providing rigorous privacy guarantees. Our algorithms work on data sets that consist of relationships between individuals, such as social ties or email communication. The algorithms satisfy edge differential privacy, which essentially requires that the presence or absence of any particular relationship be hidden.Our algorithms output approximate answers to subgraph counting queries. Given a query graph H, e.g., a triangle, k-star or k-triangle, the goal is to return the number of edge-induced isomorphic copies of H in the input graph. The special case of triangles was considered by Nissim, Raskhodnikova and Smith (STOC 2007), and a more general investigation of arbitrary query graphs was initiated by Rastogi, Hay, Miklau and Suciu (PODS 2009). We extend the approach of [NRS] to a new class of statistics, namely, k-star queries. We also give algorithms for k-triangle queries using a different approach, based on the higher-order local sensitivity. For the specific graph statistics we consider (i.e., k-stars and k-triangles), we significantly improve on the work of [RHMS]: our algorithms satisfy a stronger notion of privacy, which does not rely on the adversary having a particular prior distribution on the data, and add less noise to the answers before releasing them.We evaluate the accuracy of our algorithms both theoretically and empirically, using a variety of real and synthetic data sets. We give explicit, simple conditions under which these algorithms add a small amount of noise. We also provide the average-case analysis in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi-Gilbert G(n, p) random graph model.Finally, we give hardness results indicating that the approach NRS used for triangles cannot easily be extended to k-triangles (and hence justifying our development of a new algorithmic approach).},

abstract = { In highly security-critical network environments, it is a popular design decision to offload cryptographic tasks like encryption or signature generation to a dedicated trusted module or key server with paramount security features, we in this paper refer to with the general term Cryptographic Key Management Device (CKMD). While this network design yields several benefits, we demonstrate that the use of popular counter mode encryption modes like CTR or GCM can show substantial shortcomings in terms of security when used in conjunction with this network design. In particular, we show how the use of authenticated encryption using GCM enables the possibility of establishing a subliminal channel by exploiting the authentication information within messages. We show how decoding of hidden information can proceed in addition to decryption of overt information without raising authentication failures. With an exemplary but typical infrastructure, we show how the subliminal channel might be exploited and discuss approaches to mitigating the threat by preventing the ability to embed hidden information. In contrast to previous work, we conclude that, when using an infrastructure involving a CKMD and GCM is deployed, the use of random, CKMD-generated Initialization Vectors (IVs) is beneficial to avoid the subliminal channel described in this paper. However, the most potent remedy is deploying a different operational mode like GCM-SIV. },

abstract = {Recently, we have been witnessing a rapid increase in the use of machine learning techniques in self-adaptive systems. Machine learning has been used for a variety of reasons, ranging from learning a model of the environment of a system during operation to filtering large sets of possible configurations before analyzing them. While a body of work on the use of machine learning in self-adaptive systems exists, there is currently no systematic overview of this area. Such an overview is important for researchers to understand the state of the art and direct future research efforts. This article reports the results of a systematic literature review that aims at providing such an overview. We focus on self-adaptive systems that are based on a traditional Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute (MAPE)-based feedback loop. The research questions are centered on the problems that motivate the use of machine learning in self-adaptive systems, the key engineering aspects of learning in self-adaptation, and open challenges in this area. The search resulted in 6,709 papers, of which 109 were retained for data collection. Analysis of the collected data shows that machine learning is mostly used for updating adaptation rules and policies to improve system qualities, and managing resources to better balance qualities and resources. These problems are primarily solved using supervised and interactive learning with classification, regression, and reinforcement learning as the dominant methods. Surprisingly, unsupervised learning that naturally fits automation is only applied in a small number of studies. Key open challenges in this area include the performance of learning, managing the effects of learning, and dealing with more complex types of goals. From the insights derived from this systematic literature review, we outline an initial design process for applying machine learning in self-adaptive systems that are based on MAPE feedback loops.},

abstract = {Code-reuse attack is a concrete threat to computing systems because it can evade conventional security defenses. Control flow integrity (CFI) is proposed to repel this threat. However, former implementations of CFI suffer from two major drawbacks: complex offline processing on programs and high overheads at runtime. Therefore, it is impractical for performance-constrained devices to adopt the technology, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation.In this article, we develop a cross-layer approach named basic-block-boundary-based control flow integrity (BBB-CFI) to minimize the overheads of both offline analysis and runtime checking. Our approach employs basic block information inside the binary code and read-only data to enforce CFI. We identify a key binary-level property called basic block boundary, and based on it we propose the code-inspired method where short code sequences can endorse a control flow transition. Our solution enables quick application launching because it does not require control flow graph construction at the offline stage. We only demand a lightweight analysis on read-only data and a small amount of code of the application. According to the experiments, our approach incurs a negligible 0.11% runtime performance overhead with a minor processor extension, whereas it achieves an order of magnitude speedup in pre-preprocessing compared to a baseline approach. Without control flow analysis or recompilation, BBB-CFI still effectively reduces 90% of the attack surface in terms of gadget numbers. Besides this, we show that the Turing-completeness in the libc is unsustainable. Our approach also demonstrates high applicability to many programs, and it is capable of protecting striped binaries.},

To reduce costs related to the time required to develop these devices, security features are usually not considered. This situation creates a major security concern. Many solutions have been proposed to protect IoT/IIoT against various attacks, most of which are based on attacks involving physical access. However, a new class of attacks has emerged targeting hardware vulnerabilities in the micro-architecture that do not require physical access. We present attacks based on micro-architectural hardware vulnerabilities and the side effects they produce in the system. In addition, we present security mechanisms that can be implemented to address some of these attacks. Most of the security mechanisms target a small set of attack vectors or a single specific attack vector. As many attack vectors exist, solutions must be found to protect against a wide variety of threats. This survey aims to inform designers about the side effects related to attacks and detection mechanisms that have been described in the literature. For this purpose, we present two tables listing and classifying the side effects and detection mechanisms based on the given criteria.},

abstract = {We introduce the notion of reverse-safe data structures. These are data structures that prevent the reconstruction of the data they encode (i.e., they cannot be easily reversed). A data structure D is called z-reverse-safe when there exist at least z datasets with the same set of answers as the ones stored by D. The main challenge is to ensure that D stores as many answers to useful queries as possible, is constructed efficiently, and has size close to the size of the original dataset it encodes. Given a text of length n and an integer z, we propose an algorithm that constructs a z-reverse-safe data structure (z-RSDS) that has size O(n) and answers decision and counting pattern matching queries of length at most d optimally, where d is maximal for any such z-RSDS. The construction algorithm takes O(nɷ log d) time, where ɷ is the matrix multiplication exponent. We show that, despite the nɷ factor, our engineered implementation takes only a few minutes to finish for million-letter texts. We also show that plugging our method in data analysis applications gives insignificant or no data utility loss. Furthermore, we show how our technique can be extended to support applications under realistic adversary models. Finally, we show a z-RSDS for decision pattern matching queries, whose size can be sublinear in n. A preliminary version of this article appeared in ALENEX 2020.},

abstract = {Recent studies have revealed that control programs running on embedded devices suffer from both control-oriented attacks (e.g., code-injection or code-reuse attacks) and data-oriented attacks (e.g., non-control data attacks). Unfortunately, existing detection mechanisms are insufficient to detect runtime data-oriented exploits, due to the lack of runtime execution semantics checking. In this work, we propose Orpheus, a security methodology for defending against data-oriented attacks by enforcing cyber-physical execution semantics. We address several challenges in reasoning cyber-physical execution semantics of a control program, including the event identification and dependence analysis. As an instantiation of Orpheus, we present a new program behavior model, i.e., the event-aware finite-state automaton (eFSA). eFSA takes advantage of the event-driven nature of control programs and incorporates event checking in anomaly detection. It detects data-oriented exploits if physical events and eFSA's state transitions are inconsistent. We evaluate our prototype's performance by conducting case studies under data-oriented attacks. Results show that eFSA can successfully detect different runtime attacks. Our prototype on Raspberry Pi incurs a low overhead, taking 0.0001s for each state transition integrity checking, and 0.063s~0.211s for the cyber-physical contextual consistency checking.},

abstract = {Temperature sensing and control systems are widely used in the closed-loop control of critical processes such as maintaining the thermal stability of patients, or in alarm systems for detecting temperature-related hazards. However, the security of these systems has yet to be completely explored, leaving potential attack surfaces that can be exploited to take control over critical systems.In this paper we investigate the reliability of temperature-based control systems from a security and safety perspective. We show how unexpected consequences and safety risks can be induced by physical-level attacks on analog temperature sensing components. For instance, we demonstrate that an adversary could remotely manipulate the temperature sensor measurements of an infant incubator to cause potential safety issues, without tampering with the victim system or triggering automatic temperature alarms. This attack exploits the unintended rectification effect that can be induced in operational and instrumentation amplifiers to control the sensor output, tricking the internal control loop of the victim system to heat up or cool down. Furthermore, we show how the exploit of this hardware-level vulnerability could affect different classes of analog sensors that share similar signal conditioning processes.Our experimental results indicate that conventional defenses commonly deployed in these systems are not sufficient to mitigate the threat, so we propose a prototype design of a low-cost anomaly detector for critical applications to ensure the integrity of temperature sensor signals.},

Recent attacks have shown that cyber intrusions can result in the safety of such plants being compromised - thus leading to physical damage. In this paper, we demonstrate how to ensure safety of the plant even when the system gets compromised. We leverage the fact that due to inertia, an adversary cannot destabilize the physical system (even with complete control of the software) in an instantaneous manner; in fact, it often takes finite (even considerable time). This property, coupled with system-wide restarts is used to enforce a secure (and safe) operational window for the system. A hardware root-of-trust, further decreases the ability for attackers to compromise our mechanisms. We demonstrate our approach using two realistic systems - a 3 degree of freedom (3-DoF) helicopter and a simulated warehouse temperature control unit. We also show that our system is robust against multiple emulated attacks - essentially the attackers are not able to compromise the safety of the CPS.},

However, MRT is sensitive to transient traffic spikes. In this paper, we propose three novel traffic streaming algorithms that overcome the limitations of MRT and can cater to varying degrees of computational and storage budgets, detection latency, and accuracy of query response. We evaluate our streaming algorithms on a highly parallel and programmable hardware as well as a traditional software-based platforms. The algorithms demonstrate significant accuracy improvement over MRT in detecting anomalies consisting of synthetic hard-to-track elephant flows and global icebergs. Our proposed algorithms maintain the worst-case complexities of the MRT while incurring only a moderate increase in average resource utilization.},

abstract = {An attack detection scheme is proposed to detect data integrity attacks on sensors in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). A combined fingerprint for sensor and process noise is created during the normal operation of the system. Under sensor spoofing attack, noise pattern deviates from the fingerprinted pattern enabling the proposed scheme to detect attacks. To extract the noise (difference between expected and observed value) a representative model of the system is derived. A Kalman filter is used for the purpose of state estimation. By subtracting the state estimates from the real system states, a residual vector is obtained. It is shown that in steady state the residual vector is a function of process and sensor noise. A set of time domain and frequency domain features is extracted from the residual vector. Feature set is provided to a machine learning algorithm to identify the sensor and process. Experiments are performed on two testbeds, a real-world water treatment (SWaT) facility and a water distribution (WADI) testbed. A class of zero-alarm attacks, designed for statistical detectors on SWaT are detected by the proposed scheme. It is shown that a multitude of sensors can be uniquely identified with accuracy higher than 90% based on the noise fingerprint.},

abstract = {Re-use of patients’ health records can provide tremendous benefits for clinical research. Yet, when researchers need to access sensitive/identifying data, such as genomic data, in order to compile cohorts of well-characterized patients for specific studies, privacy and security concerns represent major obstacles that make such a procedure extremely difficult if not impossible. In this paper, we address the challenge of designing and deploying in a real operational setting an efficient privacy-preserving explorer for genetic cohorts. Our solution is built on top of the i2b2 Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside framework and leverages cutting-edge privacy-enhancing technologies such as homomorphic encryption and differential privacy. Solutions involving homomorphic encryption are often believed to be costly and immature for use in operational environments. Here, we show that, for specific applications, homomorphic encryption is actually a very efficient enabler. Indeed, our solution outperforms prior work by enabling a researcher to securely compute simple statistics on more than 3,000 encrypted genetic variants simultaneously for a cohort of 5,000 individuals in less than 5 seconds with commodity hardware. To the best of our knowledge, our privacy-preserving solution is the first to also be successfully deployed and tested in a operation setting Lausanne University Hospital.},

DeepMatch delivers line-rate regular expression matching on payloads using Network Processors (NPs). It further supports packet reordering to match patterns in flows that cross packet boundaries. Our evaluation shows that an implementation of DeepMatch, on a 40 Gbps Netronome NFP-6000 SmartNIC, achieves up to line rate for streams of unrelated packets and up to 20 Gbps when searches span multiple packets within a flow. In contrast with prior work, this throughput is data-independent and adds no burstiness. DeepMatch opens new opportunities for programmable data planes.},

abstract = {Recent major attacks against unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and their controller software necessitate domain-specific cyber-physical security protection. Existing offline formal methods for (untrusted) controller code verification usually face state-explosion. On the other hand, runtime monitors for cyber-physical UAVs often lead to too-late notifications about unsafe states that makes timely safe operation recovery impossible.We present Crystal, a just-ahead-of-time control flow predictor and proactive recovery for UAVs. Crystal monitors the execution state of the flight controller and predicts the future control flows ahead of time-based on the UAV's physical dynamics. Crystal deploys the operator's countermeasures proactively in case of an upcoming unsafe state. Crystal's just-ahead-of-time model checking explores the future control flows in parallel ahead of the UAV's actual operation by some time margin. The introduced time margin enables Crystal to accommodate operator's feedback latency by the time the actual execution reaches to the identified unsafe state. Crystal periodically queries the controller's execution state. It emulates the UAV physical dynamical model and predicts future sensor measurements (controller inputs) and upcoming feasible controller's execution paths. This drives Crystal's model-checking exploration away from unreachable future states. Crystal's selective model checking saves computational time to stay ahead of execution by concentrating on relevant upcoming control flows only. This eliminates the state-explosion problem in traditional offline formal methods. We evaluated a multi-threaded prototype of Crystal between the control station server and the UAV. Crystal was able to predict upcoming hazardous states caused by the third-party controller program and proactively restored the safe states successfully with minimal overhead.},

abstract = {Deep packet inspection systems (DPI) process wire format network data from untrusted sources, collecting semantic information from a variety of protocols and file formats as they work their way upwards through the network stack. However, implementing corresponding dissectors for the potpourri of formats that today's networks carry, remains time-consuming and cumbersome, and also poses fundamental security challenges.We introduce a novel framework, Spicy, for dissecting wire format data that consists of (i) a format specification language that tightly integrates syntax and semantics; (ii) a compiler toolchain that generates efficient and robust native dissector code from these specifications just-in-time; and (iii) an extensive API for DPI applications to drive the process and leverage results. Furthermore, Spicy can reverse the process as well, assembling wire format from the high-level specifications. We pursue a number of case studies that show-case dissectors for network protocols and file formats---individually, as well as chained into a dynamic stack that processes raw packets up to application-layer content. We also demonstrate a number of example host applications, from a generic driver program to integration into Wireshark and Bro. Overall, this work provides a new capability for developing powerful, robust, and reusable dissectors for DPI applications. We publish Spicy as open-source under BSD license.},

abstract = {In wireless sensor networks, packet losses are often an indicator of possible undergoing attacks. Therefore, security solutions aiming at providing comprehensive protection must include functions for packet-loss detection. Determining the actual cause of these losses is crucial to a quick and automated reaction to the attack, be it a simple reporting of the attack or a more sophisticated action such as packet rerouting and retransmission. Packet losses in wireless sensor networks can be caused by either attacks affecting the nodes or attacks focused on the wireless links. The efficacy of the response to such attacks is highly dependent on an accurate identification of the actual attack cause. Therefore, approaches to correctly identifying the cause of packet losses are needed. The work presented in this article addresses this problem by designing and implementing a fine-grained analysis (FGA) tool that investigates packet-loss events and reports their most likely cause. Our FGA tool profiles the wireless links between the nodes, as well as their neighborhood, by leveraging resident parameters, such as RSSI and LQI, available within every received packet. The design of the system is fully distributed and event-driven, and its low overhead makes it suitable for resource-constrained entities such as wireless motes. We have validated our approach through real-world experiments, showing that our FGA tool is effective in differentiating between the various attacks that may affect nodes and links.},

abstract = {Traffic classification is essential in network management for operations ranging from capacity planning, performance monitoring, volumetry, and resource provisioning, to anomaly detection and security. Recently, it has become increasingly challenging with the widespread adoption of encryption in the Internet, e.g., as a de-facto in HTTP/2 and QUIC protocols. In the current state of encrypted traffic classification using Deep Learning (DL), we identify fundamental issues in the way it is typically approached. For instance, although complex DL models with millions of parameters are being used, these models implement a relatively simple logic based on certain header fields of the TLS handshake, limiting model robustness to future versions of encrypted protocols. Furthermore, encrypted traffic is often treated as any other raw input for DL, while crucial domain-specific considerations exist that are commonly ignored. In this paper, we design a novel feature engineering approach that generalizes well for encrypted web protocols, and develop a neural network architecture based on Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that works very well with our feature design. We evaluate our approach on a real-world traffic dataset from a major ISP and Mobile Network Operator. We achieve an accuracy of 95% in service classification with less raw traffic and smaller number of parameters, out-performing a state-of-the-art method by nearly 50% fewer false classifications. We show that our DL model generalizes for different classification objectives and encrypted web protocols. We also evaluate our approach on a public QUIC dataset with finer and application-level granularity in labeling, achieving an overall accuracy of 99%.},

abstract = {Yara rules are a ubiquitous tool among cybersecurity practitioners and analysts. Developing high-quality Yara rules to detect a malware family of interest can be labor- and time-intensive, even for expert users. Few tools exist and relatively little work has been done on how to automate the generation of Yara rules for specific families. In this paper, we leverage large n-grams (n ≥ 8) combined with a new biclustering algorithm to construct simple Yara rules more effectively than currently available software. Our method, AutoYara, is fast, allowing for deployment on low-resource equipment for teams that deploy to remote networks. Our results demonstrate that AutoYara can help reduce analyst workload by producing rules with useful true-positive rates while maintaining low false-positive rates, sometimes matching or even outperforming human analysts.In addition, real-world testing by malware analysts indicates AutoYara could reduce analyst time spent constructing Yara rules by 44-86%, allowing them to spend their time on the more advanced malware that current tools can't handle.

abstract = {Web-based malware is a growing threat to today's Internet security. Attacks of this type are prevalent and lead to serious security consequences. Millions of malicious URLs are used as distribution channels to propagate malware all over the Web. After being infected, victim systems fall in the control of attackers, who can utilize them for various cyber crimes such as stealing credentials, spamming, and distributed denial-of-service attacks. Moreover, it has been observed that traditional security technologies such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems have only limited capability to mitigate this new problem.In this article, we survey the state-of-the-art research regarding the analysis of—and defense against—Web-based malware attacks. First, we study the attack model, the root cause, and the vulnerabilities that enable these attacks. Second, we analyze the status quo of the Web-based malware problem. Third, three categories of defense mechanisms are discussed in detail: (1) building honeypots with virtual machines or signature-based detection system to discover existing threats; (2) using code analysis and testing techniques to identify the vulnerabilities of Web applications; and (3) constructing reputation-based blacklists or smart sandbox systems to protect end-users from attacks. We show that these three categories of approaches form an extensive solution space to the Web-based malware problem. Finally, we compare the surveyed approaches and discuss possible future research directions.},

abstract = {Malware and phishing are two major threats for users seeking to perform security-sensitive tasks using computers today. To mitigate these threats, we introduce Unicorn, which combines the phishing protection of standard security tokens and malware protection of trusted computing hardware. The Unicorn security token holds user authentication credentials, but only releases them if it can verify an attestation that the user's computer is free of malware. In this way, the user is released from having to remember passwords, as well as having to decide when it is safe to use them. The user's computer is further verified by either a TPM or a remote server to produce a two-factor attestation scheme. We have implemented a Unicorn prototype using commodity software and hardware, and two Unicorn example applications (termed as uApps, short for Unicorn Applications), to secure access to both remote data services and encrypted local data. Each uApp consists of a small, hardened and immutable OS image, and a single application. Our Unicorn prototype co-exists with a regular user OS, and significantly reduces the time to switch between the secure environment and general purpose environment using a novel mechanism that removes the BIOS from the switch time.},

abstract = {Today's trend toward network virtualization and software-defined networking enables flexible new distributed systems where resources can be dynamically allocated and migrated to locations where they are most useful. This paper proposes a competitive analysis approach to design and reason about online algorithms that find a good tradeoff between the benefits and costs of a migratable service. A competitive online algorithm provides worst-case performance guarantees under any demand dynamics, and without any information or statistical assumptions on the demand in the future. This is attractive especially in scenarios where the demand is hard to predict and can be subject to unexpected events. As a case study, we describe a service (e.g., an SAP server or a gaming application) that uses network virtualization to improve the quality of service (QoS) experienced by thin client applications running on mobile devices. By decoupling the service from the underlying resource infrastructure, it can be migrated closer to the current client locations while taking into account migration costs. We identify the major cost factors in such a system and formalize the wide-area service migration problem. Our main contributions are a randomized and a deterministic online algorithm that achieve a competitive ratio of $O(log {n})$ in a simplified scenario, where $n$is the size of the substrate network. This is almost optimal. We complement our worst-case analysis with simulations in different specific scenarios and also sketch a migration demonstrator.},

abstract = {Network traffic archival solutions are fundamental for a number of emerging applications that require: a) efficient storage of high-speed streams of traffic records and b) support for interactive exploration of massive datasets. Compression is a fundamental building block for any traffic archival solution. However, present solutions are tied to general-purpose compressors, which do not exploit patterns of network traffic data and require to decompress a lot of redundant data for high selectivity queries. In this work we introduce RasterZIP, a novel domain-specific compressor designed for network traffic monitoring data. RasterZIP uses an optimized lossless encoding that exploits patterns of traffic data, like the fact that IP addresses tend to share a common prefix. RasterZIP also introduces a novel decompression scheme that accelerates highly selective queries targeting a small portion of the dataset. With our solution we can achieve high-speed on-the-fly compression of more than half a million traffic records per second. We compare RasterZIP with the fastest Lempel-Ziv-based compressor and show that our solution improves the state-of-the-art both in terms of compression ratios and query response times without introducing penalty in any other performance metric.},

abstract = {Micro-architectural side-channel attacks are major threats to the most mathematically sophisticated encryption algorithms. In spite of the fact that there exist several defense techniques, the overhead of implementing the countermeasures remains a matter of concern. A promising strategy is to develop online detection and prevention methods for these attacks. Though some recent studies have devised online prevention mechanisms for some categories of these attacks, still other classes remain undetected. Moreover, to detect these side-channel attacks with minimal False Positives is a challenging effort because of the similarity of their behavior with computationally intensive applications. This article presents a generalized machine learning--based multi-layer detection technique that targets these micro-architectural side-channel attacks, while not restricting its attention only on a single category of attacks. The proposed mechanism gathers low-level system information by profiling performance counter events using Linux perf tool and then applies machine learning techniques to analyze the data. A novel approach using time-series analysis of the data is implemented to find out the correlation of the execution trace of the attack process with the secret key of encryption, which helps in dealing with False-Positives and unknown attacks. This article also provides a detailed theoretical analysis of the detection mechanism of the proposed model along with its security analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art reported techniques with high detection accuracy, low False Positives, and low implementation overhead while being able to detect before the completion of the attack.},

However, realizing such complex computation on resource-constrained wireless sensors is inefficient and even impossible on some devices. In this work, we introduce a new AKA scheme with PFS for WSNs without using any public key cryptographic primitive. To achieve PFS, we rely on a new dynamic one-time authentication credential that is regularly updated in each session. In particular, each value of the authentication credential is wisely associated with at most one session key that enables us to fulfill the security goal of PFS. Furthermore, the proposed scheme enables the principals to identify whether they have been impersonated previously. We highlight that our scheme can be very efficiently implemented on sensors since only hash function and XOR operation are required.},

abstract = {As Internet users have become more savvy about the potential for their Internet communication to be observed, the use of network traffic encryption technologies (e.g., HTTPS/TLS) is on the rise. However, even when encryption is enabled, users leak information about the domains they visit via DNS queries and via the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension of TLS. Two recent proposals to ameliorate this issue are DNS over HTTPS/TLS (DoH/DoT) and Encrypted SNI (ESNI).In this paper we aim to assess the privacy benefits of these proposals by considering the relationship between hostnames and IP addresses, the latter of which are still exposed. We perform DNS queries from nine vantage points around the globe to characterize this relationship. We quantify the privacy gain offered by ESNI for different hosting and CDN providers using two different metrics, the k -anonymity degree due to co-hosting and the dynamics of IP address changes. We find that 20% of the domains studied will not gain any privacy benefit since they have a one-to-one mapping between their hostname and IP address. On the other hand, 30% will gain a significant privacy benefit with a k value greater than 100, since these domains are co-hosted with more than 100 other domains. Domains whose visitors' privacy will meaningfully improve are far less popular, while for popular domains the benefit is not significant. Analyzing the dynamics of IP addresses of long-lived domains, we find that only 7.7% of them change their hosting IP addresses on a daily basis. We conclude by discussing potential approaches for website owners and hosting/CDN providers for maximizing the privacy benefits of ESNI.},

abstract = {Unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms search for outliers and then predict that these outliers are the anomalies. When deployed, however, these algorithms are often criticized for high false-positive and high false-negative rates. One main cause of poor performance is that not all outliers are anomalies and not all anomalies are outliers. In this article, we describe the Active Anomaly Discovery (AAD) algorithm, which incorporates feedback from an expert user that labels a queried data instance as an anomaly or nominal point. This feedback is intended to adjust the anomaly detector so that the outliers it discovers are more in tune with the expert user’s semantic understanding of the anomalies.The AAD algorithm is based on a weighted ensemble of anomaly detectors. When it receives a label from the user, it adjusts the weights on each individual ensemble member such that the anomalies rank higher in terms of their anomaly score than the outliers. The AAD approach is designed to operate in an interactive data exploration loop. In each iteration of this loop, our algorithm first selects a data instance to present to the expert as a potential anomaly and then the expert labels the instance as an anomaly or as a nominal data point. When it receives the instance label, the algorithm updates its internal model and the loop continues until a budget of B queries is spent. The goal of our approach is to maximize the total number of true anomalies in the B instances presented to the expert. We show that the AAD method performs well and in some cases doubles the number of true anomalies found compared to previous methods. In addition we present approximations that make the AAD algorithm much more computationally efficient while maintaining a desirable level of performance.},

abstract = {The ANSI X9.17/X9.31 pseudorandom number generator design was first standardized in 1985, with variants incorporated into numerous cryptographic standards over the next three decades. The design uses timestamps together with a statically keyed block cipher to produce pseudo-random output. It has been known since 1998 that the key must remain secret in order for the output to be secure. However, neither the FIPS 140-2 standardization process nor NIST's later descriptions of the algorithm specified any process for key generation. We performed a systematic study of publicly available FIPS 140- 2 certifications for hundreds of products that implemented the ANSI X9.31 random number generator, and found twelve whose certification documents use of static, hard-coded keys in source code, leaving the implementation vulnerable to an attacker who can learn this key from the source code or binary. In order to demonstrate the practicality of such an attack, we develop a full passive decryption attack against FortiGate VPN gateway products using FortiOS v4 that recovers the private key in seconds. We measure the prevalence of this vulnerability on the visible Internet using active scans, and demonstrate state recovery and full private key recovery in the wild. Our work highlights the extent to which the validation and certification process has failed to provide even modest security guarantees.},

abstract = {Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have gained primacy among the means of interacting with computing systems, thanks to the way they leverage human perceptual and motor capabilities. However, the design of GUIs has mostly been a manual activity. To design a GUI, the designer must select its visual, spatial, textual, and interaction properties such that the combination strikes a balance among the relevant human factors. While emerging computational-design techniques have addressed some problems related to grid layouts, no general approach has been proposed that can also produce good and complete results covering color-related decisions and other nonlinear design objectives. Evolutionary algorithms are promising and demonstrate good handling of similar problems in other conditions, genetic operators, depending on how they are designed. But even these approaches struggle with elements' overlap and hence produce too many infeasible candidate solutions. This paper presents a new approach based on grid-based genetic operators demonstrated in a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) setting. The operators use grid lines for element positions in a novel manner to satisfy overlap-related constraints and intrinsically improve the alignment of elements. This approach can be used for crossovers and mutations. Its core benefit is that all the solutions generated satisfy the no-overlap requirement and represent well-formed layouts. The new operators permit using genetic algorithms for increasingly realistic task instances, responding to more design objectives than could be considered before. Specifically, we address grid quality, alignment, selection time, clutter minimization, saliency control, color harmony, and grouping of elements.},

abstract = {Security is a critical aspect in many of the latest embedded and IoT systems. Malware is one of the severe threats of security for such devices. There have been enormous efforts in malware detection and analysis; however, occurrences of newer varieties of malicious codes prove that it is an extremely difficult problem given the nature of these surreptitious codes. In this article, instead of addressing a general solution, we aim at malware detection for platforms that have more than one core for performance enhancement. We investigate the utility of multiple cores from the point of view of security, where one of the cores operate as a watchdog. We define a notion of a new metric called LAMBDA (Lightweight Assessment of Malware for emBeddeD Architectures), denoted by λ, indicating a conceptual boundary between the programs which are allowed to run on a given platform, with the codes that are suspected as malwares. The metric λ is computed using carefully chosen monitors or features, which are tuples of high-level programs representing OS resources, along with low-level hardware performance counters. In comparison to heavy-weight machine learning techniques, we use an online hypothesis testing, in the form of t-test, to classify a given program-under-test. For applications where security is of prime concern, we propose an additional step based on multivariate analysis to classify the unknown programs that are closer to the threshold with a high degree of confidence. We present experimental results focusing on an ARM-based platform which validate that the proposed approach provides a lightweight, accurate assessment of malware codes for embedded platforms. In addition to it, we also present a security analysis to show the difficulty of a mimicry attack attempting to bypass LAMBDA.},

abstract = {Running off-site software middleboxes at third-party service providers has been a popular practice. However, routing large volumes of raw traffic, which may carry sensitive information, to a remote site for processing raises severe security concerns. Prior solutions often abstract away important factors pertinent to real-world deployment. In particular, they overlook the significance of metadata protection and stateful processing. Unprotected traffic metadata like low-level headers, size and count, can be exploited to learn supposedly encrypted application contents. Meanwhile, tracking the states of 100,000s of flows concurrently is often indispensable in production-level middleboxes deployed at real networks.We present LightBox, the first system that can drive off-site middleboxes at near-native speed with stateful processing and the most comprehensive protection to date. Built upon commodity trusted hardware, Intel SGX, LightBox is the product of our systematic investigation of how to overcome the inherent limitations of secure enclaves using domain knowledge and customization. First, we introduce an elegant virtual network interface that allows convenient access to fully protected packets at line rate without leaving the enclave, as if from the trusted source network. Second, we provide complete flow state management for efficient stateful processing, by tailoring a set of data structures and algorithms optimized for the highly constrained enclave space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that LightBox, with all security benefits, can achieve 10Gbps packet I/O, and that with case studies on three stateful middleboxes, it can operate at near-native speed.},

abstract = {Micro-architectural footprints can be used to distinguish one application from another. Most modern processors feature hardware performance counters to monitor the various micro-architectural events when an application is executing. These ready-made hardware performance counters can be used to create program fingerprints and have been shown to successfully differentiate between individual applications. In this paper, we demonstrate how ready-made hardware performance counters, due to their coarse-grain nature (low sampling rate and bundling of similar events, e.g., number of instructions instead of number of add instructions), are insufficient to this end. This observation motivates exploration of tailor-made hardware performance counters to capture fine-grain characteristics of the programs. As a case study, we evaluate both ready-made and tailor-made hardware performance counters using post-quantum cryptographic key encapsulation mechanism implementations. Machine learning models trained on tailor-made hardwareperformance counter streams demonstrate that they can uniquely identify the behavior of every post-quantum cryptographic key encapsulation mechanism algorithm with at least 98.99% accuracy.},

abstract = {A new development of smart-home systems is to use mobile apps to control IoT devices across a Home Area Network (HAN). As verified in our study, those systems tend to rely on the Wi-Fi router to authenticate other devices. This treatment exposes them to the attack from malicious apps, particularly those running on authorized phones, which the router does not have information to control. Mitigating this threat cannot solely rely on IoT manufacturers, which may need to change the hardware on the devices to support encryption, increasing the cost of the device, or software developers who we need to trust to implement security correctly. In this work, we present a new technique to control the communication between the IoT devices and their apps in a unified, backward-compatible way. Our approach, called HanGuard, does not require any changes to the IoT devices themselves, the IoT apps or the OS of the participating phones. HanGuard uses an SDN-like approach to offer fine-grained protection: each phone runs a non-system userspace Monitor app to identify the party that attempts to access the protected IoT device and inform the router through a control plane of its access decision; the router enforces the decision on the data plane after verifying whether the phone should be allowed to talk to the device. We implemented our design over both Android and iOS (&gt; 95% of mobile OS market share) and a popular router. Our study shows that HanGuard is both efficient and effective in practice.},

abstract = {Information security has been an area of research and teaching within various computing disciplines in higher education almost since the beginnings of modern computers. The need for security in computing curricula has steadily grown over this period. Recently, with an emerging global crisis, because of the limitations of security within the nascent information technology infrastructure, the field of "cybersecurity" is emerging with international interest and support. Recent evolution of cybersecurity shows that it has begun to take shape as a true academic perspective, as opposed to simply being a training domain for certain specialized jobs. This report starts from the premise that cybersecurity is a "meta-discipline." That is, cybersecurity is used as an aggregate label for a wide variety of similar disciplines, much in the same way that the terms "engineering" and "computing" are commonly used. Thus, cybersecurity should be formally interpreted as a meta-discipline with a variety of disciplinary variants, also characterized through a generic competency model. The intention is that this simple organizational concept will improve the clarity with which the field matures, resulting in improved standards and goals for many different types of cybersecurity programs.},

abstract = {Securely deleting obsolete data is of significant importance, as reserving them may not only endanger data owners' privacy, but also violate data protection regulations like GDPR, SOX and HIPPA. However, completely eliminating data is extremely challenging in modern computer systems. One reason is the past existence of the deleted data may leave artifacts in the layout of a storage system at all layers, and such structural artifacts may be utilized by the adversary to derive sensitive information about the data having been deleted. A novel security notion, history independence, can ensure that memory representation of a data structure is independent of the operation sequences leading to it. Therefore, history independence can be utilized to remove the structural artifacts created by the deleted data, making it possible to achieve secure deletion guarantee. In this work, leveraging history independence, we build history independent systems. The existing history independent file system (HIFS) suffers from a significant degradation compared to the regular file system, rendering it impractical for real-world applications. A fundamental reason for such a degradation is, HIFS simply re-locates the entire data in a history independent manner for each single write. This is unfortunately unnecessary since a multi-snapshot adversary has observed a previous snapshot, and relocating data appearing in this old snapshot is vain and incurs unnecessary overhead. This will be exacerbated when the file system load factor is large. We thus design eHIFS, the first efficient History Independent File System, in which we smartly take advantage of knowledge on the adversary's observations and eliminate those unnecessary re-locations. Security analysis and experimental evaluation show that, compared to HIFS, eHIFS can achieve a similar history independence guarantee, with a 33X write throughput improvement when the file system load factor is 90%.},

abstract = {The Tor anonymity network is often abused by attackers to (anonymously) convey attack traffic. These attacks abuse Tor exit relays (i.e., the relays through which traffic exits Tor) by making it appear the attack originates there; as a result, many website operators indiscriminately block all Tor traffic (by blacklisting all exit IPs), reducing the usefulness of Tor.Recent research shows that majority of these attacks are ones that generate high traffic volume (e.g., Denial-of-Service attacks). This suggests that a simple solution such as throttling traffic flow at the Tor exits may permit early detection of these attacks, improve overall reputation of exits, and eventually prevent blanket blocking of Tor exits. However, naively monitoring and throttling traffic at the Tor exits can endanger the privacy of the network's users.This paper introduces ZXAD (pronounced "zed-zad"), a zero-knowledge based private Tor exit abuse detection system that permits identification of otherwise unlinkable connections that are part of a high-volume attack. ZXAD does not reveal any information, apart from the fact that some user is conveying a high volume of traffic through Tor. We formally prove the correctness and security of ZXAD. We also measure two proof-of-concept implementations of our zero-knowledge proofs and show that ZXAD operates with low bandwidth and processing overheads.},

The currently dominant research direction focuses on on-device biometrics, which require sensitive information, such as images of a user's face, to be constantly streamed from a single recording source, often the device on which a user is getting authenticated. Instead, in this work we explore the possibilities offered by heterogeneous devices that opportunistically collect non-sensitive data in smart environments. We construct an IoT testbed in which we gather data pertaining to a person's movement in space, interaction with certain physical objects, PC terminal usage, and keyboard typing, and construct machine learning models capturing the person's behaviour traits. We commence our examination with models constructed from data sensed during a previously-completed task run and with such models we achieve up to 68% user identification accuracy (c.f. 7% baseline) among up to 20 individuals. Taking into account the limits of behaviour persistence we then revise our approach to continuously refine the model with the most recently sampled sensor data. This method allows us to achieve 99.3% user verification accuracy and successfully prevent a session takeover attack within 12 seconds with less than 1% of false attack detection.},

In this paper, we propose a timing-based side-channel to identify software versions running in co-resident VMs. The attack tests whether pages that are unique to a specific software version are present in co-resident VMs. We evaluate the attack in a setting without background load and in a more realistic setting with significant background load on the host memory. Our results indicate that, with few repetitions of our attack, we can precisely identify software versions within reasonable time frames and nearly independent of the background load. Finally, we discuss potential coun-termeasures against the presented side-channel attack.},

We model the systems under attack as hidden mode stochastic switched linear systems with unknown inputs and propose the use of a multiple-model inference algorithm to tackle these security issues. Moreover, we characterize fundamental limitations to resilient estimation (e.g., upper bound on the number of tolerable signal attacks) and discuss the topics of attack detection, identification, and mitigation under this framework. Simulation examples of switching and false data injection attacks on a benchmark system and an IEEE 68-bus test system show the efficacy of our approach to recover resilient (i.e., asymptotically unbiased) state estimates as well as to identify and mitigate the attacks.},

abstract = {Many computer-security defenses are reactive---they operate only when security incidents take place, or immediately thereafter. Recent efforts have attempted to predict security incidents before they occur, to enable defenders to proactively protect their devices and networks. These efforts have primarily focused on long-term predictions. We propose a system that enables proactive defenses at the level of a single browsing session. By observing user behavior, it can predict whether they will be exposed to malicious content on the web seconds before the moment of exposure, thus opening a window of opportunity for proactive defenses. We evaluate our system using three months' worth of HTTP traffic generated by 20,645 users of a large cellular provider in 2017 and show that it can be helpful, even when only very low false positive rates are acceptable, and despite the difficulty of making "on-the-fly'' predictions. We also engage directly with the users through surveys asking them demographic and security-related questions, to evaluate the utility of self-reported data for predicting exposure to malicious content. We find that self-reported data can help forecast exposure risk over long periods of time. However, even on the long-term, self-reported data is not as crucial as behavioral measurements to accurately predict exposure.},

abstract = {Emerging software defined network SDN stacks have introduced an entirely new attack surface that is exploitable from a wide range of launch points. Through an analysis of the various attack strategies reported in prior work, and through our own efforts to enumerate new and variant attack strategies, we have gained two insights. First, we observe that different SDN controller implementations, developed independently by different groups, seem to manifest common sets of pitfalls and design weakness that enable the extensive set of attacks compiled in this paper. Second, through a principled exploration of the underlying design and implementation weaknesses that enables these attacks, we introduce a taxonomy to offer insight into the common pitfalls that enable SDN stacks to be broken or destabilized when fielded within hostile computing environments. This paper first captures our understanding of the SDN attack surface through a comprehensive survey of existing SDN attack studies, which we extend by enumerating 12 new vectors for SDN abuse. We then organize these vulnerabilities within the well-known confidentiality, integrity, and availability model, assess the severity of these attacks by replicating them in a physical SDN testbed, and evaluate them against three popular SDN controllers. We also evaluate the impact of these attacks against published SDN defense solutions. Finally, we abstract our findings to offer the research and development communities with a deeper understanding of the common design and implementation pitfalls that are enabling the abuse of SDN networks.},

abstract = {Secure, fault-tolerant distributed systems are difficult to build, to validate, and to operate. Conservative design for such systems dictates that their security and fault tolerance depend on a very small number of assumptions taken on faith; such assumptions are typically called the "trusted computing base" (TCB) of a system. However, a rich trade-off exists between larger TCBs and more secure, more faulttolerant, or more efficient systems. In our recent work, we have explored this trade-off by defining "small," generic trusted primitives--for example, an attested, monotonically sequenced FIFO buffer of a few hundred machine words guaranteed to hold appended words until eviction and showing how such primitives can improve the performance, fault tolerance, and security of systems using them. In this article, we review our efforts in generating simple trusted primitives such as an attested circular buffer (called Attested Appendonly Memory), and an attested human activity detector. We describe the benefits of using these primitives to increase the fault-tolerance of replicated systems and archival storage, and to improve the security of email SPAM and click-fraud prevention systems. Finally, we share some lessons we have learned from this endeavor.},

The vision of automatically screening cryptographic API calls in massive-sized (e.g., millions of LoC) programs is not new. However, hindered by the practical difficulty of reducing false positives without compromising analysis quality, this goal has not been accomplished. CryptoGuard is a set of detection algorithms that refine program slices by identifying language-specific irrelevant elements. The refinements reduce false alerts by 76% to 80% in our experiments. Running our tool, CryptoGuard, on 46 high-impact large-scale Apache projects and 6,181 Android apps generated many security insights. Our findings helped multiple popular Apache projects to harden their code, including Spark, Ranger, and Ofbiz. We also have made progress towards the science of analysis in this space, including manually analyzing 1,295 Apache alerts, confirming 1,277 true positives (98.61% precision), and in-depth comparison with leading solutions including CrySL, SpotBugs, and Coverity.},

abstract = {Despite surveillance systems becoming increasingly ubiquitous in our living environment, automated surveillance, currently based on video sensory modality and machine intelligence, lacks most of the time the robustness and reliability required in several real applications. To tackle this issue, audio sensory devices have been incorporated, both alone or in combination with video, giving birth in the past decade, to a considerable amount of research. In this article, audio-based automated surveillance methods are organized into a comprehensive survey: A general taxonomy, inspired by the more widespread video surveillance field, is proposed to systematically describe the methods covering background subtraction, event classification, object tracking, and situation analysis. For each of these tasks, all the significant works are reviewed, detailing their pros and cons and the context for which they have been proposed. Moreover, a specific section is devoted to audio features, discussing their expressiveness and their employment in the above-described tasks. Differing from other surveys on audio processing and analysis, the present one is specifically targeted to automated surveillance, highlighting the target applications of each described method and providing the reader with a systematic and schematic view useful for retrieving the most suited algorithms for each specific requirement.},

abstract = {We present efficient algorithms for releasing useful statistics about graph data while providing rigorous privacy guarantees. Our algorithms work on datasets that consist of relationships between individuals, such as social ties or email communication. The algorithms satisfy edge differential privacy, which essentially requires that the presence or absence of any particular relationship be hidden.Our algorithms output approximate answers to subgraph counting queries. Given a query graph H, for example, a triangle, k-star, or k-triangle, the goal is to return the number of edge-induced isomorphic copies of H in the input graph. The special case of triangles was considered by Nissim et al. [2007] and a more general investigation of arbitrary query graphs was initiated by Rastogi et al. [2009]. We extend the approach of Nissim et al. to a new class of statistics, namely k-star queries. We also give algorithms for k-triangle queries using a different approach based on the higher-order local sensitivity. For the specific graph statistics we consider (i.e., k-stars and k-triangles), we significantly improve on the work of Rastogi et al.: our algorithms satisfy a stronger notion of privacy that does not rely on the adversary having a particular prior distribution on the data, and add less noise to the answers before releasing them.We evaluate the accuracy of our algorithms both theoretically and empirically, using a variety of real and synthetic datasets. We give explicit, simple conditions under which these algorithms add a small amount of noise. We also provide the average-case analysis in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi-Gilbert G(n,p) random graph model.Finally, we give hardness results indicating that the approach Nissim et al. used for triangles cannot easily be extended to k-triangles (hence justifying our development of a new algorithmic approach).},

abstract = {Smart factories, critical infrastructures, and medical devices largely rely on embedded systems that need to satisfy realtime constraints to complete crucial tasks. Recent studies and reports have revealed that many of these devices suffer from crucial vulnerabilities that can be exploited with fatal consequences. Despite the security and safety-critical role of these devices, they often do not feature state-of-the-art security mechanisms. Moreover, since realtime systems have strict timing requirements, integrating new security mechanisms is not a viable option as they often influence the device's runtime behavior. One solution is to offload security enhancements to a remote instance, the so-called remote attestation.We present RealSWATT, the first software-based remote attestation system for realtime embedded devices. Remote attestation is a powerful security service that allows a party to verify the correct functionality of an untrusted remote device. In contrast to previous remote attestation approaches for realtime systems, RealSWATT does neither require custom hardware extensions nor trusted computing components. It is designed to work within real-world IoT networks, connected through Wi-Fi. RealSWATT leverages a dedicated processor core for remote attestation and provides the required timing guarantees without hardware extensions. We implement RealSWATT on the popular ESP32 microcontroller, and we evaluate it on a real-world medical device with realtime constraints. To demonstrate its applicability, we furthermore integrate RealSWATT into a framework for off-the-shelf IoT devices and apply it to a smart plug, a smoke detector, and a smart light bulb.},

abstract = {The dynamic nature of the cloud environment has made the distributed resource management process a challenge for cloud service providers. The importance of maintaining quality of service in accordance with customer expectations and the highly dynamic nature of cloud-hosted applications add new levels of complexity to the process. Advances in big-data learning approaches have shifted conventional static capacity planning solutions to complex performance-aware resource management methods. It is shown that the process of decision-making for resource adjustment is closely related to the behavior of the system, including the utilization of resources and application components. Therefore, a continuous monitoring of system attributes and performance metrics provides the raw data for the analysis of problems affecting the performance of the application. Data analytic methods, such as statistical and machine-learning approaches, offer the required concepts, models, and tools to dig into the data and find general rules, patterns, and characteristics that define the functionality of the system. Obtained knowledge from the data analysis process helps to determine the changes in the workloads, faulty components, or problems that can cause system performance to degrade. A timely reaction to performance degradation can avoid violations of service level agreements, including performing proper corrective actions such as auto-scaling or other resource adjustment solutions. In this article, we investigate the main requirements and limitations of cloud resource management, including a study of the approaches to workload and anomaly analysis in the context of performance management in the cloud. A taxonomy of the works on this problem is presented that identifies main approaches in existing research from the data analysis side to resource adjustment techniques. Finally, considering the observed gaps in the general direction of the reviewed works, a list of these gaps is proposed for future researchers to pursue.},

We offer two privacy-preserving configurations of our solution, one limited to crash failures and supporting a basic kind of aggregation; the second supporting a wider range of queries and also tolerating Byzantine behavior by compromised nodes. The former is quite fast and scalable, the latter more robust against attack and capable of offering full differential privacy for an important class of queries, but it costs more and injects noise that makes the query results slightly inaccurate. Other configurations are also possible. At the core of our approach is a new kind of overlay network (a superimposed routing structure operated by the endpoint devices). This overlay is optimally robust and convergent, and our protocols use it both for aggregation and as a general-purpose infrastructure for peer-to-peer communications.},

abstract = {Data integration methods enable different data providers to flexibly integrate their expertise and deliver highly customizable services to their customers. Nonetheless, combining data from different sources could potentially reveal person-specific sensitive information. In VLDBJ 2006, Jiang and Clifton (Very Large Data Bases J (VLDBJ) 15(4):316---333, 2006) propose a secure Distributed k-Anonymity (DkA) framework for integrating two private data tables to a k-anonymous table in which each private table is a vertical partition on the same set of records. Their proposed DkA framework is not scalable to large data sets. Moreover, DkA is limited to a two-party scenario and the parties are assumed to be semi-honest. In this paper, we propose two algorithms to securely integrate private data from multiple parties (data providers). Our first algorithm achieves the k-anonymity privacy model in a semi-honest adversary model. Our second algorithm employs a game-theoretic approach to thwart malicious participants and to ensure fair and honest participation of multiple data providers in the data integration process. Moreover, we study and resolve a real-life privacy problem in data sharing for the financial industry in Sweden. Experiments on the real-life data demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can effectively retain the essential information in anonymous data for data analysis and are scalable for anonymizing large data sets.},

abstract = {Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is the problem of recovering the underlying reward function from the behavior of an expert. Most of the existing IRL algorithms assume that the environment is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), although it is desirable to handle partially observable settings in order to handle more realistic scenarios. In this paper, we present IRL algorithms for partially observable environments that can be modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We deal with two cases according to the representation of the given expert's behavior, namely the case in which the expert's policy is explicitly given, and the case in which the expert's trajectories are available instead. The IRL in POMDPs poses a greater challenge than in MDPs since it is not only ill-posed due to the nature of IRL, but also computationally intractable due to the hardness in solving POMDPs. To overcome these obstacles, we present algorithms that exploit some of the classical results from the POMDP literature. Experimental results on several benchmark POMDP domains show that our work is useful for partially observable settings.},

abstract = {As human activities have moved to the digital domain, so have all the well-known malicious behaviors including fraud, theft, and other trickery. There is no silver bullet, and each security threat calls for a specific answer. One particular threat is that applications accept malformed inputs, and in many cases it is possible to craft inputs that let an intruder take full control over the target computer system.The nature of systems programming languages lies at the heart of the problem. Rather than rewriting decades of well-tested functionality, this book examines ways to live with the (programming) sins of the past while shoring up security in the most efficient manner possible. We explore a range of different options, each making significant progress toward securing legacy programs from malicious inputs.The solutions explored include enforcement-type defenses, which exclude certain program executions because they never arise during normal operation. Another strand explores the idea of presenting adversaries with a moving target that unpredictably changes its attack surface thanks to randomization. We also cover tandem execution ideas where the compromise of one executing clone causes it to diverge from another, thus revealing adversarial activities. }

abstract = {Welcome to SIGMOD 2015 -- officially, the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on the Management of Data! This year's conference is being held in the beautiful cultural capital of Australia, Melbourne. During the Gold Rush period of the 19th Century, Melbourne was the richest city in the world, and as a result it is filled with many unique neighborhoods and distinctive buildings. In addition to wonderful neighborhoods to explore, the city has great museums and other cultural attractions, as well as a fine multi-cultural atmosphere. For those who would like to explore the outdoors, popular highlights are the Phillip Island Nature Park (90 minutes away), which features wild penguins who return in a parade each day at sunset, and the Great Ocean Road, one of the world's most scenic coastal drives, including the famous towering 12 Apostles.SIGMOD 2015's exciting technical program reflects not only traditional topics, but the database community's role in broader data science and data analytics. The keynote from Laura Haas, "The Power Behind the Throne: Information Integration in the Age of Data-Driven Discovery" highlights the role of database and data integration techniques in the growing field of data science. Jignesh Patel's talk, "From Data to Insights @ Bare Metal Speed," explains how hardware and software need to be co-evolved to support the needs of scalable data analytics. Jennifer Widom, winner of the 2015 ACM-W Athena Lecturer Award for fundamental contributions to computer science, will give her award talk, "Three Favorite Results," on Tuesday. Christopher R\'{e} will lead a panel on "Machine Learning and Databases: The Sound of Things to Come or a Cacophony of Hype?," with participants Divyakant Agrawal, Magdalena Balazinska, Michael Cafarella, Michael Jordan, Tim Kraska, and Raghu Ramakrishnan. Of course, there are also 106 research paper presentations, 4 tutorials, 30 demonstrations, and 18 industrial papers. Papers will be presented both as talks during the research sessions, and as part of plenary Poster Sessions.SIGMOD 2015 is preceded by the PhD Workshop, as well as workshops on leading-edge topics like data analytics (DanaC), databases and the Web (WebDB), exploratory search (ExploreDB), managing and mining spatial data (GeoRich), and graph data (GRADES); the New Researcher Symposium will take place on Wednesday. The banquet will be held in a Melbourne landmark, the Town Hall.As in recent years, we had two submission deadlines for SIGMOD this year, one in August and one in November. The review process was journal-style, with multiple rounds of reviews coordinated by the Group Leaders. We accepted 34 of 137 papers from the first deadline and 72 of 278 from the second deadline. The total acceptance rate was about 25.5%, and we believe that the revision processhas improved the quality of the technical program.},

abstract = {The authors introduce the Bronte machine learning evaluation study for consistent detection of malware, specifically honed for botnets. Machine learning algorithms are already being used to detect malware in dynamic environments. This evaluation utilizes a static measurement approach that could be implemented on edge network devices. It was generated from conversation-based network traffic. This study fully enumerated the network traffic features to allow various machine learning algorithms to build various training sets to deploy against dual test sets. Utilizing the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) datamining and analysis tool, various algorithmic experiments were deployed against the modern and large CICIDS2017 dataset. This evaluation study aimed to push non-IP address features through a series of machine learning classifiers. The study was conducted differently and more methodically than other related studies by using three highly randomized training sets and two test data sets. The test sets were different in that one was a real world based 98.9 benign traffic and one was 50/50 benign to bot traffic. The instance based nearest neighbor and decision tree classifiers ranked highest only using the training sets; but the J48, an expanded ID3 decision tree classifier, clearly produced the highest predictions against both test sets.},

abstract = {Cybersecurity adopts data mining for its ability to extract concealed and indistinct patterns in the data, such as for the needs of alert correlation. Inferring common attack patterns and rules from the alerts helps in understanding the threat landscape for the defenders and allows for the realization of cyber situational awareness, including the projection of ongoing attacks. In this article, we explore the use of data mining, namely sequential rule mining, in the analysis of intrusion detection alerts. We employed a dataset of 12 million alerts from 34 intrusion detection systems in 3 organizations gathered in an alert sharing platform, and processed it using our analytical framework. We execute the mining of sequential rules that we use to predict security events, which we utilize to create a predictive blacklist. Thus, the recipients of the data from the sharing platform will receive only a small number of alerts of events that are likely to occur instead of a large number of alerts of past events. The predictive blacklist has the size of only 3% of the raw data, and more than 60% of its entries are shown to be successful in performing accurate predictions in operational, real-world settings.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection algorithms aim at identifying unexpected fluctuations in the expected behavior of target indicators, and, when applied to intrusion detection, suspect attacks whenever the above deviations are observed. Through years, several of such algorithms have been proposed, evaluated experimentally, and analyzed in qualitative and quantitative surveys. However, the experimental comparison of a comprehensive set of algorithms for anomaly-based intrusion detection against a comprehensive set of attacks datasets and attack types was not investigated yet. To fill such gap, in this paper we experimentally evaluate a pool of twelve unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms on five attacks datasets. Results allow elaborating on a wide range of arguments, from the behavior of the individual algorithm to the suitability of the datasets to anomaly detection. We identify the families of algorithms that are more effective for intrusion detection, and the families that are more robust to the choice of configuration parameters. Further, we confirm experimentally that attacks with unstable and non-repeatable behavior are more difficult to detect, and that datasets where anomalies are rare events usually result in better detection scores.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are often network integrated to enable remote management, monitoring, and reporting. Such integration has made them vulnerable to cyber attacks originating from an untrusted network (e.g., the internet). Once an attacker breaches the network security, he could corrupt operations of the system in question, which may in turn lead to catastrophes. Hence there is a critical need to detect intrusions into mission-critical CPS. Signature based detection may not work well for CPS, whose complexity may preclude any succinct signatures that we will need. Specification based detection requires accurate definitions of system behaviour that similarly can be hard to obtain, due to the CPS's complexity and dynamics, as well as inaccuracies and incompleteness of design documents or operation manuals. Formal models, to be tractable, are often oversimplified, in which case they will not support effective detection. In this paper, we study a behaviour-based machine learning (ML) approach for the intrusion detection. Whereas prior unsupervised ML methods have suffered from high missed detection or false-positive rates, we use a high-fidelity CPS testbed, which replicates all main physical and control components of a modern water treatment facility, to generate systematic training data for a supervised method. The method does not only detect the occurrence of a cyber attack at the physical process layer, but it also identifies the specific type of the attack. Its detection is fast and robust to noise. Furthermore, its adaptive system model can learn quickly to match dynamics of the CPS and its operating environment. It exhibits a low false positive (FP) rate, yet high precision and recall.},

abstract = {Machine learning approaches have been increasingly applied to various applications for data analytics (e.g. spam filtering, image classification). Further, with the growing adoption of cloud computing, various cloud services have provided an efficient way for users to train, store or deploy machine learning algorithms in an easy-to-use manner. However, the models deployed in the cloud may be exposed to potential malicious attacks launched at the server side. Attackers with access to the server can stealthily manipulate a machine learning model so as to enable misclassification or introduce bias. In this work, we study the problem of manipulation attacks as they occur at the server side. We consider not only traditional supervised learning models but also state-of-the-art deep learning models. In particular, a simple but effective gradient descent based approach is presented to exploit Logistic Regression (LR) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) [16] models. We evaluate manipulation attacks against machine learning or deep learning systems using both Enron email text and MINIST image dataset [17]. Experimental results have demonstrated such attacks can manipulate the model that allows malicious samples to evade detection easily without compromising the overall performance of the systems.},

abstract = {Various classifiers based on the machine learning techniques have been widely used in security applications. Meanwhile, they also became an attack target of adversaries. Many existing studies have paid much attention to the evasion attacks on the online classifiers and discussed defensive methods. However, the security of the classifiers deployed in the client environment has not got the attention it deserves. Besides, earlier studies only concentrated on the experimental classifiers developed for research purposes only. The security of widely-used commercial classifiers still remains unclear. In this paper, we use the Google's phishing pages filter (GPPF), a classifier deployed in the Chrome browser which owns over one billion users, as a case to investigate the security challenges for the client-side classifiers. We present a new attack methodology targeting on client-side classifiers, called classifiers cracking. With the methodology, we successfully cracked the classification model of GPPF and extracted sufficient knowledge can be exploited for evasion attacks, including the classification algorithm, scoring rules and features, etc. Most importantly, we completely reverse engineered 84.8% scoring rules, covering most of high-weighted rules. Based on the cracked information, we performed two kinds of evasion attacks to GPPF, using 100 real phishing pages for the evaluation purpose. The experiments show that all the phishing pages (100%) can be easily manipulated to bypass the detection of GPPF. Our study demonstrates that the existing client-side classifiers are very vulnerable to classifiers cracking attacks.},

abstract = {The Controller Area Network (CAN) is a bus standard commonly used in the automotive industry for connecting Electronic Control Units (ECUs) within a vehicle. The broadcast nature of this protocol, along with the lack of authentication or strong integrity guarantees for frames, allows for arbitrary data injection/modification and impersonation of the ECUs. While mitigation strategies have been proposed to counter these attacks, high implementation costs or violation of backward compatibility hinder their deployment. In this work, we first examine the shortcomings of state-of-the-art CAN intrusion detection and identification systems that rely on multiple frames to detect misbehavior and attribute it to a particular ECU, and show that they are vulnerable to a Hill-Climbing-style attack. Then we propose SIMPLE, a real-time intrusion detection and identification system that exploits physical layer features of ECUs, which would not only allow an attack to be detected using a single frame but also be effectively nullified. SIMPLE has low computational and data acquisition costs, and its efficacy is demonstrated by both in-lab experiments with automotive-grade CAN transceivers as well as in-vehicle experiments, where average equal error rates of close to 0% and 0.8985% are achieved, respectively.},

abstract = {Exploit kits are software toolkits that are used for widespread malware distribution via automated infection of victims' computers through Internet web pages. They are extremely hard to detect as they constantly evolve by frequently changing the hosted domains and URL patterns which draws any signature-based detection ineffective.In this paper we analyse common exploit kit characteristics and propose a detection method that relies solely on the information extracted from HTTP proxy logs that are commonly available in most enterprise networks. Our method leverages exploit kit characteristics that are common across different exploit kit families and are unlikely to change as they are crucial for the exploitation process.We perform two sets of experiments to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method. The first set uses network traces of a number of publicly available malicious samples to estimate recall of the proposed method. Second set of experiments uses real network traffic collected in large number of corporate networks to estimate the precision. Both sets of experiments show satisfying performance of the algorithm.},

abstract = {While machine learning has proven to be promising in several application domains, our understanding of its behavior and limitations is still in its nascent stages. One such domain is that of cybersecurity, where machine learning models are replacing traditional rule based systems, owing to their ability to generalize and deal with large scale attacks which are not seen before. However, the naive transfer of machine learning principles to the domain of security needs to be taken with caution. Machine learning was not designed with security in mind and as such is prone to adversarial manipulation and reverse engineering. While most data based learning models rely on a static assumption of the world, the security landscape is one that is especially dynamic, with an ongoing never ending arms race between the system designer and the attackers. Any solution designed for such a domain needs to take into account an active adversary and needs to evolve over time, in the face of emerging threats. We term this as the "Dynamic Adversarial Mining" problem, and this paper provides motivation and foundation for this new interdisciplinary area of research, at the crossroads of machine learning, cybersecurity, and streaming data mining.},

abstract = {Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) can be evaded by carefully crafted packets that exploit implementation-level discrepancies between how they are processed on the NIDS and at the endhosts. These discrepancies arise due to the plethora of endhost implementations and evolutions thereof. It is prohibitive to proactively employ a large set of implementations at the NIDS and check incoming packets against all of those. Hence, NIDS typically choose simplified implementations that attempt to approximate and generalize across the different endhost implementations. Unfortunately, this solution is fundamentally flawed since such approximations are bound to have discrepancies with some endhost implementations. In this paper, we develop a lightweight system Themis, which empowers the NIDS in identifying these discrepancies and reactively forking its connection states when any packets with "ambiguities" are encountered. Specifically, Themis incorporates an offline phase in which it extracts models from various popular implementations using symbolic execution. During runtime, it maintains a nondeterministic finite automaton to keep track of the states for each possible implementation. Our extensive evaluations show that Themis is extremely effective and can detect all evasion attacks known to date, while consuming extremely low overhead. En route, we also discovered multiple previously unknown discrepancies that can be exploited to bypass current NIDS.},

abstract = {Real-time network- and host-based Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs) transform a continuous stream of input data into meaningful and quantifiable anomaly scores. These scores are subsequently compared to a fixed detection threshold and classified as either benign or malicious. We argue that a real-time ADS’ input changes considerably over time and a fixed threshold value cannot guarantee good anomaly detection accuracy for such a time-varying input. In this article, we propose a simple and generic technique to adaptively tune the detection threshold of any ADS that works on threshold method. To this end, we first perform statistical and information-theoretic analysis of network- and host-based ADSs’ anomaly scores to reveal a consistent time correlation structure during benign activity periods. We model the observed correlation structure using Markov chains, which are in turn used in a stochastic target tracking framework to adapt an ADS’ detection threshold in accordance with real-time measurements. We also use statistical techniques to make the proposed algorithm resilient to sporadic changes and evasion attacks. In order to evaluate the proposed approach, we incorporate the proposed adaptive thresholding module into multiple ADSs and evaluate those ADSs over comprehensive and independently collected network and host attack datasets. We show that, while reducing the need of human threshold configuration, the proposed technique provides considerable and consistent accuracy improvements for all evaluated ADSs.},

To this end, we introduce a new propagation model based on the interactions between an adversary (and its agents) who wishes to construct a zombie army of a specific size, and a defender taking advantage of standard security tools and technologies such as honeypots (HPs) and intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSes) in the network environment. As time goes on, the defender can incrementally learn from the collected/observed attack samples (e.g., malware payloads), and therefore being able to generate attack signatures. The generated signatures then are used for filtering next attack traffic and thus containing the attacker's progress in its malware propagation mission. Using simulation and numerical analysis, we evaluate the efficacy of signature generation algorithms and in general any learning-based scheme in bringing an adversary's maneuvering in the environment to a halt as an adversarial containment strategy.},

abstract = {Increased connectivity increases the attack vector. This also applies to connected vehicles in which vulnerabilities not only threaten digital values but also humans and the environment. Typically, attackers try to exploit the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, which is the most widely used standard for internal vehicle communication. Once an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) connected to the CAN bus is compromised, attackers can manipulate messages at will. The missing sender authentication by design of the CAN bus enables adversarial access to vehicle functions with severe consequences. In order to address this problem, we propose Scission, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which uses fingerprints extracted from CAN frames, enabling the identification of sending ECUs. Scission utilizes physical characteristics from analog values of CAN frames to assess whether it was sent by the legitimate ECU. In addition, to detect comprised ECUs, the proposed system is able to recognize attacks from unmonitored and additional devices. We show that Scission is able to identify the sender with an average probability of 99.85%, during the evaluation on two series production cars and a prototype setup. Due to the robust design of the system, the evaluation shows that all false positives were prevented. Compared to previous approaches, we have significantly reduced hardware costs and increased identification rates, which enables a broad application of this technology.},

abstract = { Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is an important tool for network administrators to detect security breaches in a network. However, due to the diversity of attacks and imbalanced datasets having less number of data pertinent to attack events, current machine learning based NIDS applications often do not perform well. Therefore, it is important to synthesize data in a probabilistic manner that is similar to original attack event related data. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a new paradigm of the synthesizing task based on Variational Laplace AutoEncoder (VLAE) and Deep Neural Network, and exploit the paradigm to develop a new intrusion detection model. Here, we go beyond the existing VLAE model through incorporating class labels as an input. We term the enhanced model as Conditional Variational Laplace AutoEncoder (CVLAE). We employ the CVLAE to learn latent variable representations of network data features and to synthesize data in a probabilistic manner. We use a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier, trained on the original and synthesized data, and classify the attack samples. We evaluate our model on the benchmark NSL-KDD dataset. We demonstrate efficacy of our proposed model through showing that our method achieve higher precision in minority attacks than other methods in our experimentation.},

abstract = {State of the art deep learning techniques are known to be vulnerable to evasion attacks where an adversarial sample is generated from a malign sample and misclassified as benign. Detection of encrypted malware command and control traffic based on TCP/IP flow features can be framed as a learning task and is thus vulnerable to evasion attacks. However, unlike e.g. in image processing where generated adversarial samples can be directly mapped to images, going from flow features to actual TCP/IP packets requires crafting the sequence of packets, with no established approach for such crafting and a limitation on the set of modifiable features that such crafting allows.In this paper we discuss learning and evasion consequences of the gap between generated and crafted adversarial samples. We exemplify with a deep neural network detector trained on a public C2 traffic dataset, white-box adversarial learning, and a proxy-based approach for crafting longer flows. Our results show 1) the high evasion rate obtained by using generated adversarial samples on the detector can be significantly reduced when using crafted adversarial samples; 2) robustness against adversarial samples by model hardening varies according to the crafting approach and corresponding set of modifiable features that the attack allows for; 3) incrementally training hardened models with adversarial samples can produce a level playing field where no detector is best against all attacks and no attack is best against all detectors, in a given set of attacks and detectors. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that level playing field feature set- and iteration-hardening are analyzed in encrypted C2 malware traffic detection.},

abstract = {Increasingly mature, stealthy and dynamic techniques and attack vectors used by cyber criminals have made network infrastructure more vulnerable to security breaches. Moreover, cyber-attacks involving advanced evasion techniques often bypass security controls, and even if detected at a later time could still remain in the system for a long time without any monitorable trace. Such types of cyber-attacks are costing billions of dollars to the organizations across the globe. This dynamic and complex threat landscape demands a network administrator to understand the nature, patterns and risks of cyber-attacks targeting the network infrastructure so that appropriate measures could be introduced. In this paper we propose: (i) a framework to formally characterize the features of such advanced persistent threats, (ii) propose a security metric to calculate risk based on characteristics of such threats, and (iii) estimate risk boundaries for persistent and stealthy cyber-attacks. We validate and analyze the application of our proposed risk framework using real-world traffic logs acquired from an Intrusion Detection/Prevention System.},

The main aim of the present work is the development of a tool based on a previous behaviour study of security audit tools (oriented to SQL pentesting) with the purpose of creating testing sets capable of performing an accurate detection of a SQL attack. The study is based on the information collected through the generated web server logs in a pentesting laboratory environment. Then, making use of the common extracted patterns from the logs, each attack vector has been classified in risk levels (dangerous attack, normal attack, non-attack, etc.). Finally, a training with the generated data was performed in order to obtain a classifier system that has a variable performance between 97 and 99 percent in positive attack detection. The training data is shared to other servers in order to create a distributed network capable of deciding if a query is an attack or is a real petition and inform to connected clients in order to block the petitions from the attacker's IP.},

Many data plane systems have been proposed for handling network dynamics (e.g., congestion, failures) in near real-time. The core of these systems has packet-processing data-plane algorithms that continuously monitor traffic and respond automatically. Despite their benefits, automatic response to network events lead to increase in potential sources of inputs, and hence, increase in attack surface.This paper takes a step towards securing such systems by (1) identifying possible attacks on recently proposed data-driven data-plane systems; and (2) designing a scalable tool for detecting such attacks at run time. Our approach models plausible expected behavior and uses the model as a reference to check whether the system is under attack. We conduct preliminary experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of our detection methodology.},

Here attack graphs method is used for predicting the various ways of penetrating a network to reach its critical assets. In particular, automated analysis of network configuration and attacker exploits provides an attack graph showing all possible paths to critical assets. The aim is to implement Reconciliation engine for identifying the various critical vulnerabilities and a metric system for identifying the overall impact of the vulnerabilities in that network. The reconciliation process is done by analysing the results obtained from different vulnerability scanners and combining them. As part of this, vulnerability tools from commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), Government off-the-shelf (GOTS), and research laboratory were selected. The automatic extraction of vulnerability information for attack graph prediction is analysed. Vulnerability information describes what is required for a vulnerability to be exploited and what are the after effects of that exploitation. A data structure is analysed which is able to represent pre and post conditions of each vulnerabilities. The combined risk assessment provides a readily comprehensible picture of the risk posture, assisting the analyst in the definition of an acceptable risk posture for an operational system or preliminary system design. We would be finding a metric value for denoting the overall vulnerability of the network after analysing critical vulnerabilities.},

Evidently, these techniques are intended to be connected to the control flow to be able to acquire and analyze the necessary measurement data, which makes them susceptible to compromise by the attacker. In this paper, we approach process-level attack detection from a side-channel perspective, where we investigate the feasibility and efficacy of monitoring industrial machines through external sensors.

abstract = {Many organizations today use a variety of security and monitoring tools at various levels of defense. These tools often generate heterogeneous alerts and logs when an attack occurs. Because of the large volume and dispersion of these alerts and logs, the manual cross-correlation of them is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. The main challenge is that heterogeneous alerts and logs generated as a result of an attack stage do not necessarily have common features, or there are no explicit relationships between them that can be used for cross-correlation. In this paper, we overcome this deficiency by presenting HAL-RD, a novel technique that uses resource dependencies to cross-correlate heterogeneous alerts and logs. In this technique, we track logs for backward and forward dependencies between resources. This information is then used to construct an attack state graph, which is a directed graph whose nodes represent attack states and whose directed edges represent the chronological ordering between them. Each attack state integrates information found in multiple heterogeneous alerts, logs, and OS-level operations, which relate to one stage in a multi-stage attack. In certain circumstances, the attack state graph is incrementally updated. By doing this, when an attacker continues his/her multi-stage attack after a delay, all of his/her activities are identified. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of HAL-RD for cross-correlating heterogeneous alerts and logs.},

Its main drawback is that the creation of specifications often require human intervention. We present the first fully automated approach to deploy SB-ID at network level. We do so in the domain of BASs, specifically, the BACnet protocol (ISO 16484-5). In this protocol, properly certified devices are demanded to have technical documentation stating their capabilities. We leverage on those documents to create specifications that represent the expected behavior of each device in the network. Automated specification extraction is crucial to effectively apply SB-ID in volatile environments such as BACnet networks, where new devices are often added, removed, or replaced. In our experiments, the proposed algorithm creates specifications with both precision and recall above 99.5%. Finally, we evaluate the capabilities of our detection approach using two months (80GB) of BACnet traffic from a real BAS. Additionally, we use synthetic traffic to demonstrate attack detection in a controlled environment. We show that our approach not only contributes to the practical feasibility of SB-ID in BASs, but also detects stealthy and dangerous attacks.},

Our analysis identifies three main methodological areas (machine learning, deep learning, statistical approaches) and summarizes how exactly the corresponding models are applied for the detection of anomalies. Furthermore, we clarify which concrete application areas are typically addressed by anomaly detection in the context of cloud computing environments and which related public datasets are often used for evaluations. Finally, we discuss the implications of the literature review and provide directions for future research.},

abstract = {Today, human security analysts need to sift through large volumes of alerts they have to triage during investigations. This alert fatigue results in failure to detect complex attacks, such as advanced persistent threats (APTs), because they manifest over long time frames and attackers tread carefully to evade detection mechanisms. In this paper, we contribute a new method to synthesize scenario graphs from state machines. We use the network direction to derive potential attack stages from single and meta-alerts and model resulting attack scenarios in a kill chain state machine(KCSM). Our algorithm yields a graphical summary of the attack, called APT scenario graphs, where nodes represent involved hosts and edges infection activity. We evaluate the feasibility of our approach by injecting an APT campaign into a network traffic data set containing both benign and malicious activity. Our approach then generates a set of APT scenario graphs that contain our injected campaign while reducing the overall alert set by up to three orders of magnitude. This reduction makes it feasible for human analysts to effectively triage potential incidents.},

abstract = {Context: Research at the intersection of cybersecurity, Machine Learning (ML), and Software Engineering (SE) has recently taken significant steps in proposing countermeasures for detecting sophisticated data exfiltration attacks. It is important to systematically review and synthesize the ML-based data exfiltration countermeasures for building a body of knowledge on this important topic. Objective: This article aims at systematically reviewing ML-based data exfiltration countermeasures to identify and classify ML approaches, feature engineering techniques, evaluation datasets, and performance metrics used for these countermeasures. This review also aims at identifying gaps in research on ML-based data exfiltration countermeasures. Method: We used Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method to select and review 92 papers. Results: The review has enabled us to: (a) classify the ML approaches used in the countermeasures into data-driven, and behavior-driven approaches; (b) categorize features into six types: behavioral, content-based, statistical, syntactical, spatial, and temporal; (c) classify the evaluation datasets into simulated, synthesized, and real datasets; and (d) identify 11 performance measures used by these studies. Conclusion: We conclude that: (i) The integration of data-driven and behavior-driven approaches should be explored; (ii) There is a need of developing high quality and large size evaluation datasets; (iii) Incremental ML model training should be incorporated in countermeasures; (iv) Resilience to adversarial learning should be considered and explored during the development of countermeasures to avoid poisoning attacks; and (v) The use of automated feature engineering should be encouraged for efficiently detecting data exfiltration attacks.},

abstract = {We propose a new security paradigm that makes cross-layer personalization a premier component in the design of security solutions for computer infrastructure and situational awareness. This paradigm is based on the observation that computer systems have a personalized usage profile that depends on the user and his activities. Further, it spans the various layers of abstraction that make up a computer system, as if the user embedded his own DNA into the computer system. To realize such a paradigm, we discuss the design of a comprehensive and cross-layer profiling approach, which can be adopted to boost the effectiveness of various security solutions, e.g., malware detection, insider attacker prevention and continuous authentication. The current state-of-the-art in computer infrastructure defense solutions focuses on one layer of operation with deployments coming in a "one size fits all" format, without taking into account the unique way people use their computers. The key novelty of our proposal is the cross-layer personalization, where we derive the distinguishable behaviors from the intelligence of three layers of abstraction. First, we combine intelligence from: a) the user layer, (e.g., mouse click patterns); b) the operating system layer; c) the network layer. Second, we develop cross-layer personalized profiles for system usage. We will limit our scope to companies and organizations, where computers are used in a more routine and one-on-one style, before we expand our research to personally owned computers. Our preliminary results show that just the time accesses in user web logs are already sufficient to distinguish users from each other,with users of the same demographics showing similarities in their profiles. Our goal is to challenge today's paradigm for anomaly detection that seems to follow a monoculture and treat each layer in isolation. We also discuss deployment, performance overhead, and privacy issues raised by our paradigm.},

abstract = {In recent years, enterprises have been targeted by advanced adversaries who leverage creative ways to infiltrate their systems and move laterally to gain access to critical data. One increasingly common evasive method is to hide the malicious activity behind a benign program by using tools that are already installed on user computers. These programs are usually part of the operating system distribution or another user-installed binary, therefore this type of attack is called “Living-Off-The-Land”. Detecting these attacks is challenging, as adversaries may not create malicious files on the victim computers and anti-virus scans fail to detect them. We propose the design of an Active Learning framework called LOLAL for detecting Living-Off-the-Land attacks that iteratively selects a set of uncertain and anomalous samples for labeling by a human analyst. LOLAL is specifically designed to work well when a limited number of labeled samples are available for training machine learning models to detect attacks. We investigate methods to represent command-line text using word-embedding techniques, and design ensemble boosting classifiers to distinguish malicious and benign samples based on the embedding representation. We leverage a large, anonymized dataset collected by an endpoint security product and demonstrate that our ensemble classifiers achieve an average F1 score of 96% at classifying different attack classes. We show that our active learning method consistently improves the classifier performance, as more training data is labeled, and converges in less than 30 iterations when starting with a small number of labeled instances. },

This research developed an intrusion detection that corresponded to the attack behavior by inspecting the components of SIP messages from the network traffic. The rules determination applied to detect intrusion related to unauthorized access, sending fraudulent SIP messages for denial of service, and flooding with malformed packets to reduce the performance of the network operation. The data collection would be from actual operation of the system in scenarios of attack and normal activity. The performance measure of data classification using machine learning algorithms shows that the support vector machine had the lowest accuracy of 90.81%, artificial neural network had an accuracy of 96.92%, decision tree had an accuracy of 99.29%, k-nearest neighbor had the highest accuracy of 99.81%.

We also emphasize the necessity for the system to be responsive to the operators constant curation of the training set. We show how this paradigm provides a property we call isolation and how it relates to classical causative attacks.In order to demonstrate the effects of drift on a binary classification task, we also report on two experiments using a previously unpublished malware data set where each instance is timestamped according to when it was seen.},

To defend against privacy attacks, we propose Privacy Guardian, a preventive policy enforcement system against privacy malwares. The design of Privacy Guardian takes into consideration the users' little understanding of Android permission mechanism. In the system, the user only needs to intervene during the first T time units from a privacy-gathering operation or the first time a privacy-diffusing operation is monitored after the expiration of T time units. Its execution is specified as a Finite State Machine, and its security properties are proved formally by using Liner Temporal Logic. We demonstrate that Privacy Guardian offers good performance in terms of detection time and execution cost compared to static and dynamic analysis-based IDS. In addition, the efficiency of Privacy Guardian is studied in terms of accuracy rate and positive rate.},

Current security solutions, such as firewalls, access controls, and intrusion detection and response systems, can protect SCADA systems from cyber assaults (e.g., denial of service attacks, SQL injection attacks, and spoofing attacks), but they are far from perfect. A new technology is emerging to enable self-protection in SCADA systems. Self-protecting SCADA systems are typically an integration of system behavior monitoring, attack estimation and prevention, known and unknown attack detection, live forensics analysis, and system behavior regulation with appropriate responses. This paper first discusses the key components of a self-protecting SCADA system and then surveys the state-of-the-art research and techniques to the realization of such systems.},

abstract = {One of the challenges in database security is timely detection of an insider attack. This gets more challenging in the case of sophisticated / expert insiders. Behavioral-based techniques have shown promising results in detecting insider attacks. Most of the behavioral-based techniques consider a query in isolation in order to model an insider's normative behavior thus only detecting malicious behavior that is limited to single query. A recently proposed approach considers sequences of queries to model an insider's normative behavior by using n-grams that capture shortterm correlations in an application [1]. However, behavioral-based approaches, including the n-gram approach, are vulnerable to mimicry attacks whereby a sophisticated inside attacker can craft a sequence of statements to mimic normal behavior as a set of legitimate transactions. Thus, a mechanism to detect this types of mimicry attack is desirable. In this paper, we first demonstrate an example mimicry attack on an n-gram based approach and then propose a behavioral-based technique that facilitate its detection. The proposed technique complements existing behavioral-based approaches including the n-gram approach and it can be deployed independently. Experiments are presented whereby a queryanalytics model is used to construct normative behavior from query logs of a synthetic banking application system. Initial results indicate that the proposed model to construct normative behavior is effective in detecting insider attacks conforming to a demonstrated mimicry attack.},

abstract = {We study collaborative adaptive cruise control as a representative application for safety services provided by autonomous cars. We provide a detailed analysis of attacks that can be conducted by a motivated attacker targeting the collaborative adaptive cruise control algorithm, by influencing the acceleration reported by another car, or the local LIDAR and RADAR sensors. The attacks have a strong impact on passenger comfort, efficiency and safety, with two of such attacks being able to cause crashes. We also present two detection methods rooted in physical-based constraints and machine learning algorithms. We show the effectiveness of these solutions through simulations and discuss their limitations.},

abstract = {This survey focuses on intrusion detection systems (IDS) that leverage host-based data sources for detecting attacks on enterprise network. The host-based IDS (HIDS) literature is organized by the input data source, presenting targeted sub-surveys of HIDS research leveraging system logs, audit data, Windows Registry, file systems, and program analysis. While system calls are generally included in audit data, several publicly available system call datasets have spawned a flurry of IDS research on this topic, which merits a separate section. To accommodate current researchers, a section giving descriptions of publicly available datasets is included, outlining their characteristics and shortcomings when used for IDS evaluation. Related surveys are organized and described. All sections are accompanied by tables concisely organizing the literature and datasets discussed. Finally, challenges, trends, and broader observations are throughout the survey and in the conclusion along with future directions of IDS research. Overall, this survey was designed to allow easy access to the diverse types of data available on a host for sensing intrusion, the progressions of research using each, and the accessible datasets for prototyping in the area.},

abstract = {The finance industry is constantly faced with an ever evolving set of challenges including credit card fraud, identity theft, network intrusion, money laundering, human trafficking, and illegal sales of firearms. There are also newly emerging threats such as fake news in financial media that can lead to distortions in trading strategies and investment decisions. In addition, traditional problems such as customer analytics, forecasting, and recommendations take on a unique flavor when applied to financial data. A number of new ideas are emerging to tackle all these problems including semi-supervised learning methods, deep learning algorithms, network/graph based solutions as well as linguistic approaches. These methods must often be able to work in real-time and be able handle large volumes of data. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss both the problems faced by the financial industry and potential solutions. We have invited regular papers, positional papers and extended abstracts of work in progress. We have also encouraged short papers from financial industry practitioners that introduce domain specific problems and challenges to academic researchers. This event is the fourth in a sequence of finance related workshops we have organized at KDD since 2017.},

abstract = {Maintaining security and privacy in real-world enterprise networks is becoming more and more challenging. Cyber actors are increasingly employing previously unreported and state-of-the-art techniques to break into corporate networks. To develop novel and effective methods to thwart these sophisticated cyber attacks, we need datasets that reflect real-world enterprise scenarios to a high degree of accuracy. However, precious few such datasets are publicly available. Researchers still predominantly use the decade-old KDD datasets, however, studies showed that these datasets do not adequately reflect modern attacks like Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). In this work, we analyze the usefulness of the recently introduced DARPA Operationally Transparent Cyber (OpTC) dataset in this regard. We describe the content of the dataset in detail and present a qualitative analysis. We show that the OpTC dataset is an excellent candidate for advanced cyber threat detection research while also highlighting its limitations. Additionally, we propose several research directions where this dataset can be useful.},

abstract = {The security of cyber physical systems such as autonomous vehicle platoons plays a vital role in ensuring passenger safety. An adversary in control of a single vehicle can degrade platoon efficiency or even cause collisions. In this paper, we focus on detecting an attack meant to destabilize a platoon, thereby causing collisions, and identifying the source of the attack (i.e., the vehicle under control of the adversary) using Fully Connected Deep Neural Networks (FCDNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The vehicles in the platoon are assumed to be equipped with sensors (LIDAR and RADAR) that measure the range and relative speed of their immediate neighbors. These sensor data, modelled with noise following a Gaussian distribution, are used to train a FCDNN and CNN for attack detection and identification. The effectiveness of these networks are tested for different scenarios based on local and global sensor information availability. The initial study show that for a ten vehicle platoon, CNN detects and identifies an attack with highest accuracy of 97.5%, just by using the own local sensor information. We also show that the range measurements provide better accuracy in comparison to the velocity measurements. The platoon is modelled and simulated in MATLAB and neural networks are generated and tested using Tensorflow and Keras deep learning libraries.},

abstract = {A barrier to the widespread adoption of learning-based network intrusion detection tools is the in-situ training requirements for effective discrimination of malicious traffic. Supervised learning techniques necessitate a quantity of labeled examples that is often intractable, and at best cost-prohibitive. Recent advances in semi-supervised techniques have demonstrated the ability to generalize well based on a significantly smaller set of labeled samples. In network intrusion detection, placing reasonable requirements on the number of training examples provides realistic expectations that a learning-based system can be trained in the environment where it will be deployed. This in-situ training is necessary to ensure that the assumptions associated with the learning process hold, and thereby support a reasonable belief in the generalization ability of the resulting model. In this paper, we describe the application of a carefully selected nonparametric, semi-supervised learning algorithm to the network intrusion problem, and compare the performance to other model types using feature-based data derived from an operational network. We demonstrate dramatic performance improvements over supervised learning and anomaly detection in discriminating real, previously unseen, malicious network traffic while generating an order of magnitude fewer false alerts than any alternative, including a signature IDS tool deployed on the same network.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) based malicious traffic detection is an emerging security paradigm, particularly for zero-day attack detection, which is complementary to existing rule based detection. However, the existing ML based detection achieves low detection accuracy and low throughput incurred by inefficient traffic features extraction. Thus, they cannot detect attacks in realtime, especially in high throughput networks. Particularly, these detection systems similar to the existing rule based detection can be easily evaded by sophisticated attacks. To this end, we propose Whisper, a realtime ML based malicious traffic detection system that achieves both high accuracy and high throughput by utilizing frequency domain features. It utilizes sequential information represented by the frequency domain features to achieve bounded information loss, which ensures high detection accuracy, and meanwhile constrains the scale of features to achieve high detection throughput. In particular, attackers cannot easily interfere with the frequency domain features and thus Whisper is robust against various evasion attacks. Our experiments with 42 types of attacks demonstrate that, compared with the state-of-the-art systems, Whisper can accurately detect various sophisticated and stealthy attacks, achieving at most 18.36% improvement of AUC, while achieving two orders of magnitude throughput. Even under various evasion attacks, Whisper is still able to maintain around 90% detection accuracy.},

abstract = {Mobile malware is growing - both in overall volume and in number of existing variants - at a pace rapid enough that systematic manual, human analysis is becoming increasingly difficult. As a result, there is a pressing need for techniques and tools that provide automated analysis of mobile malware samples. We present A5, an open source automated system to process Android malware. A5 is a hybrid system combining static and dynamic malware analysis techniques. Android's architecture permits many different paths for malware to react to system events, any of which may result in malicious behavior. Key innovations in A5 consist of novel methods of interacting with mobile malware to better coerce malicious behavior, and in combining both virtual and physical pools of Android platforms to capture behavior that could otherwise be missed. The primary output of A5 is a set of network threat indicators and intrusion detection system signatures that can be used to detect and prevent malicious network activity. We detail A5's distributed design and demonstrate applicability of our interaction techniques using examples from real malware. Additionally, we compare A5 with other automated systems and provide performance measurements of an implementation, using a published dataset of 1,260 unique malware samples, showing that A5 can quickly process large amounts of malware. We provide a public web interface to our implementation of A5 that allows third parties to use A5 as a web service.},

In addition to advancing the specific intrusion detection techniques, substantial efforts have been devoted to the taxonomy of existing IDSs, mostly focusing on the methodology, audit source and architecture aspects. The employed metric is another decisive factor of IDS performance, yet a systematized understanding in this aspect is still lacking. As an initial effort towards this objective, a categorization of IDS metrics is proposed in this work, where existing IDS metrics are divided into four types - information theoretic, probabilistic, proximity-based, and reliability-based metrics. Simulation studies of several intrusion detection algorithms that match the proposed categorization are also conducted based on the KDD'99 dataset.},

Cyber threats are growing at an explosive pace making the existing security and privacy measures inadequate. Hence, everyone on the Internet is a product for hackers. Consequently, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used to produce accurate outputs from large complex databases, where the generated outputs can be used to predict and detect vulnerabilities in IoT-based systems. Furthermore, Blockchain (BC) techniques are becoming popular in modern IoT applications to solve security and privacy issues. Several studies have been conducted on either ML algorithms or BC techniques. However, these studies target either security or privacy issues using ML algorithms or BC techniques, thus posing a need for a combined survey on efforts made in recent years addressing both security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BC techniques. In this article, we provide a summary of research efforts made in the past few years, from 2008 to 2019, addressing security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BC techniques in the IoT domain. First, we discuss and categorize various security and privacy threats reported in the past 12 years in the IoT domain. We then classify the literature on security and privacy efforts based on ML algorithms and BC techniques in the IoT domain. Finally, we identify and illuminate several challenges and future research directions using ML algorithms and BC techniques to address security and privacy issues in the IoT domain.},

To achieve our goal, we analyze StrandHogg attack techniques and develop two countermeasures, one using Machine Learning and the other one using ActivityCounter - a reliable attack indicator, which we could synthetically engineer. Our first approach achieves an average F1 score of 92% across all attack variations, while ActivityCounter shows superior performance and efficiently detects all attack versions without false positives.

abstract = {One of the main challenges in security today is defending against malware attacks. As trends and anecdotal evidence show, preventing these attacks, regardless of their indiscriminate or targeted nature, has proven difficult: intrusions happen and devices get compromised, even at security-conscious organizations. As a consequence, an alternative line of work has focused on detecting and disrupting the individual steps that follow an initial compromise and are essential for the successful progression of the attack. In particular, several approaches and techniques have been proposed to identify the command and control (C8C) channel that a compromised system establishes to communicate with its controller.A major oversight of many of these detection techniques is the design’s resilience to evasion attempts by the well-motivated attacker. C8C detection techniques make widespread use of a machine learning (ML) component. Therefore, to analyze the evasion resilience of these detection techniques, we first systematize works in the field of C8C detection and then, using existing models from the literature, go on to systematize attacks against the ML components used in these approaches.},

Therefore, in the last few years, banks have upgraded their security to protect transactions from fraud. State-of-the-art solutions detect fraud as deviations from customers’ spending habits. To the best of our knowledge, almost all existing approaches do not provide an in-depth model’s granularity and security analysis against elusive attacks.In this article, we examine Banksealer, a decision support system for banking fraud analysis that evaluates the influence on detection performance of the granularity at which spending habits are modeled and its security against evasive attacks. First, we compare user-centric modeling, which builds a model for each user, with system-centric modeling, which builds a model for the entire system, from the point of view of detection performance. Then, we assess the robustness of Banksealer against malicious attackers that are aware of the structure of the models in use. To this end, we design and implement a proof-of-concept attack tool that performs mimicry attacks, emulating a sophisticated attacker that cloaks frauds to avoid detection. We experimentally confirm the feasibility of such attacks, their cost, and the effort required by an attacker in order to perform them. In addition, we discuss possible countermeasures.We provide a comprehensive evaluation on a large real-world dataset obtained from one of the largest Italian banks.},

First, the synthetic images are generated which conditioned on railway scene images at daytime and non-railway scene images at nighttime. Then, a SSD object detection model is trained using the generated synthetic samples. Finally, the trained SSD model is used to detect abnormal objects for infrared images at nighttime. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed data augmentation strategy and the object detection method for nighttime scene is effective.},

abstract = { Autonomous collaborative networks of devices are rapidly emerging in numerous domains, such as self-driving cars, smart factories, critical infrastructure, and Internet of Things in general. Although autonomy and self-organization are highly desired properties, they increase vulnerability to attacks. Hence, autonomous networks need dependable mechanisms to detect malicious devices in order to prevent compromise of the entire network. However, current mechanisms to detect malicious devices either require a trusted central entity or scale poorly. In this paper, we present GrandDetAuto, the first scheme to identify malicious devices efficiently within large autonomous networks of collaborating entities. GrandDetAuto functions without relying on a central trusted entity, works reliably for very large networks of devices, and is adaptable to a wide range of application scenarios thanks to interchangeable components. Our scheme uses random elections to embed integrity validation schemes in distributed consensus, providing a solution supporting tens of thousands of devices. We implemented and evaluated a concrete instance of GrandDetAuto on a network of embedded devices and conducted large-scale network simulations with up to 100 000 nodes. Our results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our scheme, revealing logarithmic growth in run-time and message complexity with increasing network size. Moreover, we provide an extensive evaluation of key parameters showing that GrandDetAuto is applicable to many scenarios with diverse requirements.},

abstract = {The Controller Area Network standard represents one of the most commonly used communication protocol present in today’s vehicles. While it’s main properties facilitate the communication between different control units, several protocol design considerations represent security problems. While it’s trivial for an attacker to gain access and control the system, solutions capable of mitigating such incidents lack from a vehicle’s network. The current work proposes a Statefull Firewall, together with a signature based Intrusion Detection System as a response. Beside this, a Secure Logging unit is brought up in addition to support our methods, enforcing them with integrity verifiable logs. },

abstract = {Anomaly detection is being regarded as an unsupervised learning task as anomalies stem from adversarial or unlikely events with unknown distributions. However, the predictive performance of purely unsupervised anomaly detection often fails to match the required detection rates in many tasks and there exists a need for labeled data to guide the model generation. Our first contribution shows that classical semi-supervised approaches, originating from a supervised classifier, are inappropriate and hardly detect new and unknown anomalies. We argue that semi-supervised anomaly detection needs to ground on the unsupervised learning paradigm and devise a novel algorithm that meets this requirement. Although being intrinsically non-convex, we further show that the optimization problem has a convex equivalent under relatively mild assumptions. Additionally, we propose an active learning strategy to automatically filter candidates for labeling. In an empirical study on network intrusion detection data, we observe that the proposed learning methodology requires much less labeled data than the state-of-the-art, while achieving higher detection accuracies.},

abstract = {We present a self-adaptation mechanism for Network Intrusion Detection System which uses a game-theoretical mechanism to increase system robustness against targeted attacks on IDS adaptation. We model the adaptation process as a strategy selection in sequence of single stage, two player games. The key innovation of our approach is a secure runtime game definition and numerical solution and real-time use of game solutions for dynamic system reconfiguration. Our approach is suited for realistic environments where we typically lack any ground truth information regarding traffic legitimacy/maliciousness and where the significant portion of system inputs may be shaped by the attacker in order to render the system ineffective. Therefore, we rely on the concept of challenge insertion: we inject a small sample of simulated attacks into the unknown traffic and use the system response to these attacks to define the game structure and utility functions. This approach is also advantageous from the security perspective, as the manipulation of the adaptive process by the attacker is far more difficult. Our experimental results suggest that the use of game-theoretical mechanism comes with little or no penalty when compared to traditional self-adaptation methods.},

Previous attempts to solve it have used auto-encoders to learn a representation of the normal behaviour of networks and detect anomalies according to reconstruction loss. In this paper, we study the problem of anomaly detection in computer networks and propose the concept of "auto-encoder losses transfer learning". This approach normalizes auto-encoder losses in different model deployments, providing the ability to transform loss vectors of different networks with potentially significant varying characteristics, properties, and behaviors into a domain invariant representation. This is forwarded to a global detection model that can detect and classify threats in a generalized way that is agnostic to the specific network deployment, allowing for comprehensive network coverage.},

abstract = {Separating benign domains from domains generated by DGAs with the help of a binary classifier is a well-studied problem for which promising performance results have been published. The corresponding multiclass task of determining the exact DGA that generated a domain enabling targeted remediation measures is less well studied. Selecting the most promising classifier for these tasks in practice raises a number of questions that have not been addressed in prior work so far. These include the questions on which traffic to train in which network and when, just as well as how to assess robustness against adversarial attacks. Moreover, it is unclear which features lead a classifier to a decision and whether the classifiers are real-time capable. In this paper, we address these issues and thus contribute to bringing DGA detection classifiers closer to practical use. In this context, we propose one novel classifier based on residual neural networks for each of the two tasks and extensively evaluate them as well as previously proposed classifiers in a unified setting. We not only evaluate their classification performance but also compare them with respect to explainability, robustness, and training and classification speed. Finally, we show that our newly proposed binary classifier generalizes well to other networks, is time-robust, and able to identify previously unknown DGAs.},

abstract = {In order to be resilient to attacks, a cyber-physical system (CPS) must be able to detect attacks before they can cause significant damage. To achieve this, emph{intrusion detection systems} (IDS) may be deployed, which can detect attacks and alert human operators, who can then intervene. However, the resource-constrained nature of many CPS poses a challenge, since reliable IDS can be computationally expensive. Consequently, computational nodes may not be able to perform intrusion detection continuously, which means that we have to devise a schedule for performing intrusion detection. While a uniformly random schedule may be optimal in a purely cyber system, an optimal schedule for protecting CPS must also take into account the physical properties of the system, since the set of adversarial actions and their consequences depend on the physical systems. Here, in the context of water distribution networks, we study IDS scheduling problems in two settings and under the constraints on the available battery supplies. In the first problem, the objective is to design, for a given duration of time $T$, scheduling schemes for IDS so that the probability of detecting an attack is maximized within that duration. We propose efficient heuristic algorithms for this general problem and evaluate them on various networks. In the second problem, our objective is to design scheduling schemes for IDS so that the overall lifetime of the network is maximized while ensuring that an intruder attack is always detected. Various strategies to deal with this problem are presented and evaluated for various networks.},

Traditional network-based IDSs are unable to efficiently detect IoT malware and new evolving forms of attacks like file-less attacks. In this article, we present a system level Device-Edge split IDS for IoT devices. Our IDS profiles IoT devices according to their “behavior” using system-level information like running process parameters and their system calls in an autonomous, efficient, and scalable manner and then detects anomalous behavior indicative of intrusions. The modular design of our IDS along with a unique device-edge split architecture allows for effective attack detection with minimal overhead on the IoT devices. We have extensively evaluated our system using a dataset of 3,973 traditional IoT malware samples and 8 types of sophisticated file-less attacks recently observed against IoT devices in our testbed. We report the evaluation results in terms of detection efficiency and computational.},

Training DL classification models, however, requires vast amounts of labeled data which is often expensive and time-consuming to collect. Also, DL models trained using data from one type of network may not be able to identify attacks on other types of network or identify new families of attacks discovered over time. In this paper, we propose and evaluate the use of adversarial domain adaptation to address the problem of scarcity of labeled training data in a dataset by transferring knowledge gained from an existing network intrusion detection (NID) dataset. Our approach works for scenarios where the source and target datasets have same or different feature spaces. We demonstrate that our proposed approach can create highly accurate DL classification models even when the number of labeled samples in the target dataset is significantly small.},

abstract = {Various defense schemes --- which determine the presence of an attack on the in-vehicle network --- have recently been proposed. However, they fail to identify which Electronic Control Unit (ECU) actually mounted the attack. Clearly, pinpointing the attacker ECU is essential for fast/efficient forensic, isolation, security patch, etc. To meet this need, we propose a novel scheme, called Viden (Voltage-based attacker identification), which can identify the attacker ECU by measuring and utilizing voltages on the in-vehicle network. The first phase of Viden, called ACK learning, determines whether or not the measured voltage signals really originate from the genuine message transmitter. Viden then exploits the voltage measurements to construct and update the transmitter ECUs' voltage profiles as their fingerprints. It finally uses the voltage profiles to identify the attacker ECU. Since Viden adapts its profiles to changes inside/outside of the vehicle, it can pinpoint the attacker ECU under various conditions. Moreover, its efficiency and design-compliance with modern in-vehicle network implementations make Viden practical and easily deployable. Our extensive experimental evaluations on both a CAN bus prototype and two real vehicles have shown that Viden can accurately fingerprint ECUs based solely on voltage measurements and thus identify the attacker ECU with a low false identification rate of 0.2%.},

abstract = {Wide adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and applications encounters security vulnerabilities as roadblocks. The heterogeneous nature of IoT systems prevents common benchmarks, such as the NSL-KDD dataset, from being used to test and verify the performance of different Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). In order to bridge this gap, in this paper, we examine specific attacks in the NSL-KDD dataset that can impact sensor nodes and networks in IoT settings. Furthermore, in order to detect the introduced attacks, we study eleven machine learning algorithms and report the results. Through numerical analysis, we show that tree-based methods and ensemble methods outperform the rest of the studied machine learning methods. Among the supervised algorithms, XGBoost ranks the first with 97% accuracy, 90.5% Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and 99.6% Area Under the Curve (AUC) performance. Moreover, a notable research finding of this study is that the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which is an unsupervised method, also performs reasonably well in the detection of the attacks in the NSL-KDD dataset and outperforms the accuracy of the Na\"{\i}ve Bayes classifier by 22.0%.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth of connectivity and autonomy for today’s automobiles, their security vulnerabilities are becoming one of the most urgent concerns in the automotive industry. The lack of message authentication in Controller Area Network (CAN), which is the most popular in-vehicle communication protocol, makes it susceptible to cyber attack. It has been demonstrated that the remote attackers can take over the maneuver of vehicles after getting access to CAN, which poses serious safety threats to the public.To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel intrusion detection system (IDS), called BTMonitor (Bit-time-based CAN Bus Monitor). It utilizes the small but measurable discrepancy of bit time in CAN frames to fingerprint their sender Electronic Control Units (ECUs). To reduce the requirement for high sampling rate, we calculate the bit time of recessive bits and dominant bits, respectively, and extract their statistical features as fingerprint. The generated fingerprint is then used to detect intrusion and pinpoint the attacker. BTMonitor can detect new types of masquerade attack that the state-of-the-art clock-skew-based IDS is unable to identify. We implement a prototype system for BTMonitor using Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA for data collection. We evaluate our method on both a CAN bus prototype and a real vehicle. The results show that BTMonitor can correctly identify the sender with an average probability of 99.76% on the real vehicle.},

abstract = { Most vehicles use the controller area network bus for communication between their components. Attackers who have already penetrated the in-vehicle network often utilize this bus in order to take control of safety-relevant components of the vehicle. Such targeted attack scenarios are often hard to detect by network intrusion detection systems because the specific payload is usually not contained within their training data sets. In this work, we describe an intrusion detection system that uses decision trees that have been modelled through genetic programming. We evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to artificial neural networks and rule-based approaches. For this, we model and simulate specific targeted attacks as well as several types of intrusions described in the literature. The results show that the genetic programming approach is well suited to identify intrusions with respect to complex relationships between sensor values which we consider important for the classification of specific targeted attacks. However, the system is less efficient for the classification of other types of attacks which are better identified by the alternative methods in our evaluation. Further research could thus consider hybrid approaches.},

With no training data, the system constructs the concepts in near real-time from statistically similar alert aggregates. Tracked concepts are then applied to incoming alerts for fast and high-fidelity aggregation. The concepts learned by CLEAR are significantly more unique and invariant when compared to those learned by alternative drift detection methods. Furthermore, it provides insights for how specific individual, or co-occuring, alerts arrive with distinct and consistent temporal patterns.},

However, these existing methods may struggle to handle variable time intervals between messages during transitions of vehicle driving modes. This paper proposes a simple and cost-effective method to ensure the security of the CAN bus that is based on constant message frequencies across vehicle driving modes. This proposed method does not require any modifications on the existing CAN bus and it is designed with the intent for efficient execution in platforms with very limited computational resources. Test results with the proposed method against two different vehicles and a frequency domain analysis are also presented in the paper.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are increasingly used in industrial settings and in safety-critical applications, generating a financial and social impact. Complementing to cryptographic means to protect the communication, it is desirable to monitor the performance of the system and detect attackers during operation. However, existing intrusion detection systems are too resource-demanding. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, energy-efficient system which makes use of mobile agents to detect intrusions based on the energy consumption of the sensor nodes as a metric. A linear regression model is applied to predict the energy consumption. Simulation results indicate that denial-of-service attacks such as flooding can be detected with high accuracy, while keeping the number of false positives very low.},

abstract = { Recently, reconstruction-based anomaly detection was proposed as an effective technique to detect attacks in dynamic industrial control networks. Unlike classical network anomaly detectors that observe the network traffic, reconstruction-based detectors operate on the measured sensor data, leveraging physical process models learned a priori. In this work, we investigate different approaches to evade prior-work reconstruction-based anomaly detectors by manipulating sensor data so that the attack is concealed. We find that replay attacks (commonly assumed to be very strong) show bad performance (i.e., increasing the number of alarms) if the attacker is constrained to manipulate less than 95% of all features in the system, as hidden correlations between the features are not replicated well. To address this, we propose two novel attacks that manipulate a subset of the sensor readings, leveraging learned physical constraints of the system. Our attacks feature two different attacker models: A white box attacker, which uses an optimization approach with a detection oracle, and a black box attacker, which uses an autoencoder to translate anomalous data into normal data. We evaluate our implementation on two different datasets from the water distribution domain, showing that the detector’s Recall drops from 0.68 to 0.12 by manipulating 4 sensors out of 82 in WADI dataset. In addition, we show that our black box attacks are transferable to different detectors: They work against autoencoder-, LSTM-, and CNN-based detectors. Finally, we implement and demonstrate our attacks on a real industrial testbed to demonstrate their feasibility in real-time.},

abstract = {Machine learning is widely used in security-sensitive settings like spam and malware detection, although it has been shown that malicious data can be carefully modified at test time to evade detection. To overcome this limitation, adversary-aware learning algorithms have been developed, exploiting robust optimization and game-theoretical models to incorporate knowledge of potential adversarial data manipulations into the learning algorithm. Despite these techniques have been shown to be effective in some adversarial learning tasks, their adoption in practice is hindered by different factors, including the difficulty of meeting specific theoretical requirements, the complexity of implementation, and scalability issues, in terms of computational time and space required during training. In this work, we aim to develop secure kernel machines against evasion attacks that are not computationally more demanding than their non-secure counterparts. In particular, leveraging recent work on robustness and regularization, we show that the security of a linear classifier can be drastically improved by selecting a proper regularizer, depending on the kind of evasion attack, as well as unbalancing the cost of classification errors. We then discuss the security of nonlinear kernel machines, and show that a proper choice of the kernel function is crucial. We also show that unbalancing the cost of classification errors and varying some kernel parameters can further improve classifier security, yielding decision functions that better enclose the legitimate data. Our results on spam and PDF malware detection corroborate our analysis.},

abstract = {In recent years, we have seen a number of successful attacks against high-profile targets, some of which have even caused severe physical damage. These examples have shown us that resourceful and determined attackers can penetrate virtually any system, even those that are secured by the "air-gap." Consequently, in order to minimize the impact of stealthy attacks, defenders have to focus not only on strengthening the first lines of defense but also on deploying effective intrusion-detection systems. Intrusion-detection systems can play a key role in protecting sensitive computer systems since they give defenders a chance to detect and mitigate attacks before they could cause substantial losses. However, an over-sensitive intrusion-detection system, which produces a large number of false alarms, imposes prohibitively high operational costs on a defender since alarms need to be manually investigated. Thus, defenders have to strike the right balance between maximizing security and minimizing costs. Optimizing the sensitivity of intrusion detection systems is especially challenging in the case when multiple inter-dependent computer systems have to be defended against a strategic attacker, who can target computer systems in order to maximize losses and minimize the probability of detection. We model this scenario as an attacker-defender security game and study the problem of finding optimal intrusion detection thresholds.},

abstract = { Modern-day cyber threats are growing more rapidly than ever before. To effectively defend against them, Anomaly-based Network intrusion detection systems (A-NIDS) must evolve continuously. Traditional machine learning techniques are ineffective in handling sequentially evolving tasks, and Neural Networks (NNs) in particular suffer from Catastrophic Forgetting (CF) of old tasks when trained on new ones. Continual Learning (CL) strategies help to mitigate CF by imposing constraints while training NNs on sequentially evolving data like network traffic. However, applying the CL framework in the design of A-NIDS is not straightforward due to the heavy Class Imbalance (CI) in the network traffic datasets. As a result, the performance of the system is very sensitive to the task execution order. In this work, we propose a CL based A-NIDS by applying sample replay with Class Balancing Reservoir Sampling (CBRS) to mitigate CI in a Class Incremental Setting (CIS). Using the CICIDS-2017 dataset, experiments are conducted by permuting the majority class across the different task execution orders using the proposed CL based A-NIDS. We find that using auxiliary memory with context-aware sample replacing strategies, CF can be reduced to a greater extent, as opposed to data augmentation techniques which may alter the original data distribution and increase training time (with oversampling methods).},

abstract = {Training classifiers that are robust against adversarially modified examples is becoming increasingly important in practice. In the field of malware detection, adversaries modify malicious binary files to seem benign while preserving their malicious behavior. We report on the results of a recently held robust malware detection challenge. There were two tracks in which teams could participate: the attack track asked for adversarially modified malware samples and the defend track asked for trained neural network classifiers that are robust to such modifications. The teams were unaware of the attacks/defenses they had to detect/evade. Although only 9 teams participated, this unique setting allowed us to make several interesting observations.We also present the challenge winner: GRAMS, a family of novel techniques to train adversarially robust networks that preserve the intended (malicious) functionality and yield high-quality adversarial samples. These samples are used to iteratively train a robust classifier. We show that our techniques, based on discrete optimization techniques, beat purely gradient-based methods. GRAMS obtained first place in both the attack and defend tracks of the competition.},

We discuss the APT threat model, focusing in particular on evasion techniques, and collect an extensive dataset for studying APT C&amp;C domains.Based on the gained insight, we propose a number of novel features to detect APTs, leveraging both semantic properties of the domains themselves and structural properties of their DNS infrastructure. We build Hawk-Eye, a system to classify domain names extracted from PCAP files, and use it to evaluate the performance of the various features we studied, and compare them to malicious domain detection features from the literature. We find that a holistic approach combining selected orthogonal features achieves the best performance, with an F1-score of 98.53% and a FPR of 0.35%.},

If an attacker is mostly passive and monitoring SCADA communication traffic or is clever enough to act under the radar of intrusion/anomaly detection systems, it is challenging to counter them. In this direction, deception technology is an effective cybersecurity tool, by deploying a large number of dummy and decoy devices throughout the system infrastructure to be protected, for capturing probing attempts and lateral movement of persistent attackers and malware. In this paper, we discuss the practical design and implementation of high-fidelity deception devices for smart power grid systems, named DecIED. DecIED imitates the device characteristics and communication models of IEC 61850-compliant IEDs (intelligent electronic devices) and thus realize k-anonymous smokescreen, which virtually shows k-1 indistinguishable decoy devices, to protect our critical infrastructure. Based on our prototype implementation, a single industry PC can host over 200 deception devices, which demonstrates DecIED's scalability and feasibility of integration into the existing systems.},

We present in this paper a graph-based ransomware countermeasure to detect malicious threads. It is a new mechanism that doesn't rely on previously used metrics in the literature to detect ransomware such as Shannon's entropy or system calls. An accurate detection is achieved by our solution. The per-thread file system traversal is sufficient to highlight the malicious behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has been conducted in this area.

abstract = {Advances on differentiating between malicious intent and natural “organizational evolution” to explain observed anomalies in operational workplace patterns suggest benefit from evaluating collective behaviors observed in the facilities to improve insider threat detection and mitigation (ITDM). Advances in artificial neural networks (ANN) provide more robust pathways for capturing, analyzing, and collating disparate data signals into quantitative descriptions of operational workplace patterns. In response, a joint study by Sandia National Laboratories and the University of Texas at Austin explored the effectiveness of commercial artificial neural network (ANN) software to improve ITDM. This research demonstrates the benefit of learning patterns of organizational behaviors, detecting off-normal (or anomalous) deviations from these patterns, and alerting when certain types, frequencies, or quantities of deviations emerge for improving ITDM. Evaluating nearly 33,000 access control data points and over 1,600 intrusion sensor data points collected over a nearly twelve-month period, this study's results demonstrated the ANN could recognize operational patterns at the Nuclear Engineering Teaching Laboratory (NETL) and detect off-normal behaviors—suggesting that ANNs can be used to support a data-analytic approach to ITDM. Several representative experiments were conducted to further evaluate these conclusions, with the resultant insights supporting collective behavior-based analytical approaches to quantitatively describe insider threat detection and mitigation.},

abstract = {Since its first appearance more than 20 years ago, PHP has steadily increased in popularity, and has become the foundation of the Internet's most popular content management systems (CMS). Of the world's 1 million most visited websites, nearly half use a CMS, and WordPress alone claims 25% market share of all websites. While their easy-to-use templates and components have greatly simplified the work of developing high quality websites, it comes at the cost of software vulnerabilities that are inevitable in such large and rapidly evolving frameworks.Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are often used to protect Internet-facing applications, but conventional techniques struggle to keep up with the fast pace of development in today's web applications. Rapid changes to application interfaces increase the workload of maintaining an IDS whitelist, yet the broad attack surface of a web application makes for a similarly verbose blacklist. We developed ZenIDS to dynamically learn the trusted execution paths of an application during a short online training period and report execution anomalies as potential intrusions.We implement ZenIDS as a PHP extension supported by 8 hooks instrumented in the PHP interpreter. Our experiments demonstrate its effectiveness monitoring live web traffic for one year to 3 large PHP applications, detecting malicious requests with a false positive rate of less than .01% after training on fewer than 4,000 requests. ZenIDS excludes the vast majority of deployed PHP code from the whitelist because it is never used for valid requests---yet could potentially be exploited by a remote adversary. We observe 5% performance overhead (or less) for our applications vs. an optimized vanilla LAMP stack.},

abstract = {The rapid evolution towards the Industry 4.0 improves the performances of Industrial Control Systems (ICSs). However, due to the unmanageable re-engineering cost of pre-existing industrial devices, insecure protocols continue to be used to manage these systems. In this scenario, legacy protocols, such as the Modbus/TCP, are still largely used to control a range of industrial processes alongside with modern technologies. Consequently, hybrid industrial infrastructures with both legacy and innovative devices require novel security and prevention methodologies.In this work, we present AMON (Automaton MONitor): an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) for Modbus/TCP traffic monitoring. AMON combines DFA with the Longest Repeating Subsequence (LRS) algorithm, commonly used in bioinformatics, to model the traffic and identify anomalies. In order to address the challenges presented in hybrid scenarios, we extend AMON to work with the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), used for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). We show preliminary results in a simulated industrial network and discuss possible implementation of the developed detection system to secure hybrid industrial infrastructures.},

abstract = {Machine learning is vulnerable to adversarial examples--inputs designed to cause models to perform poorly. However, it is unclear if adversarial examples represent realistic inputs in the modeled domains. Diverse domains such as networks and phishing have domain constraints--complex relationships between features that an adversary must satisfy for an attack to be realized (in addition to any adversary-specific goals). In this paper, we explore how domain constraints limit adversarial capabilities and how adversaries can adapt their strategies to create realistic (constraint-compliant) examples. In this, we develop techniques to learn domain constraints from data, and show how the learned constraints can be integrated into the adversarial crafting process. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach in network intrusion and phishing datasets and find: (1) up to 82% of adversarial examples produced by state-of-the-art crafting algorithms violate domain constraints, (2) domain constraints are robust to adversarial examples; enforcing constraints yields an increase in model accuracy by up to 34%. We observe not only that adversaries must alter inputs to satisfy domain constraints, but that these constraints make the generation of valid adversarial examples far more challenging.},

abstract = {Critical infrastructures often depend upon cyber-physical systems (CPS), as seen in the smart grid, autonomous vehicle monitoring, industrial monitoring systems, etc. With the IT/OT convergence, cyber-physical systems became connected to the Internet through firewalls and De-militarized Zones (DMZs). Therefore, cyber-attacks disrupting critical infrastructure services are not uncommon. Advanced attackers often use techniques to subvert standard defenses such as network intrusion detection, firewall, etc., by using packet fragmentation, overlapping fragments, checksum manipulation, sequence number manipulation, etc. Therefore, attacks often go through perimeter defenses and start affecting the physical dynamics of the CPS. This paper proposes a robust intrusion detection system dubbed CatchAll for detecting attacks by finding anomalies in the dynamics of the cyber-physical systems. The proposed Intrusion Detection System(IDS) uses unsupervised learning, as the availability of labeled data is often a problem. We further assume that some fraction of the training data might get corrupted, possibly by network noise or data poisoning attacks. Such assumptions make our method applicable to real-world scenarios, where clean and trusted training data may not be available. The proposed IDS works in $O(d)$ space and time complexity at the deployment and outperforms existing anomaly detection techniques in several real-world data sets and attack scenarios.},

abstract = {Producing IEEE 802.15.4 PHY-frames reliably accepted by some digital radio receivers, but rejected by others---depending on the receiver chip's make and model---has strong implications for wireless security. Attackers could target specific receivers by crafting "shaped charges," attack frames that appear valid to the intended target and are ignored by all other recipients. By transmitting in the unique, slightly non-compliant "dialect" of the intended receivers, attackers would be able to create entire communication streams invisible to others, including wireless intrusion detection and prevention systems (WIDS/WIPS).These scenarios are no longer theoretic. We present methods of producing such IEEE 802.15.4 frames with commodity digital radio chips widely used in building inexpensive 802.15.4-conformant devices. Typically, PHY-layer fingerprinting requires software-defined radios that cost orders of magnitude more than the chips they fingerprint; however, our methods do not require a software-defined radio and use the same inexpensive chips.Knowledge of such differences, and the ability to fingerprint them is crucial for defenders. We investigate new methods of fingerprinting IEEE 802.15.4 devices by exploring techniques to differentiate between multiple 802.15.4-conformant radio-hardware manufacturers and firmware distributions. Further, we point out the implications of these results for WIDS, both with respect to WIDS evasion techniques and countering such evasion.},

abstract = {The Remote Access Trojan (RAT), whose exposure often lags far behind its widespread infection, plays a part in the growing number of cyber-attacks. In terms of intrusion detection, signature-based methods still occupy the dominant position together with anomaly-based methods that are deployed to be complementary. The anomaly-based methods are efficient and resource saving; however, anomaly-based RAT detection mainly utilizes machine learning on collective features without considering packet sequences. In addition, imbalanced data has a negative impact on machine learning classification. Accordingly, we analyzed packet sequences from various applications and found a general correlation between the packet direction sequences and the external control behaviors of RATs.This research presents a novel framework for tracking external control at the borders of area networks. We extract packet payload-size sequences, inter-arrival time sequences and packet direction sequences of IP flows. Then, RAT network behavior is exposed in the packet direction sequences of flow slices, which are generated by the inter-arrival time sequences. Na\"{\i}ve Bayes is utilized for classification, and a frequent sequence mining algorithm is implemented to eliminate noise. After deploying the device, we detected all the RAT sample sessions. Our method achieves a false positive rate of less than 0.6% on real-world campus network data, which demonstrates its efficacy.},

abstract = {Rogue certificates are valid certificates issued by a legitimate certificate authority (CA) that are nonetheless untrustworthy; yet trusted by web browsers and users. With the current public key infrastructure, there exists a window of vulnerability between the time a rogue certificate is issued and when it is detected. Rogue certificates from recent compromises have been trusted for as long as weeks before detection and revocation. Previous proposals to close this window of vulnerability require changes in the infrastructure, Internet protocols, or end user experience. We present a method for detecting rogue certificates from trusted CAs developed from a large and timely collection of certificates. This method automates classification by building machine-learning models with Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Despite the scarcity of rogue instances in the dataset, DNN produced a classification method that is proven both in simulation and in the July 2014 compromise of the India CCA. We report the details of the classification method and illustrate that it is repeatable, such as with datasets obtained from crawling. We describe the classification performance under our current research deployment.},

There are few high-quality, publicly-available audit logs, and there are no pre-existing frameworks that enable push-button creation of realistic system traces. To make trace generation easier, we created Xanthus, an automated tool that orchestrates virtual machines to generate realistic audit logs. Using Xanthus' simple management interface, administrators select a base VM image, configure a particular tracing framework to use within that VM, and define post-launch scripts that collect and save trace data. Once data collection is finished, Xanthus~creates a self-describing archive, which contains the VM, its configuration parameters, and the collected trace data. We demonstrate that Xanthus~hides many of the tedious (yet subtle) orchestration tasks that humans often get wrong; Xanthus~avoids mistakes that lead to non-replicable experiments.},

abstract = {As the Industry 4.0 or Internet of Things (IoT) era begins, security plays a key role in the Industry Internet of Things (IIoT) due to various threats, which include escape or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attackers in the virtualization layer and vulnerability exploiters in the device layer. A successful cross-VM escape attack in the virtualization layer combined with cross-layer penetration in the device layer, which we define as an Advanced Persistent Escaper (APE), poses a great threat. Therefore, the development of detection and rejection methods for APEs across multiple layers in IIoT is an open issue. To the best of our knowledge, less effective methods are established, especially for vulnerability exploitation in the virtualization layer and backdoor leverage in the device layer. On the basis of this, we propose Escaper Cops (EscaperCOP), a detection method for cross-VM escapers in the virtualization layer and cross-layer penetrators in the device layer. In particular, a new detection method for guest-to-host escapers is proposed for the virtualization layer. Finally, a novel encryption method based on Identity-based Broadcast Encryption (IBBE) is proposed to protect the critical components in EscaperCOP, detection library, and control command library. To verify our method, experimental tests are performed for a large number of APEs in an IIoT framework. The test results have demonstrated the proposed method is effective with an acceptable level of detection ratio.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) provide a set of useful analytic and decision-making techniques that are being leveraged by an ever-growing community of practitioners, including many whose applications have security-sensitive elements. However, while security researchers often utilize such techniques to address problems and AI/ML researchers develop techniques for Big Data analytics applications, neither community devotes much attention to the other. Within security research, AI/ML components are usually regarded as black-box solvers. Conversely, the learning community seldom considers the security/privacy implications entailed in the application of their algorithms when they are designing them. While these two communities generally focus on different directions, where these two fields do meet, interesting problems appear. Researchers working in this intersection have raised many novel questions for both communities and created a new branch of research known as secure learning. The AISec workshop has become the primary venue for this unique fusion of research. In recent years, there has been an increase of activity within the AISec/secure learning community. There are several reasons for this surge. Firstly, machine learning, data mining, and other artificial intelligence technologies play a key role in extracting knowledge, situational awareness, and security intelligence from Big Data. Secondly, companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Splunk are increasingly exploring and deploying learning technologies to address Big Data problems for their customers.},

This paper suggests a novel fingerprinting method that addresses this problem by building a higher-level end-node representation on top of the weak features. Conducted large-scale experiments on real network data show superior performance of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art solution in terms of both a lower number of produced false alarms (precision) and a higher number of detected infections (recall).},

abstract = {Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) are transforming modern networks towards a service-oriented architecture. At the same time, the cybersecurity industry is rapidly adopting Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to improve detection and mitigation of complex attacks. Traditional intrusion detection systems perform signature-based detection, based on well-known malicious traffic patterns that signify potential attacks. The main drawback of this method is that attack patterns need to be known in advance and signatures must be preconfigured. Hence, typical systems fail to detect a zero-day attack or an attack with unknown signature. This work considers the use of machine learning for advanced anomaly detection, and specifically deploys the Apache Spot ML framework on an SDN/NFV-enabled testbed running cybersecurity services as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). VNFs are used to capture traffic for ingestion by the ML algorithm and apply mitigation measures in case of a detected anomaly. Apache Spot utilises Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify anomalous traffic patterns in Netflow, DNS and proxy data. The overall performance of Apache Spot is evaluated by deploying Denial of Service (Slowloris, BoNeSi) and a Data Exfiltration attack (iodine).},

Different from the state of the art, which traditionally focuses on univariate measurements, Net-GAN detects anomalies in multivariate time-series, ex- ploiting temporal dependencies through RNNs. Net-GAN discovers the underlying distribution of the baseline, multi- variate data, without making any assumptions on its nature, offering a powerful approach to detect anomalies in com- plex, difficult to model network monitoring data. We further exploit the concepts behind generative models to conceive Net-VAE, a complementary approach to Net-GAN for net- work anomaly detection, based on variational auto-encoders (VAE). We evaluate Net-GAN and Net-VAE in different monitoring scenarios, including anomaly detection in IoT sensor data, and intrusion detection in network measure- ments. Generative models represent a promising approach for network anomaly detection, especially when considering the complexity and ever-growing number of time-series to monitor in operational networks.},

abstract = {The detection of malware intrusion requires the identification of its signature. However, it is a complex task due to the malware sophisticated ability to evade security mechanisms deployed by cybersecurity practitioners. Evasion is possible due to malware authors changing the malware signature using metamorphism or polymorphism tactics. Currently, it is necessary to formulate a malware detection method focusing on dynamic and automated malware analysis. Malware Indicator of Compromise (IOC) data analysis with machine learning can be used as a technique to obtain the malware signatures. This technical approach is practical as cyber-attacks using malware with new or changed signature are pandemic and remain undetected, therefore, a framework is needed to overcome this situation. Thus, this research proposed a malware detection framework based on forensic and unsupervised machine learning methodologies. The framework is experimented and proven in detecting malware by referring to the signature derived from the analysis. Furthermore, the framework can provide guidelines for cybersecurity practitioners to conduct threat hunting within their IT systems.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have induced tremendous growth in innovation and automation. Although these AI technologies offer significant benefits, they can be used maliciously. Highly targeted and evasive attacks in benign carrier applications, such as DeepLocker, have demonstrated the intentional use of AI for harmful purposes. Threat actors are constantly changing and improving their attack strategy with particular emphasis on the application of AI-driven techniques in the attack process, called AI-based cyber attack, which can be used in conjunction with conventional attack techniques to cause greater damage. Despite several studies on AI and security, researchers have not summarized AI-based cyber attacks enough to be able to understand the adversary’s actions and to develop proper defenses against such attacks. This study aims to explore existing studies of AI-based cyber attacks and to map them onto a proposed framework, providing insight into new threats. Our framework includes the classification of several aspects of malicious uses of AI during the cyber attack life cycle and provides a basis for their detection to predict future threats. We also explain how to apply this framework to analyze AI-based cyber attacks in a hypothetical scenario of a critical smart grid infrastructure.},

abstract = {This paper presents a study on detecting cyber attacks on industrial control systems (ICS) using convolutional neural networks. The study was performed on a Secure Water Treatment testbed (SWaT) dataset, which represents a scaled-down version of a real-world industrial water treatment plant. We suggest a method for anomaly detection based on measuring the statistical deviation of the predicted value from the observed value. We applied the proposed method by using a variety of deep neural network architectures including different variants of convolutional and recurrent networks. The test dataset included 36 different cyber attacks. The proposed method successfully detected 31 attacks with three false positives thus improving on previous research based on this dataset. The results of the study show that 1D convolutional networks can be successfully used for anomaly detection in industrial control systems and outperform recurrent networks in this setting. The findings also suggest that 1D convolutional networks are effective at time series prediction tasks which are traditionally considered to be best solved using recurrent neural networks. This observation is a promising one, as 1D convolutional neural networks are simpler, smaller, and faster than the recurrent neural networks.},

abstract = {Modelling network traffic is gaining importance to counter modern security threats of ever increasing sophistication. It is though surprisingly difficult and costly to construct reliable classifiers on top of telemetry data due to the variety and complexity of signals that no human can manage to interpret in full. Obtaining training data with sufficiently large and variable body of labels can thus be seen as a prohibitive problem. The goal of this work is to detect infected computers by observing their HTTP(S) traffic collected from network sensors, which are typically proxy servers or network firewalls, while relying on only minimal human input in the model training phase. We propose a discriminative model that makes decisions based on a computer's all traffic observed during a predefined time window (5 minutes in our case). The model is trained on traffic samples collected over equally-sized time windows for a large number of computers, where the only labels needed are (human) verdicts about the computer as a whole (presumed infected vs. presumed clean). As part of training, the model itself learns discriminative patterns in traffic targeted to individual servers and constructs the final high-level classifier on top of them. We show the classifier to perform with very high precision, and demonstrate that the learned traffic patterns can be interpreted as Indicators of Compromise. We implement the discriminative model as a neural network with special structure reflecting two stacked multi instance problems. The main advantages of the proposed configuration include not only improved accuracy and ability to learn from gross labels, but also automatic learning of server types (together with their detectors) that are typically visited by infected computers.},

abstract = {Many network intrusion detection systems use byte sequences to detect lateral movements that exploit remote vulnerabilities. Attackers bypass such detection by stealing valid credentials and using them to transmit from one computer to another without creating abnormal network traffic. We call this method Credential-based Lateral Movement. To detect this type of lateral movement, we develop the concept of a Network Login Structure that specifies normal logins within a given network. Our method models a network login structure by automatically extracting a collection of login patterns by using a variation of the market-basket algorithm. We then employ an anomaly detection approach to detect malicious logins that are inconsistent with the enterprise network's login structure. Evaluations show that the proposed method is able to detect malicious logins in a real setting. In a simulated attack, our system was able to detect 82% of malicious logins, with a 0.3% false positive rate. We used a real dataset of millions of logins over the course of five months within a global financial company for evaluation of this work.},

abstract = {Recent research1 has shown that machine learning models are venerable to attacks by adversaries almost at all phases of machine learning pipeline, such as positioning attacks on training data, attacks on the learning algorithm, input attacks based on carefully crafted adversarial samples, model steal and model inversion attack etc. Input samples that are maliciously created can affect the learning process of a ML system by either slowing the learning process, or affecting the performance of the learned model or causing the system make error. So, understanding the security of machine learning algorithms and systems is emerging as an important research area among computer security and machine learning researchers and practitioners. We present a survey on this emerging area: firstly, we define the processing pipeline of a generic machine learning system, then, we identify the attacks in different points of the pipeline and its potential defense solution. Finally, the research work of this paper is summarized and the further research directions are proposed.},

This tool leverages on a set of mutation operators that alter the syntax of a pay load without affecting the original semantics. We evaluate the performance of the tool against existing WAFs, that we trained using our publicly available SQL query dataset.

abstract = { QUIC is an emerging transport protocol that has the potential to replace TCP in the near future. As such, QUIC will become an important target for Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). Reliable DPI is essential, e.g., for corporate environments, to monitor traffic entering and leaving their networks. However, elusion strategies threaten the validity of DPI systems, as they allow attackers to carefully design traffic to fool and thus evade on-path DPI systems. While such elusion strategies for TCP are well documented, it is unclear if attackers will be able to elude QUIC-based DPI systems. In this paper, we systematically explore elusion methodologies for QUIC. To this end, we present DPIFuzz: a differential fuzzing framework which can automatically detect strategies to elude stateful DPI systems for QUIC. We use DPIFuzz to generate and mutate QUIC streams in order to compare (and find differences in) the server-side interpretations of five popular open-source QUIC implementations. We show that DPIFuzz successfully reveals DPI elusion strategies, such as using packets with duplicate packet numbers or exploiting the diverging handling of overlapping stream offsets by QUIC implementations. DPIFuzz additionally finds four security-critical vulnerabilities in these QUIC implementations.},

abstract = {The availability of ready-to-use public security datasets is fostering measurement-driven research by a wide community of academics and practitioners. Recent trends in this area put forth a substantial body of literature on anomaly and attack detection on the top of public labelled datasets. Much of this literature blindly reuses existing datasets by overlooking the cybersecurity facets of the network traffic therein, in terms of its real impact on service availability and performance of operations.This paper addresses the representativeness of network traffic data provided by public datasets for cybersecurity research. To this aim, it proposes an initial exploration of the topic by means of a case study on Denial of Service (DoS) traffic of CICIDS2017, which is a recent dataset collected in a controlled environment that gained massive attention over the past two years. DoS traffic, which is available in CICIDS2017 in the form of packet data files, is replayed against a victim server in a controlled testbed. Measurements indicate that the DoS traffic, although somewhat relevant at network-level, has limited impact at application-level (i.e., by taking into account the performance of the victim under attack). The findings provide some key insights into the limitations of the data assessed in the study, paving the way for the construction of more rigorous datasets conceived with a multilayer perspective and that reflect actual traffic conditions under normative operations and disruptive attacks.},

abstract = {Hardware Malware Detectors (HMDs) have recently been proposed as a defense against the proliferation of malware. These detectors use low-level features, that can be collected by the hardware performance monitoring units on modern CPUs to detect malware as a computational anomaly. Several aspects of the detector construction have been explored, leading to detectors with high accuracy. In this paper, we explore the question of how well evasive malware can avoid detection by HMDs. We show that existing HMDs can be effectively reverse-engineered and subsequently evaded, allowing malware to hide from detection without substantially slowing it down (which is important for certain types of malware). This result demonstrates that the current generation of HMDs can be easily defeated by evasive malware. Next, we explore how well a detector can evolve if it is exposed to this evasive malware during training. We show that simple detectors, such as logistic regression, cannot detect the evasive malware even with retraining. More sophisticated detectors can be retrained to detect evasive malware, but the retrained detectors can be reverse-engineered and evaded again. To address these limitations, we propose a new type of Resilient HMDs (RHMDs) that stochastically switch between different detectors. These detectors can be shown to be provably more difficult to reverse engineer based on resent results in probably approximately correct (PAC) learnability theory. We show that indeed such detectors are resilient to both reverse engineering and evasion, and that the resilience increases with the number and diversity of the individual detectors. Our results demonstrate that these HMDs offer effective defense against evasive malware at low additional complexity.},

abstract = { It is of great practical significance to accurately model and analyze abnormal events in time series. For example, the identification of anomaly patterns on infrastructure sensor curves helps locate equipment failures. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection approach for time series, which can comprehensively consider both point anomalies and subsequence anomalies. We innovatively introduce RNN into the architecture of Adversarial Autoencoder to better analyze anomaly events based on overall relationship of time series. In addition, we innovatively apply the Outlier Exposure technique for the performance optimization of anomaly detector. Meanwhile, a WGAN-based method is utilized to generate anomaly datasets through normal distribution learning. Finally, we apply the proposed method for fraud detection on a financial statement dataset and intrusion detection on a network traffic dataset. Experimental results demonstrates that our model can comprehensively consider different anomaly types in time series, and achieve promising detection performance overall. In the experiment of fraud detection, the LSTM integrated AAE model achieves an F1 score of 0.810, while the Outlier Exposure enhanced model achieves an F1 score of 0.894. This indicates that our method can improve the performance of current audit systems and facilitate discovering malicious behaviors.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) consist of software and physical components which are knitted together and interact with each other continuously. CPS have been targets of security attacks due to their safety-critical nature and relative lack of protection. Specification based intrusion detection systems (IDS) using data, temporal, data temporal and time, and logical correlations have been proposed in the past. But none of the approaches except the ones using logical correlations take into account the main ingredient in the operation of CPS, namely the use of physical properties. On the other hand, IDS that use physical properties either require the developer to define invariants manually, or have designed their IDS for a specific CPS. This paper proposes CORGIDS, a generic IDS capable of detecting security attacks by inferring the logical correlations of the physical properties of a CPS, and checking if they adhere to the predefined framework. We build a CORGIDS-based prototype and demonstrate its use for detecting attacks in the two CPS. We find that CORGIDS achieves a precision of 95.70%, and a recall of 87.90%, with modest memory and performance overheads.},

abstract = {Active defense is a popular defense technique based on systems that hinder an attacker's progress by design, rather than reactively responding to an attack only after its detection. Well-known active defense systems are honeypots. Honeypots are fake systems, designed to look like real production systems, aimed at trapping an attacker, and analyzing his attack strategy and goals. These types of systems suffer from a major weakness: it is extremely hard to design them in such a way that an attacker cannot distinguish them from a real production system. In this paper, we advocate that, instead of adding additional fake systems in the corporate network, the production systems themselves should be instrumented to provide active defense capabilities. This perspective to active defense allows containing costs and complexity, while at the same time provides the attacker with a more realistic-looking target, and gives the Incident Response Team more time to identify the attacker. The proposed proof-of-concept prototype system can be used to implement active defense in any corporate production network, with little upfront work, and little maintenance.},

Hence, in this work, we investigate the security risk of organizations with respect to different adversarial models of physical movement behavior. We study the case in which an intrusion detection mechanism is in place to alert the system administrator when users deviate from their normal movement behavior. We then analyze how different user behaviors may present themselves as different levels of threats in terms of their normal movement behavior within a given building topology. To quantify the differences in movement behavior, we define a WeightTopo metric that takes into account the building topology in addition to the movement pattern. We demonstrate our approach on a railway system case study and show how certain user roles, when abused by attackers, are especially vulnerable in terms of the physical intrusion detection probability. We also evaluate quantitatively how the similarity between an attacker’s movement behavior and a user’s movement behavior affects the detection probability of the evaluated intrusion detection system. Certain individual users are found to pose a higher threat, implying the need for customized monitoring.},

abstract = {When deploying machine learning models in real-world applications, an open-world learning framework is needed to deal with both normal in-distribution inputs and undesired out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Open-world learning frameworks include OOD detectors that aim to discard input examples which are not from the same distribution as the training data of machine learning classifiers. However, our understanding of current OOD detectors is limited to the setting of benign OOD data, and an open question is whether they are robust in the presence of adversaries. In this paper, we present the first analysis of the robustness of open-world learning frameworks in the presence of adversaries by introducing and designing \o{}odAdvExamples. Our experimental results show that current OOD detectors can be easily evaded by slightly perturbing benign OOD inputs, revealing a severe limitation of current open-world learning frameworks. Furthermore, we find that \o{}odAdvExamples also pose a strong threat to adversarial training based defense methods in spite of their effectiveness against in-distribution adversarial attacks. To counteract these threats and ensure the trustworthy detection of OOD inputs, we outline a preliminary design for a robust open-world machine learning framework.},

abstract = {As Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as the next logical stage of the Internet, it has become imperative to understand the vulnerabilities of the IoT systems when supporting diverse applications. Because machine learning has been applied in many IoT systems, the security implications of machine learning need to be studied following an adversarial machine learning approach. In this paper, we propose an adversarial machine learning based partial-model attack in the data fusion/aggregation process of IoT by only controlling a small part of the sensing devices. Our numerical results demonstrate the feasibility of this attack to disrupt the decision making in data fusion with limited control of IoT devices, e.g., the attack success rate reaches 83% when the adversary tampers with only 8 out of 20 IoT devices. These results show that the machine learning engine of IoT system is highly vulnerable to attacks even when the adversary manipulates a small portion of IoT devices, and the outcome of these attacks severely disrupts IoT system operations.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection aims at identifying unexpected fluctuations in the expected behavior of a given system. It is acknowledged as a reliable answer to the identification of zero-day attacks to such extent, several ML algorithms that suit for binary classification have been proposed throughout years. However, the experimental comparison of a wide pool of unsupervised algorithms for anomaly-based intrusion detection against a comprehensive set of attacks datasets was not investigated yet. To fill such gap, we exercise 17 unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms on 11 attack datasets. Results allow elaborating on a wide range of arguments, from the behavior of the individual algorithm to the suitability of the datasets to anomaly detection. We conclude that algorithms as Isolation Forests, One-Class Support Vector Machines, and Self-Organizing Maps are more effective than their counterparts for intrusion detection, while clustering algorithms represent a good alternative due to their low computational complexity. Further, we detail how attacks with unstable, distributed, or non-repeatable behavior such as Fuzzing, Worms, and Botnets are more difficult to detect. Ultimately, we digress on capabilities of algorithms in detecting anomalies generated by a wide pool of unknown attacks, showing that achieved metric scores do not vary with respect to identifying single attacks.},

abstract = {Many research projects studying security threats require realistic network scenarios while dealing with millions of cyber threats (e.g., exploit programs and malware). For instance, studying the execution of malware may require to take into account different network configurations in which malware can propagate, as well as dealing with thousands (or millions) of different malware samples. The same challenge occurs if one wants to evaluate IDSs, study exploit programs or conduct vulnerability assessment using realistic network scenarios.Moreover, cyber threats are highly dynamic. Every day, new vulnerabilities are identified and documented in software commonly used by computers connected to the Internet, and new malware instances and exploit programs are also identified. Consequently, it is not viable to develop (deploy) an environment every time cyber threats or security products (e.g., IDSs and anti-virus) have to be studied from a different perspective.New research methodologies and tools are needed to systematically conduct cyber security research. Automation is required to deal with the increasingly large number of cyber threats. In this paper, we draw the foundations of an experimental approach to cyber security by providing the blueprints of a lightweight Automated Experimentation System (AES). The AES automatically executes experiments based on a specification file. We describe its usage in different network security research projects, from IDS evaluation to static and dynamic malware analysis. The results we derived from these different research projects show that our experimental approach to cyber security, enabled by the AES, enhances the scope (and scale) of research in this field. Consequently, the AES improves our understanding of cyber threats and our assessment of the current state of security products.},

However, there is still a general lack of understanding of deception techniques from a research perspective, and it is not clear how the effectiveness of these solutions can be measured and compared with other security approaches. To shed light on this topic, we introduce a comprehensive classification of existing solutions and survey the current application of deception techniques in computer security. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing solutions, and we analyze several open research directions, including the design of strategies to help defenders to design and integrate deception within a target architecture, the study of automated ways to deploy deception in complex systems, the update and re-deployment of deception, and, most importantly, the design of new techniques and experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the existing deception techniques.},

abstract = {Bots are the root cause of many security problems on the Internet, as they send spam, steal information from infected machines, and perform distributed denial-of-service attacks. Many approaches to bot detection have been proposed, but they either rely on end-host installations, or, if they operate on network traffic, require deep packet inspection for signature matching.In this paper, we present BotFinder, a novel system that detects infected hosts in a network using only high-level properties of the bot's network traffic. BotFinder does not rely on content analysis. Instead, it uses machine learning to identify the key features of command-and-control communication, based on observing traffic that bots produce in a controlled environment. Using these features, BotFinder creates models that can be deployed at network egress points to identify infected hosts. We trained our system on a number of representative bot families, and we evaluated BotFinder on real-world traffic datasets -- most notably, the NetFlow information of a large ISP that contains more than 25 billion flows. Our results show that BotFinder is able to detect bots in network traffic without the need of deep packet inspection, while still achieving high detection rates with very few false positives.},

Furthermore, Guardian Nodes regularly update themselves with latest threat models to provide effective security against new and emerging threats. Our evaluation proves that CommunityGuard provides immunity against a range of incoming and outgoing attacks at all points of time with an acceptable impact on network performance. Oftentimes, the sources of DDoS attack traffic are personal devices that have been compromised without the owner's knowledge. We have modeled CommunityGuard to prevent such outgoing DDoS traffic on a wide scale which can hamstring the otherwise very frightening prospects of crippling DDoS attacks.},

Due to significant research effort in this domain there are many different detection methods based on diverse technical principles. Of these, detection based-on network traffic analysis is one of the noninvasive and resilient detection techniques. There are several survey papers published on the detection methods, but either they didn't mention the analysis of the proposed methods or they just demonstrated a few different dimensions or did not have dimensions at all. Therefore, a complete evaluation framework for assessing the proposed methods is vital. In this paper, we first provide a comprehensive overview of this field by summarizing current significant methods and gathers all related network traffic features followed by a new evaluation framework with fourteen dimensions and the analysis of the existing detection methods to identify their characteristics, limitations, and performances.},

abstract = {Network scanning reveals valuable information of accessible hosts over the Internet and their offered network services, which allows significant narrowing of potential targets to attack. Addressing and balancing a set of sometimes competing desirable properties is required to make network scanning detection more appealing in practice: 1) fast detection of scanning activity to enable prompt response by intrusion detection and prevention systems; 2) acceptable rate of false alarms, keeping in mind that false alarms may lead to legitimate traffic being penalized; 3) high detection rate with the ability to detect stealthy scanners; 4) efficient use of monitoring system resources; and 5) immunity to evasion. In this paper, we present a scanning detection algorithm designed to accommodate all of these goals. LQS is a fast, accurate, and light-weight scan detection algorithm that leverages the key properties of the monitored network environment as variables that affect how the scanning detection algorithm operates. We also present what is, to our knowledge, the first automated way to estimate a reference baseline in the absence of ground truth, for use as an evaluation methodology for scan detection. Using network traces from two sites, we evaluate LQS and compare its scan detection results with those obtained by the state-of-the-art TRW algorithm. Our empirical analysis shows significant improvements over TRW in all of these properties.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) techniques are being used to detect increasing amounts of malware and variants. Despite successful applications of ML, we hypothesize that the full potential of ML is not realized in malware analysis (MA) due to a semantic gap between the ML and MA communities---as demonstrated in the data that is used. Due in part to the available data, ML has primarily focused on detection whereas MA is also interested in identifying behaviors. We review existing open-source malware datasets used in ML and find a lack of behavioral information that could facilitate stronger impact by ML in MA. As a first step in bridging this gap, we label existing data with behavioral information using open-source MA reports---1) altering the analysis from identifying malware to identifying behaviors, 2)~aligning ML better with MA, and 3)~allowing ML models to generalize to novel malware in a zero/few-shot learning manner. We classify the behavior of a malware family not seen during training using transfer learning from a state-of-the-art model for malware family classification and achieve 57% - 84% accuracy on behavioral identification but fail to outperform the baseline set by a majority class predictor. This highlights opportunities for improvement on this task related to the data representation, the need for malware specific ML techniques, and a larger training set of malware samples labeled with behaviors.},

abstract = {The modern vehicle has transformed from a purely mechanical system to a system that embeds several electronic devices. These devices communicate through the in-vehicle network for enhanced safety and comfort but are vulnerable to cyber-physical risks and attacks. A well-known technique of detecting these attacks and unusual events is by using intrusion detection systems. Anomalies in the network occur at unknown points and produce abrupt changes in the statistical features of the message stream. In this paper, we propose an anomaly-based intrusion detection approach using the cumulative sum (CUSUM) change-point detection algorithm to detect data injection attacks on the controller area network (CAN) bus. We leverage the parameters required for the change-point algorithm to reduce false alarm rate and detection delay. Using real dataset generated from a car in normal operation, we evaluate our detection approach on three different kinds of attack scenarios.},

While the massive deployment of connected devices offers opportunities to improve quality of life and to develop new services, the impact of such devices on the security of the users in a context where the level of malicious threat continues to increase is a major concern. One of the challenges is the heterogeneity and constant evolution of wireless technologies and protocols used. To overcome this problem, we propose RIDS, a Radio Intrusion Detection System that is based on the monitoring and profiling of radio communications at the physical layer level using autoencoder neural networks. RIDS is independent of the wireless protocols and modulation technologies used. Besides, it is designed to provide a threefold diagnosis of the detected anomalies: temporal (start and end date of the detected anomaly), frequential (main frequency of the anomaly), and spatial (location of the origin of the anomaly). To demonstrate the relevance and the efficiency of our approach, we collected a large dataset of radio-communications recorded with three different probes deployed in an experimental room. Multiple real-world attacks involving a wide variety of communication technologies are also injected to assess the detection and diagnosis efficiency. The results demonstrate the efficiency of RIDS in detecting and diagnosing anomalies that occurred in the 400–500&nbsp;Mhz and 800–900&nbsp;Mhz frequency bands. It is noteworthy that compromised devices and attacks using these communication bands are generally not easily covered by traditional solutions.},

Previous work focused on detecting if a web site is malicious by dynamically executing JavaScript in instrumented environments or by rendering web sites in client honeypots. Both techniques bear a significant evaluation overhead, since the analysis can take up to tens of seconds or even minutes per sample. In this paper, we introduce a novel, purely static analysis approach, the Delta-system, that (i) extracts change-related features between two versions of the same website, (ii) uses a machine-learning algorithm to derive a model of web site changes, (iii) detects if a change was malicious or benign, (iv) identifies the underlying infection vector campaign based on clustering, and (iv) generates an identifying signature.We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Delta-system by evaluating it on a dataset of over 26 million pairs of web sites by running next to a web crawler for a period of four months.

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices in clustered wireless networks can be compromised by compromising the gateway which they are associated with. In such scenarios, an adversary who has compromised the gateway can affect the network's performance by deliberately dropping the packets transmitted by the IoT devices. In this way, the adversary can actually mimic a bad radio channel. Hence, the affected IoT device has to retransmit the packet which will drain its battery at a faster rate. To detect such an attack, we propose a centralized detection system in this paper. It uses the uplink packet drop probability of the IoT devices to monitor the behavior of the gateway with which they are associated. The detection rule proposed is given by the generalized likelihood ratio test, where the attack probabilities are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. Results presented show the effectiveness of the proposed detection mechanism and also demonstrate the impact of the choice of system parameters on the detection algorithm.},

In this work, we propose structural taxonomy and novel categorization of research that contribute to the organization and disambiguation of insider threat incidents and the defense solutions used against them. The objective of our categorization is to systematize knowledge in insider threat research while using an existing grounded theory method for rigorous literature review. The proposed categorization depicts the workflow among particular categories that include incidents and datasets, analysis of incidents, simulations, and defense solutions. Special attention is paid to the definitions and taxonomies of the insider threat; we present a structural taxonomy of insider threat incidents that is based on existing taxonomies and the 5W1H questions of the information gathering problem. Our survey will enhance researchers’ efforts in the domain of insider threat because it provides (1) a novel structural taxonomy that contributes to orthogonal classification of incidents and defining the scope of defense solutions employed against them, (2) an overview on publicly available datasets that can be used to test new detection solutions against other works, (3) references of existing case studies and frameworks modeling insiders’ behaviors for the purpose of reviewing defense solutions or extending their coverage, and (4) a discussion of existing trends and further research directions that can be used for reasoning in the insider threat domain.},

We consider the problem of defending the system against multiple data falsification attacks (Byzantine attacks), a vulnerability of distributed peer-to-peer consensus algorithms that has not been widely addressed in its practicality. We consider both naive (independent) and colluding attackers. We test three defense strategy implementations, two classified as outlier detection methods and one reputation-based method. We have narrowed our attention to outlier and reputation-based methods because they are relatively light computationally speaking. We have left out control theoretic methods which are likely the most effective methods, however their computational cost increase rapidly with the number of attackers. We compare the efficiency of these three implementations for their computational cost, detection performance, convergence behavior and possible impacts on the intrusion detection accuracy of the NIDS. Tests are performed based on simulations of distributed denial of service attacks using the KSL-KDD data set.},

abstract = {Measurements collected in a wireless sensor network (WSN) can be maliciously compromised through several attacks, but anomaly detection algorithms may provide resilience by detecting inconsistencies in the data. Anomaly detection can identify severe threats to WSN applications, provided that there is a sufficient amount of genuine information. This article presents a novel method to calculate an assurance measure for the network by estimating the maximum number of malicious measurements that can be tolerated. In previous work, the resilience of anomaly detection to malicious measurements has been tested only against arbitrary attacks, which are not necessarily sophisticated. The novel method presented here is based on an optimization algorithm, which maximizes the attack’s chance of staying undetected while causing damage to the application, thus seeking the worst-case scenario for the anomaly detection algorithm. The algorithm is tested on a wildfire monitoring WSN to estimate the benefits of anomaly detection on the system’s resilience. The algorithm also returns the measurements that the attacker needs to synthesize, which are studied to highlight the weak spots of anomaly detection. Finally, this article presents a novel methodology that takes in input the degree of resilience required and automatically designs the deployment that satisfies such a requirement.},

In this paper, we introduce E-Spion, an anomaly-based system level Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for IoT devices. E-Spion profiles IoT devices according to their 'behavior' using system level information, like running process parameters and their system calls, in an autonomous, efficient, and scalable manner. These profiles are then used to detect anomalous behaviors indicative of intrusions. E-Spion provides three layers of detection with increasing detection efficiency but at the same time higher overhead costs on the devices. We have extensively evaluated E-Spion using a comprehensive dataset of 3973 IoT malware samples in our testbed. We observe a detection efficiency ranging from 78% to 100% depending on the layers of detection employed. We provide an analysis and comparison of the different layers of E-Spion in terms of detection accuracy and overhead costs. We also analyze the behavior of the malware samples in terms of our device logs at each layer.},

abstract = {Modern vehicles rely on hundreds of on-board electronic control units (ECUs) communicating over in-vehicle networks. As external interfaces to the car control networks (such as the on-board diagnostic (OBD) port, auxiliary media ports, etc.) become common, and vehicle-to-vehicle / vehicle-to-infrastructure technology is in the near future, the attack surface for vehicles grows, exposing control networks to potentially life-critical attacks. This paper addresses the need for securing the controller area network (CAN) bus by detecting anomalous traffic patterns via unusual refresh rates of certain commands. While previous works have identified signal frequency as an important feature for CAN bus intrusion detection, this paper provides the first such algorithm with experiments using three attacks in five (total) scenarios. Our data-driven anomaly detection algorithm requires only five seconds of training time (on normal data) and achieves true positive / false discovery rates of 0.9998/0.00298, respectively (micro-averaged across the five experimental tests).},

abstract = {Adversarial attacks to Machine Learning (ML) models became such a concern that tech companies (Microsoft and CUJO AI’s Vulnerability Research Lab) decided to launch contests to better understand their impact on practice. During the contest’s first edition (2019), participating teams were challenged to bypass three ML models in a white box manner. Our team bypassed all the three of them and reported interesting insights about models’ weaknesses. In the second edition (2020), the challenge evolved to an attack-and-defense model: the teams should either propose defensive models and attack other teams’ models in a black box manner. Despite the difficulty increase, our team was able to bypass all models again. In this paper, we describe our insights for this year’s contest regarding on attacking models, as well defending them from adversarial attacks. In particular, we show how frequency-based models (e.g., TF-IDF) are vulnerable to the addition of dead function imports, and how models based on raw bytes are vulnerable to payload-embedding obfuscation (e.g., XOR and base64 encoding). },

abstract = {Drive-by download attacks, which exploit vulnerabilities of web browsers to control client computers, have become a major venue for attackers. To detect such attacks, researchers have proposed many approaches such as anomaly-based [22, 23] and vulnerability-based [44, 50] detections. However, anomaly-based approaches are vulnerable to data pollution, and existing vulnerability-based approaches cannot accurately describe the vulnerability condition of all the drive-by download attacks.In this paper, we propose a vulnerability-based approach, namely JShield, which uses novel opcode vulnerability signature, a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) with a variable pool at opcode level, to match drive-by download vulnerabilities. We investigate all the JavaScript engine vulnerabilities of web browsers from 2009 to 2014, as well as those of portable document files (PDF) readers from 2007 to 2014. JShield is able to match all of those vulnerabilities; furthermore, the overall evaluation shows that JShield is so lightweight that it only adds 2.39 percent of overhead to original execution as the median among top 500 Alexa web sites.},

Security systems can be employed in the host or in the network itself as a standalone entity. Host based detection systems can be broadly classified into either anomaly detection or misuse detection. Host based methods are more popular due to the low, cost and processing overhead involved, as compared to other mechanisms like virtualisation based detection. Due to its effectiveness, attackers now manipulate system calls for initiating an attack. Rootkits are the best example of these type of attacks. Kernel level rootkits manipulate system calls by different means to hide its existence. We used host based detection mechanism, where a Linux kernel module is used to extract information from the kernel. Our work proposes an efficient host based detection mechanism using unsupervised learning mechanism in a Linux based system.},

Anti-virus signatures are a simple and fast detection mechanism that can complement more sophisticated analysis strategies. However, if signatures are not designed with care, they can turn from a defensive mechanism into an instrument of attack. In this paper, we present a novel method for automatically deriving signatures from anti-virus software and discuss how the extracted signatures can be used to attack sensible data with the aid of the virus scanner itself. To this end, we study the practicability of our approach using four commercial products and exemplary demonstrate anti-virus assisted attacks in three different scenarios.},

abstract = {As antivirus and network intrusion detection systems have increasingly proven insufficient to detect advanced threats, large security operations centers have moved to deploy endpoint-based sensors that provide deeper visibility into low-level events across their enterprises. Unfortunately, for many organizations in government and industry, the installation, maintenance, and resource requirements of these newer solutions pose barriers to adoption and are perceived as risks to organizations' missions. To mitigate this problem we investigated the utility of agentless detection of malicious endpoint behavior, using only the standard built-in Windows audit logging facility as our signal. We found that Windows audit logs, while emitting manageable sized data streams on the endpoints, provide enough information to allow robust detection of malicious behavior. Audit logs provide an effective, low-cost alternative to deploying additional expensive agent-based breach detection systems in many government and industrial settings, and can be used to detect, in our tests, 83% percent of malware samples with a 0.1% false positive rate. They can also supplement already existing host signature-based antivirus solutions, like Kaspersky, Symantec, and McAfee, detecting, in our testing environment, 78% of malware missed by those antivirus systems.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) perform well in the fields of image recognition, speech recognition, pattern analysis, and intrusion detection. However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples that add a small amount of noise to the original samples. These adversarial examples have mainly been studied in the field of images, but their effect on the audio field is currently of great interest. For example, adding small distortion that is difficult to identify by humans to the original sample can create audio adversarial examples that allow humans to hear without errors, but only to misunderstand the machine. Therefore, a defense method against audio adversarial examples is needed because it is a threat in this audio field. In this paper, we propose a method to detect audio adversarial examples. The key point of this method is to add a new low level distortion using audio modification, so that the classification result of the adversarial example changes sensitively. On the other hand, the original sample has little change in the classification result for low level distortion. Using this feature, we propose a method to detect audio adversarial examples. To verify the proposed method, we used the Mozilla Common Voice dataset and the DeepSpeech model as the target model. Based on the experimental results, it was found that the accuracy of the adversarial example decreased to 6.21% at approximately 12 dB. It can detect the audio adversarial example compared to the initial audio sample.},

abstract = {With the wide adoption, Linux-based IoT devices have emerged as one primary target of today's cyber attacks. Traditional malware-based attacks can quickly spread across these devices, but they are well-understood threats with effective defense techniques such as malware fingerprinting and community-based fingerprint sharing. Recently, fileless attacks---attacks that do not rely on malware files---have been increasing on Linux-based IoT devices, and posing significant threats to the security and privacy of IoT systems. Little has been known in terms of their characteristics and attack vectors, which hinders research and development efforts to defend against them. In this paper, we present our endeavor in understanding fileless attacks on Linux-based IoT devices in the wild. Over a span of twelve months, we deploy 4 hardware IoT honeypots and 108 specially designed software IoT honeypots, and successfully attract a wide variety of real-world IoT attacks. We present our measurement study on these attacks, with a focus on fileless attacks, including the prevalence, exploits, environments, and impacts. Our study further leads to multi-fold insights towards actionable defense strategies that can be adopted by IoT vendors and end users.},

abstract = {The problem of adversarial examples, evasion attacks on machine learning classifiers, has proven extremely difficult to solve. This is true even in the black-box threat model, as is the case in many practical settings. Here, the classifier is hosted as a remote service and the adversary does not have direct access to the model parameters.This paper argues that in such settings, defenders have a larger space of actions than previously studied. Specifically, we deviate from the implicit assumption made by prior work that a defense must be a stateless function that operates on individual examples, and evaluate the space of stateful defenses.We develop a defense designed to detect the process of generating adversarial examples. By keeping a history of the past queries, a defender can try to identify when a sequence of queries appears to be for the purpose of generating an adversarial example. We then introduce query blinding, a new class of attacks designed to bypass defenses that rely on such a defense approach. We believe that expanding the study of adversarial examples from stateless classifiers to stateful systems is not only more realistic for many black-box settings, but also gives the defender a much-needed advantage in responding to the adversary.},

Based on the preliminary studies, we design a novel MAC model incorporating intrusion detection and tracing in a commercial operating system, named Tracer, in order to disable malware on hosts while offering good compatibility to existing software and good usability to common users who are not system experts. The model conceptually consists of three actions: detecting, tracing and restricting suspected intruders. One novelty is that it leverages light-weight intrusion detection and tracing techniques to automate security label configuration that is widely acknowledged as a tough issue when applying a MAC system in practice. The other is that, rather than restricting information flow as a traditional MAC does, it traces intruders and restricts only their critical malware behaviors, where intruders represent processes and executables that are potential agents of a remote attacker. Our prototyping and experiments on Windows show that Tracer can effectively defeat all malware samples tested via blocking malware behaviors while not causing a significant compatibility problem.},

abstract = {Deep learning in a collaborative setting is emerging as a corner-stone of many upcoming applications, wherein untrusted users collaborate to generate more accurate models. From the security perspective, this opens collaborative deep learning to poisoning attacks, wherein adversarial users deliberately alter their inputs to mis-train the model. These attacks are known for machine learning systems in general, but their impact on new deep learning systems is not well-established.We investigate the setting of indirect collaborative deep learning --- a form of practical deep learning wherein users submit masked features rather than direct data. Indirect collaborative deep learning is preferred over direct, because it distributes the cost of computation and can be made privacy-preserving. In this paper, we study the susceptibility of collaborative deep learning systems to adversarial poisoning attacks. Specifically, we obtain the following empirical results on 2 popular datasets for handwritten images (MNIST) and traffic signs (GTSRB) used in auto-driving cars. For collaborative deep learning systems, we demonstrate that the attacks have 99% success rate for misclassifying specific target data while poisoning only 10% of the entire training dataset.As a defense, we propose Auror, a system that detects malicious users and generates an accurate model. The accuracy under the deployed defense on practical datasets is nearly unchanged when operating in the absence of attacks. The accuracy of a model trained using Auror drops by only 3% even when 30% of all the users are adversarial. Auror provides a strong guarantee against evasion; if the attacker tries to evade, its attack effectiveness is bounded.},

abstract = {Governments and other bodies stockpile a significant number of zero-day vulnerabilities for offense. But at the same time, they could also have the incentive to help private and commercial organizations patch these vulnerabilities, yet doing so will leak the zero-days, thus removing their offensive capability. This is an offense-defense trade-off. On the other hand, the private organizations might want to share traffic data with the government for zero-day exploit detection, but may be simultaneously worried about abusive surveillance. In other words, these organizations face a security-privacy trade-off. These dilemmas and their trade-off nature give rise to a new problem of mutually suspicious parties working together.In this paper, we propose an architecture called SeZeDe (Secure Zero-day Detection) which aims at wiping off the above trade-offs with two key underlying technical ideas, one which assures detection and privacy, and one which assures (delayed) accountability against abuse. Specifically, SeZeDe first integrates secure pattern matching with signature-based intrusion detection to protect the data confidentiality of both sides while still supporting main detection functionalities. Second, SeZeDe applies the idea of time-lock encryption to deter turning the detection service into a surveillance mechanism. Our prototype evaluation shows promising detection performance and applicability.},

abstract = {Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems play an important role in monitoring industrial processes such as electric power distribution, transport systems, water distribution, and wastewater collection systems. Such systems require a particular attention with regards to security aspects, as they deal with critical infrastructures that are crucial to organizations and countries. Protecting SCADA systems from intrusion is a very challenging task because they do not only inherit traditional IT security threats but they also include additional vulnerabilities related to field components (e.g., cyber-physical attacks). Many of the existing intrusion detection techniques rely on supervised learning that consists of algorithms that are first trained with reference inputs to learn specific information, and then tested on unseen inputs for classification purposes. This article surveys supervised learning from a specific security angle, namely SCADA-based intrusion detection. Based on a systematic review process, existing literature is categorized and evaluated according to SCADA-specific requirements. Additionally, this survey reports on well-known SCADA datasets and testbeds used with machine learning methods. Finally, we present key challenges and our recommendations for using specific supervised methods for SCADA systems.},

Such a rigid deployment is sometimes necessary, but undermines the flexibility of security services in meeting the demands of emerging applications, such as augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and 5G for industry 4.0, which are provoked by the evolution of connected and smart devices, their heterogeneity, and integration with cloud and edge computing infrastructures.To loosen these rigid security deployments, in this paper, we propose a data-centric SECurity-as-a-Service (SECaaS) framework for elastic deployment and provisioning of security services at the Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) infrastructure. In particular, we discuss three security services that are suitable for edge deployment: (i) an intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS), (ii) an access control enforcement system (ACE), and (iii) a communication anonymization service (CA). We benchmark the common security microservices along with the design and implementation of a proof of concept communication anonymization application.},

abstract = {Many cyber attack actions can be observed, but the observables often exhibit intricate feature dependencies, non-homogeneity, and potentially rare yet critical samples. This work tests the ability to learn, model, and synthesize cyber intrusion alerts through Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which explore the feature space by reconciling between randomly generated samples and data that reflect a mixture of diverse attack behaviors without a priori knowledge. Through a comprehensive analysis using Jensen-Shannon Divergence, Conditional and Joint Entropy, and mode drops and additions, we show that the Wasserstein-GAN with Gradient Penalty and Mutual Information is more effective in learning to generate realistic alerts than models without Mutual Information constraints. We further show that the added Mutual Information constraint pushes the model to explore the feature space more thoroughly and increases the generation of low probability, yet critical, alert features. This research demonstrates the novel and promising application of unsupervised GANs to learn from limited yet diverse intrusion alerts to generate synthetic alerts that emulate critical dependencies, opening the door to proactive, data-driven cyber threat analyses.},

An average vehicle contains million lines of software codes, running on 100 of electronic control units (ECUs), in supporting number of safety, driver assistance and infotainment functions. These ECUs are networked using a Controller Area Network (CAN). Security of the CAN bus has not historically been a major concern, however, recent research demonstrate that CAN has many vulnerabilities to cyber attacks. This paper presents a contextualised anomaly detector for monitoring cyber attacks on the CAN bus. Proposed algorithm is based on message sequence modelling, using so called N-grams distributions. It utilises only benign data (one class) for training and threshold estimation. Performance of the algorithm was tested against two different attack scenarios, RPM and gear gauge messages spoofing, using data captured from a real vehicle. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that proposed algorithm is capable of detecting both attacks with %100 accuracy, using far smaller time windows (100ms) which is essential for a practically deployable automotive cyber security solution.},

abstract = {As smart grid systems become increasingly reliant on networks of control devices, attacks on their inherent security vulnerabilities could lead to catastrophic system failures. Network Intrusion Detection Systems(NIDS) detect such attacks by learning traffic patterns and finding anomalies in them. However, availability of data for robust training and evaluation of NIDS is rare due to associated operational and security risks of sharing such data. Consequently, we present Melody, a scalable framework for synthesizing such datasets. Melody models both, the cyber and physical components of the smart grid by integrating a simulated physical network with an emulated cyber network while using virtual time for high temporal fidelity. We present a systematic approach to generate traffic representing multi-stage attacks, where each stage is either emulated or recreated with a mechanism to replay arbitrary packet traces. We describe and evaluate the suitability of Melodys datasets for intrusion detection, by analyzing the extent to which temporal accuracy of pertinent features is maintained.},

abstract = {The ever-increasing rate of sophisticated cyber-attacks and its subsequent impact on networks has remained a menace to the security community. Existing network security solutions, including those applying machine learning algorithms, often centre their detection on the identification of threats in individual network events, which is proven inadequate in detecting sophisticated multi-stage attacks. Similarly, SOC analysts whose roles involve detecting advanced threats are faced with a significant amount of false-positive alerts from the existing tools. Their ability to detect novel attacks or variants of existing ones is limited by the lack of expert input from SOC analysts in their creation of the tools; and the use of features that are closely linked to the structure of specific malware which detection models aim to identify. In this work, we conduct a literature review on malware detection tools, reflect on the features used in these approaches and extend the feature-set with novel ones identified by interviewing experienced SOC analysts. We conduct thematic analysis to the qualitative data obtained from the interviews, and our results indicate not only the presence novel generic malware characteristics based on network and application events (web proxy, firewall, DNS), but identify valuable lessons for developing effective SOCs regarding their structure and processes.},

abstract = {Deep Convolutional Networks (DCNs) have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples---perturbed inputs specifically designed to produce intentional errors in the learning algorithms at test time. Existing input-agnostic adversarial perturbations exhibit interesting visual patterns that are currently unexplained. In this paper, we introduce a structured approach for generating Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) with procedural noise functions. Our approach unveils the systemic vulnerability of popular DCN models like Inception v3 and YOLO v3, with single noise patterns able to fool a model on up to 90% of the dataset. Procedural noise allows us to generate a distribution of UAPs with high universal evasion rates using only a few parameters. Additionally, we propose Bayesian optimization to efficiently learn procedural noise parameters to construct inexpensive untargeted black-box attacks. We demonstrate that it can achieve an average of less than 10 queries per successful attack, a 100-fold improvement on existing methods. We further motivate the use of input-agnostic defences to increase the stability of models to adversarial perturbations. The universality of our attacks suggests that DCN models may be sensitive to aggregations of low-level class-agnostic features. These findings give insight on the nature of some universal adversarial perturbations and how they could be generated in other applications.},

abstract = {There has been over the past decade a rapid change towards computational environments that are comprised of large and diverse sets of devices, many of them mobile, which can connect in flexible and context-dependent ways. Examples range from networks where we can have communications between powerful cloud centers, to the myriad of simple sensor devices on the IoT. As the management of these dynamic environments becomes ever more complex, we want to propose policy migrations as a methodology to simplify the management of security policies by re-utilizing and re-deploying existing policies as the systems change. We are interested in understanding the challenges raised answering the following question: given a security policy that is being enforced in a particular source computational device, what does it entail to migrate this policy to be enforced in a different target device? Because of the differences between devices and because these devices cannot be seen in isolation but in the context where they are deployed, the meaning of the policy enforced in the source device needs to be re-interpreted and implemented in the context of the target device. The aim of the paper is to present a formal framework to evaluate the appropriateness of the migration.},

abstract = {Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) have been a major challenge in securing both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems. Due to their capability to navigates around defenses and to evade detection for a prolonged period of time, targeted APT attacks present an increasing concern for both cyber security and business continuity personnel. This paper explores the application of Artificial Immune System (AIS) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) variants for APT detection. It has been shown that the variants of the suggested algorithms provide not only detection capability, but can also classify malicious data traffic with respect to the type of APT attacks.},

abstract = {In the last decade, crypto-ransomware evolved from a family of malicious software with scarce repercussion in the research community, to a sophisticated and highly effective intrusion method positioned in the spotlight of the main organizations for cyberdefense. Its modus operandi is characterized by fetching the assets to be blocked, their encryption, and triggering an extortion process that leads the victim to pay for the key that allows their recovery. This paper reviews the evolution of crypto-ransomware focusing on the implication of the different advances in communication technologies that empowered its popularization. In addition, a novel defensive approach based on the Self-Organizing Network paradigm and the emergent communication technologies (e.g. Software-Defined Networking, Network Function Virtualization, Cloud Computing, etc.) is proposed. They enhance the orchestration of smart defensive deployments that adapt to the status of the monitoring environment and facilitate the adoption of previously defined risk management policies. In this way it is possible to efficiently coordinate the efforts of sensors and actuators distributed throughout the protected environment without supervision by human operators, resulting in greater protection with increased viability},

abstract = {Last decade, the speed of wireless data transmission has increased dozens of times, while in the near future a widespread introduction of 5G/5G+ technology is expected which will significantly improve the stability and reliability of inter-device communications in smart cyber infrastructures: Internet of Things (IoT/IIoT), e-hospitals, Factory-of-the-Future (FoF). The presence of high-speed and reliable wireless communications leads to a rapid jump in the creation of modern machine-to-machine smart infrastructures. However, such an environment provides new opportunities for intruders to commit new cyber attacks, e.g. Black hole, Gray hole, massive DDoS, which can lead to serious consequences in dynamic network routing. Researchers thus face the challenge of creating new methods for countering cyber attacks of such kinds. One of the approaches is to apply artificial neural network (ANN). We suggest to utilize the modern ANNs corresponding security tasks in dynamic infrastructures. The paper identifies their major advantages and evaluates the possibility of their application for solving the issue of accurate attacks detection at machine-to-machine (m2m) adhoc self-organizing networks. An assessment is made of the effectiveness of the activation functions and optimization methods to improve accuracy in detecting the network routing attacks. A complex neural framework protecting the m2m-network against attacks on dynamic routing has been discussed, and accuracy of the developed hybrid is estimated. The ensemble of modern ANNs demonstrates 96% accuracy in detecting all types of routing attacks. This neural network complex can be applied to protect smart infrastructures against linkage collapses and network disunity.},

abstract = {Zero-day or unknown malware are created using code obfuscation techniques that can modify the parent code to produce offspring copies which have the same functionality but with different signatures. Current techniques reported in literature lack the capability of detecting zero-day malware with the required accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we have proposed and evaluated a novel method of employing several data mining techniques to detect and classify zero-day malware with high levels of accuracy and efficiency based on the frequency of Windows API calls. This paper describes the methodology employed for the collection of large data sets to train the classifiers, and analyses the performance results of the various data mining algorithms adopted for the study using a fully automated tool developed in this research to conduct the various experimental investigations and evaluation. Through the performance results of these algorithms from our experimental analysis, we are able to evaluate and discuss the advantages of one data mining algorithm over the other for accurately detecting zero-day malware successfully.The data mining framework employed in this research learns through analysing the behavior of existing malicious and benign codes in large datasets. We have employed robust classifiers, namely Na\"{\i}ve Bayes (NB) Algorithm, k--Nearest Neighbor (kNN) Algorithm, Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) Algorithm with 4 differents kernels (SMO - Normalized PolyKernel, SMO -- PolyKernel, SMO -- Puk, and SMO- Radial Basis Function (RBF)), Backpropagation Neural Networks Algorithm, and J48 decision tree and have evaluated their performance.Overall, the automated data mining system implemented for this study has achieved high true positive (TP) rate of more than 98.5%, and low false positive (FP) rate of less than 0.025, which has not been achieved in literature so far. This is much higher than the required commercial acceptance level indicating that our novel technique is a major leap forward in detecting zero-day malware. This paper also offers future directions for researchers in exploring different aspects of obfuscations that are affecting the IT world today.},

Since it's known to the public, XSS vulnerability has been in the TOP 10 Web application vulnerabilities based on surveys published by the Open Web Applications Security Project (OWASP). How to effectively detect and defend XSS attacks are still one of the most important security issues. In this paper, we present a novel approach to detect XSS attacks based on deep learning (called DeepXSS). First of all, we used word2vec to extract the feature of XSS payloads which captures word order information and map each payload to a feature vector. And then, we trained and tested the detection model using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks. Experimental results show that the proposed XSS detection model based on deep learning achieves a precision rate of 99.5% and a recall rate of 97.9% in real dataset, which means that the novel approach can effectively identify XSS attacks.},

abstract = {Cyber threat hunting is the process of proactively and iteratively formulating and validating threat hypotheses based on security-relevant observations and domain knowledge. To facilitate threat hunting tasks, this paper introduces threat intelligence computing as a new methodology that models threat discovery as a graph computation problem. It enables efficient programming for solving threat discovery problems, equipping threat hunters with a suite of potent new tools for agile codifications of threat hypotheses, automated evidence mining, and interactive data inspection capabilities. A concrete realization of a threat intelligence computing platform is presented through the design and implementation of a domain-specific graph language with interactive visualization support and a distributed graph database. The platform was evaluated in a two-week DARPA competition for threat detection on a test bed comprising a wide variety of systems monitored in real time. During this period, sub-billion records were produced, streamed, and analyzed, dozens of threat hunting tasks were dynamically planned and programmed, and attack campaigns with diverse malicious intent were discovered. The platform exhibited strong detection and analytics capabilities coupled with high efficiency, resulting in a leadership position in the competition. Additional evaluations on comprehensive policy reasoning are outlined to demonstrate the versatility of the platform and the expressiveness of the language.},

abstract = {Application markets such as the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store have become the de facto method of distributing software to mobile devices. While official markets dedicate significant resources to detecting malware, state-of-the-art malware detection can be easily circumvented using logic bombs or checks for an emulated environment. We present a Practical Root Exploit Containment (PREC) framework that protects users from such conditional malicious behavior. PREC can dynamically identify system calls from high-risk components (e.g., third-party native libraries) and execute those system calls within isolated threads. Hence, PREC can detect and stop root exploits with high accuracy while imposing low interference to benign applications. We have implemented PREC and evaluated our methodology on 140 most popular benign applications and 10 root exploit malicious applications. Our results show that PREC can successfully detect and stop all the tested malware while reducing the false alarm rates by more than one order of magnitude over traditional malware detection algorithms. PREC is light-weight, which makes it practical for runtime on-device root exploit detection and containment.},

Program behavior is captured in terms of issued system calls augmented with point-of-system-call information, and is modeled according to an efficient deterministic pushdown automaton (DPDA). The frequency of visit of each state is captured and statistically analyzed to detect abnormal execution patterns. This approach provides a very accurate learning of program behavior, which avoids a broad class of impossible path exploits. It also allows detection of new classes of attacks such as denial-of-service and brute-force dictionary attacks. We also present a complexity analysis of our model, and show that its time and space complexity is polynomial and fairly comparable to other similar approaches in learning, and hugely better in detection. Moreover, We evaluate our approach experimentally in terms of false positive rate, convergence rate, and performance. Finally, We shall discuss classes of attacks which are detectable and undetectable by our approach.},

Such detectors are then evaluated using data generated from an operational plant or a simulator; rarely is the assessment conducted in real time on a live plant. Regardless of the method to create an anomaly detector, and the data used for performance evaluation, there remain significant challenges that ought to be overcome before such detectors can be deployed with confidence in city-scale plants or large electric power grids.

This study investigates the potential applications of Adversarial Audio through the BackDoor system to manipulate voice-enabled devices, or VEDs, without detection by humans or other nearby microphones. We discreetly transmit voice commands by applying robust, noise-resistant adversarial audio perturbations through BackDoor on top of a predetermined speech or music base sample to achieve a desired target transcription. Our analysis compares differing base carriers, target phrases, and perturbation strengths for maximal effectiveness through BackDoor. We determined that such an attack is feasible and that the desired adversarial properties of the audio sample are maintained even when transmitted through BackDoor.},

abstract = {Understanding the behaviors of, and evading state-level Internet-scale censorship systems such as the Great Firewall (GFW) of China, has emerged as a research problem of great interest. One line of evasion is the development of techniques that leverage the possibility that the TCP state maintained on the GFW may not represent the state at end-hosts. In this paper we undertake, arguably, the most extensive measurement study on TCP-level GFW evasion techniques, with several vantage points within and outside China, and with clients subscribed to multiple ISPs. We find that the state-of-the art evasion techniques are no longer very effective on the GFW. Our study further reveals that the primary reason that causes these failures is the evolution of GFW over time. In addition, other factors such as the presence of middleboxes on the route from the client to the server also contribute to previously unexpected behaviors.Our measurement study leads us to new understandings of the GFW and new evasion techniques. Evaluations of our new evasion strategies show that our new techniques provide much higher success rates of (compared to prior schemes) ≈ 90% or higher. Our results further validate our new understandings of the GFW's evolved behaviors. We also develop a measurement-driven tool INTANG, that systematically looks for and finds the best strategy that works with a server and network path. Our measurements show that INTANG can yield near perfect evasion rates and is extremely effective in aiding various protocols such as HTTP, DNS over TCP, and Tor in evading the GFW.},

We generate adversarial examples by modifying the malware’s API call sequences and non-sequential features (printable strings), and these adversarial examples will be misclassified by the target malware classifier without affecting the malware’s functionality. In contrast to previous studies, our attack minimizes the number of malware classifier queries required. In addition, in our attack, the attacker must only know the class predicted by the malware classifier; attacker knowledge of the malware classifier’s confidence score is optional. We evaluate the attack effectiveness when attacks are performed against a variety of malware classifier architectures, including recurrent neural network (RNN) variants, deep neural networks, support vector machines, and gradient boosted decision trees. Our attack success rate is around 98% when the classifier’s confidence score is known and 64% when just the classifier’s predicted class is known. We implement four state-of-the-art query-efficient attacks and show that our attack requires fewer queries and less knowledge about the attacked model’s architecture than other existing query-efficient attacks, making it practical for attacking cloud-based malware classifiers at a minimal cost.},

Such systems historically identify URLs by means of regular expressions, even if machine learning alternatives have been proposed to overcome the time-consuming maintenance of classification rules. Classical machine learning algorithms, however, require large samples of URLs to train the models, covering the diverse classes of URLs (i.e., a ground truth), which somehow limits the applicability of the approach. We here give a first step towards the use of Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs) to classify URLs. GANs are attractive for this problem for two reasons. First, GANs can produce samples of URLs belonging to specific classes even if exposed to a limited training set, outputting both synthetic traces and a robust discriminator. Second, a GAN can be trained to discriminate a class of URLs without being exposed to all other URLs classes - i.e., GANs are robust even if not exposed to uninteresting URL classes during training. Experiments on real data show that not only the generated synthetic traces are somehow realistic, but also the URL classification is accurate with GANs.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become ubiquitous and spread across many application domains including the industry, transportation, healthcare, and households. However, the proliferation of the IoT devices has raised the concerns about their security -- many manufacturers focus only on the core functionality of their products due to short time to market and low cost pressures, while neglecting security aspects. Moreover, there is no established or standardized method for measuring and ensuring the security of IoT devices. Consequently, vulnerabilities are left untreated, allowing attackers to exploit IoT devices for various purposes, such as compromising privacy, recruiting devices into a botnet, or misusing devices to perform cryptocurrency mining. In this paper, we present a practical Host-based Anomaly DEtec­tion System for IoT (HADES-IoT) as a novel last line of defense. HADES-IoT has proactive detection capabilities, provides tamper-proof resistance, and can be deployed on a wide range of Linux-based IoT devices. The main advantage of HADES-IoT is its low performance overhead, which makes it suitable for the IoT domain, where state-of-the-art approaches cannot be applied due to their high-performance demands. We deployed HADES-IoT on seven IoT devices and demonstrated 100% effectiveness in the detection of current IoT malware such as VPNFilter and IoTReaper; while on average, requiring only 5.5% of available memory and causing only a low CPU load.},

abstract = {Denial of Service (DoS)/ DDoS attack is a common and severe problem for network security researchers and practitioners. Attackers often generate attack traffic that behaves similar to normal network traffic using sophisticated attacking tools. Many intrusion detection systems fail to detect anomalous packets in real time. In this paper, we use a Multivariate Correlation Analysis (MCA) approach to distinguish attack traffic from normal traffic. This statistical measure is used to analyze the behavior of network traffic for attack detection. Since DDoS attack traffic behaves differently from legitimate network traffic, statistical properties of various parameters reflect the changed behavior of network traffic. We extract three basic parameters of network traffic, viz., entropy of source IPs, variation of source IPs and packet rate to analyze the behavior of network traffic during attack detection. The method is validated using several benchmark datasets.},

abstract = {The Internet of things (IoT) is rapidly emerging with the goal to connect the unconnected. Many new device manufacturers are entering the market of internet-connected appliances for smart homes and offices, ranging from motion sensors to virtual voice assistants. However, due to lack of security by design and flawed implementations we are facing significant security and privacy challenges specific to IoT, such as perilous IoT botnet attacks, and novel privacy threats caused by widespread installation of wireless sensors, actuators and smart home appliances even in the private setting of our homes. Unfortunately, basic security measures like properly encrypted communications does not protect against these threats. The massive scale of the IoT device population and enormous diversity of device hardware, operating systems, software frameworks and manufacturers makes it very difficult to establish standard IoT security and privacy-protecting solutions by simply applying known solutions, neither for per-device security architectures nor for network security measures. In particular, existing intrusion detection techniques to detect compromised IoT devices seem ineffective. In this talk, we will present our recent work on addressing various security and privacy challenges in the growing IoT landscape including industry collaborations. In particular, we focus on approaches for flexible management of security associations (pairing) among devices introduced into the user's trust domain as well as effectively and efficiently identifying these devices based on their inherent communication behavior and using these behavior patterns to automatically and reliably detect compromised IoT devices.},

To address the weaknesses of existing fuzzers or to apply them into different scenarios, researchers have proposed various solutions to the problem. In order to apply fuzzing, a technique with excellent performance in vulnerability discovery, to kernel vulnerability discovery, security researchers have come up with a number of effective and efficient solutions. This paper aims to discuss the application of fuzzing in operating systems kernel. First, we introduce popular the concept of kernel vulnerability and the importance of kernel vulnerability discovery. Second, we discuss the development and classification of fuzzing technology.

It has become common practice to deploy web applications in containers like Docker for better portability and ease of deployment. We design a system called AppMine for lightweight monitoring of web applications running in Docker containers and detection of unknown web vulnerabilities. AppMine is an unsupervised learning system, trained only on legitimate workloads of web applications, to detect anomalies based on either traditional models (PCA and one-class SVM), or more advanced neural-network architectures (LSTM). In our evaluation, we demonstrate that the neural network model outperforms more traditional methods on a range of web applications and recreated exploits. For instance, AppMine achieves average AUC scores as high as 0.97 for the Apache Struts application (with the CVE-2017-5638 exploit used in the Equifax breach), while the AUC scores for PCA and one-class SVM are 0.81 and 0.83, respectively.},

abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) methods have been widely used in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). In particular, many botnet detection methods are based on ML. However, due to the fast-evolving nature of network security threats, it is necessary to frequently retrain the ML tools with up-to-date data, especially because data labeling takes a long time and requires a lot of effort, making it difficult to generate training data. We propose transfer learning as a more effective approach for botnet detection, as it can learn from well curated source data and transfer the knowledge to a target problem domain not seen before. We devise an approach that is effective regardless whether or not the data from the target domain is labeled. More specifically, we train a neural network with the Recurrrent Variation Autoencoder (RVAE) structure on the source data, and use RVAE to compute anomaly scores for data records from the target domain. In an evaluation of this transfer learning framework, we use CTU-13 dataset as a source domain and a fresh set of network monitoring data as a target domain. Tests show that the proposed transfer learning method is able to detect botnets better than semi-supervised learning method that was trained on the target domain data. The area under Receiver Operating Characteristic is 0.810 for transfer learning, and 0.779 for directly using RVAE on the target domain data.},

abstract = {Economic incentives encourage malware authors to constantly develop new, increasingly complex malware to steal sensitive data or blackmail individuals and companies into paying large ransoms. In 2017, the worldwide economic impact of cyberattacks is estimated to be between 445 and 600 billion USD, or 0.8% of global GDP. Traditionally, one of the approaches used to defend against malware is network traffic analysis, which relies on network data to detect the presence of potentially malicious software. However, to keep up with increasing network speeds and amount of traffic, network analysis is generally limited to work on aggregated network data, which is traditionally challenging and yields mixed results. In this paper we present MalPhase, a system that was designed to cope with the limitations of aggregated flows. MalPhase features a multi-phase pipeline for malware detection, type and family classification. The use of an extended set of network flow features and a simultaneous multi-tier architecture facilitates a performance improvement for deep learning models, making them able to detect malicious flows (&gt;98% F1) and categorize them to a respective malware type (&gt;93% F1) and family (&gt;91% F1). Furthermore, the use of robust features and denoising autoencoders allows MalPhase to perform well on samples with varying amounts of benign traffic mixed in. Finally, MalPhase detects unseen malware samples with performance comparable to that of known samples, even when interlaced with benign flows to reflect realistic network environments.},

These works gather traces of HPCs for a variety of applications (both malicious and non-malicious) and then apply machine learning to train a detector to distinguish between benign applications and malware. In this work, we provide a more comprehensive analysis of the applicability of using machine learning and HPCs for a specific subset of malware: kernel rootkits.We design five synthetic rootkits, each providing a single piece of rootkit functionality, and execute each while collecting HPC traces of its impact on a specific benchmark application. We then apply machine learning feature selection techniques in order to determine the most relevant HPCs for the detection of these rootkits. We identify 16 HPCs that are useful for the detection of hooking based roots, and also find that rootkits employing direct kernel object manipulation (DKOM) do not significantly impact HPCs. We then use these synthetic rootkit traces to train a detection system capable of detecting new rootkits it has not seen previously with an accuracy of over 99%. Our results indicate that HPCs have the potential to be an effective tool for rootkit detection, even against new rootkits not previously seen by the detector.},

abstract = {Networks play a central role in cyber-security: networks deliver security attacks, suffer from them, defend against them, and sometimes even cause them. This article is a concise tutorial on the large subject of networks and security, written for all those interested in networking, whether their specialty is security or not. To achieve this goal, we derive our focus and organization from two perspectives. The first perspective is that, although mechanisms for network security are extremely diverse, they are all instances of a few patterns. Consequently, after a pragmatic classification of security attacks, the main sections of the tutorial cover the four patterns for providing network security, of which the familiar three are cryptographic protocols, packet filtering, and dynamic resource allocation. Although cryptographic protocols hide the data contents of packets, they cannot hide packet headers. When users need to hide packet headers from adversaries, which may include the network from which they are receiving service, they must resort to the pattern of compound sessions and overlays. The second perspective comes from the observation that security mechanisms interact in important ways, with each other and with other aspects of networking, so each pattern includes a discussion of its interactions.},

However, as an experimental discipline, reproducible cyber experimentation is essential to assure valid, unbiased results. Even minor differences in setup, configuration, and testbed components can have an impact on the experiments, and thus, reproducibility of results. This paper documents a case study in reproducing an earlier emulation study, with the reproduced emulation experiment conducted by a different research group on a different testbed. We describe lessons learned as a result of this process, both in terms of the reproducibility of the original study and in terms of the different testbed technologies used by both groups. This paper also addresses the question of how to compare results between two groups’ experiments, identifying candidate metrics for comparison and quantifying the results in this reproduction study.},

abstract = {Although network intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been studied for several years, their operators are still overwhelmed by a large number of false-positive alerts. In this work we study the following problem: from a large archive of intrusion alerts collected in a production network, we want to detect with a small number of false positives hosts within the network that have been infected by malware. Solving this problem is essential not only for reducing the false-positive rate of IDSs, but also for labeling traces collected in the wild with information about validated security incidents. We use a 9-month long dataset of IDS alerts and we first build a novel heuristic to detect infected hosts from the on average 3 million alerts we observe per day. Our heuristic uses a statistical measure to find hosts that exhibit a repeated multi-stage malicious footprint involving specific classes of alerts. A significant part of our work is devoted to the validation of our heuristic. We conduct a complex experiment to assess the security of suspected infected systems in a production environment using data from several independent sources, including intrusion alerts, blacklists, host scanning logs, vulnerability reports, and search engine queries. We find that the false positive rate of our heuristic is 15% and analyze in-depth the root causes of the false positives. Having validated our heuristic, we apply it to our entire trace, and characterize various important properties of 9 thousand infected hosts in total. For example, we find that among the infected hosts, a small number of heavy hitters originate most outbound attacks and that future infections are more likely to occur close to already infected hosts.},

To evaluate our approach we produced a new dataset consisting of more than 300 Bluetooth network traces collected from 20 Bluetooth-enabled smart-health and smart-home devices.

The variants are designed to behave identically during normal operation and differently during an attack. When different behavior (divergence) is detected, N-variant systems self-heal by either rolling back to a safe state or restarting. Unfortunately, an attacker can create a denial-of-service (DoS) attack from a diverging input by using it to force an N-variant system into an endless diverge/restart cycle. This paper describes a defense, CRISPR-Inspired Program Resiliency (Crispy), that automatically protects N-variant systems from such DoS attacks. Crispy mitigates DoS attacks against N-variant systems using an automatic signature generation technique modeled on CRISPR/Cas, the bacterial adaptive immune system. Experiments on two webservers using exploits developed by an independent Red Team showed Crispy protected against 87.5% of DoS attacks with zero false positives. Overhead was minimal and varied according to the number of signatures maintained, which can be tailored to the threat model and performance requirements.},

abstract = { The increasing diffusion of malware endowed with steganographic and cloaking capabilities requires tools and techniques for conducting research activities, testing real deployments and elaborating mitigation mechanisms. To investigate attacks targeting network and appliances, a core requirement concerns the availability of suitable traffic traces, which can be used to derive mathematical models for simulation or to develop machine-learning-based countermeasures. Unfortunately, the young nature of threats injecting secrets or cloaking their presence within network traffic, the high protocol-dependent nature of the various embedding processes, and privacy issues, prevent the vast diffusion of datasets to perform research. Therefore, in this paper we present pcapStego, a tool for creating network covert channels within .pcap files. This approach has two major advantages: it allows to prepare large datasets starting from real network traces, and it generates “replayable” conversations useful for both emulating attacks or conduct pentesting campaigns. To prove the effectiveness of the tool, we showcase the generation of network covert channels targeting IPv6 traffic, which is gaining momentum and it is expected to be a major target for future attacks.},

abstract = {Cooperative spectrum sensing aims to improve the reliability of spectrum sensing by individual sensors for better utilization of the scarce spectrum bands, which gives the feasibility for secondary spectrum users to transmit their signals when primary users remain idle. However, there are various vulnerabilities experienced in cooperative spectrum sensing, especially when machine learning techniques are applied. The influence-limiting defense is proposed as a method to defend the data fusion center when a small number of spectrum sensing devices is controlled by an intelligent attacker to send erroneous sensing results. Nonetheless, this defense suffers from a computational complexity problem. In this paper, we propose a low-cost version of the influence-limiting defense and demonstrate that it can decrease the computation cost significantly (the time cost is reduced to less than 20% of the original defense) while still maintaining the same level of defense performance.},

Our approach represents all HTTP communications between clients and servers as a weighted, near-bipartite graph, where the nodes correspond to the IP addresses of clients and servers while the links are their interconnections, weighted according to the output of a flow-based classifier. We employ a two-phase alternating score propagation algorithm on the graph to identify suspicious clients in a monitored network. Using a symmetrized weighted adjacency matrix as its input, we show that our score propagation algorithm is less vulnerable towards inflating the malicious scores of popular Web servers with high in-degrees compared to the normalization used in PageRank, a widely used graph-based method. Experimental results on a 4-hour network trace collected by a large Internet service provider showed that incorporating flow information into score propagation significantly improves the precision of the algorithm.},

abstract = {Since the first Graphical User Interface (GUI) prototype was invented in the 1970s, GUI systems have been deployed into various personal computer systems and server platforms. Recently, with the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, malicious malware powered by AI is emerging as a potential threat to GUI systems. This type of AI-based cybersecurity attack, targeting at GUI systems, is explored in this paper. It is twofold: (1) A malware is designed to attack the existing GUI system by using AI-based object recognition techniques. (2) Its defensive methods are discovered by generating adversarial examples and other methods to alleviate the threats from the intelligent GUI attack. The results have shown that a generic GUI attack can be implemented and performed in a simple way based on current AI techniques and its countermeasures are temporary but effective to mitigate the threats of GUI attack so far.},

abstract = {Software security is becoming a key quality concern as software applications are increasingly being used in untrustworthy computing environments such as the internet. Software is designed with the mindset of its functionalities and cost, where the focus is on the operational behavior while security concerns are neglected or marginally considered. As a result, software engineers build the software while lacking the knowledge about security and its effect on the system. This paper presents an approach for modeling the behavior of security threats using statecharts. The proposed approach introduces modular design for representing threats through the use of components and reusability. Through the focus on the behavior of an attack, software engineers can clearly define and understand security concerns as the application is being designed and developed. In addition, modeling security threats with statecharts makes it convenient to build a consistent semantic link between functional behaviors and security concerns.},

abstract = {The arrival of smart grid technologies has enabled the implementation of advanced grid control applications aimed at improving overall grid reliability and operational efficiency. The new controls are supported by advanced digital devices and communication networks that often possess inherent vulnerabilities, exposing the grid infrastructure to threat actors. Transactive control is one such smart grid application, wherein active participation of end-use customers in electricity markets is enabled by providing the flexibility to consume energy based on the dynamic price of power. Manipulation of signals exchanged in this control system will diminish the benefits of the application, thereby highlighting the need for control system cybersecurity. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach to building bad-data detection algorithms for transactive control security. Specifically, our solution characterizes end-user market participation using clustering techniques to create a baseline for normal system operation. We then show the application of these clusters to detect malicious behavior during real-time system operation. Our initial results show the promise this approach has towards enhancing the security of transactive control systems.},

Since most of the SSL traffic is unreadable ciphertext, traditional pattern recognition and deep packet inspection are not applicable. In addition, the current machine learning methods are not fully applicable to encrypted traffic detection. The detection of encrypted malicious traffic is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose an SSL malicious traffic detection method based on multi-view features. Our method comprehensively extracts features from multiple views, including flow statistics, SSL handshake field, and certificate to retain key original information. We test four machine learning models, i.e., SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost on the CTU Malware dataset. The results show that XGBoost performs best reaching an accuracy of 97.71%, which is better than other studies on the CTU dataset.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems are widely used in critical infrastructures such as the power grids, water purification systems, nuclear plants, oil refinery and compressor plants, food manufacturing, etc. Anomalies in these systems can be a result of cybersecurity attacks, failed sensors or communication channels. Undetected anomalies may lead to process failure, cause financial damage and have significant impact on human lives. Thus, it is important to detect anomalies at early stages and to protect data in Cyber-Physical Systems. In this paper, we propose the novel on-the-fly NIST-compliant key generation scheme for a secure data container used to transfer and store sensor data. The data container delivers data from the low-level field sensors to high-level data analysis servers in a protected form. It provides data confidentiality and integrity, as well as data origin integrity, a fine-grained role-based and attribute-based access control. As a result, the anomaly detector runs on trustworthy data sets, protected from unauthorized adversarial modifications. Our solution can be easily integrated with many existing Cyber-Physical Systems and IT infrastructures since our secure data container supports RESTful API and is implemented in two modifications: (1) signed, watermarked and encrypted spreadsheet file; (2) signed and encrypted JSON file. In addition, we implemented several machine learning models based on a Random Forest, a k-Nearest Neighbors, a Support Vector Machine and a Neural Network algorithms for the detection of various anomalies and attacks in a gas pipeline system. We will demonstrate that our anomaly detection models achieve high detection rate with an average accuracy of 97.7% for two industrial data sets collected by the Mississippi State University's Critical Infrastructure Protection Center and Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL)},

abstract = {Insider attacks are one of the most dangerous threats to an organization. Unfortunately, they are very difficult to foresee, detect, and defend against due to the trust and responsibilities placed on the employees. In this article, we first define the notion of user intent and construct a model for a common scenario that poses a very high risk for sensitive data stored in the organization’s database. We show that the complexity of identifying pseudo-intents of a user in this scenario is coNP-Complete, and launching a harvester insider attack within the boundaries of the defined threat model takes linear time while a targeted threat model is an NP-Complete problem. We also discuss the general defense mechanisms against the modeled threats and show that countering the harvester insider attack takes quadratic time while countering the targeted insider attack can take linear to quadratic time, depending on the strategy chosen. We analyze the adversarial behavior and show that launching an attack with minimum risk is also an NP-Complete problem. Finally, we perform timing experiments with the defense mechanisms on SQL query workloads collected from a national bank to test the feasibility of using these systems in real time.},

DNS tunneling is a common technique hackers use to establish command and control nodes and to exfiltrate data from networks. To generate the training data sufficient to build models to detect DNS tunneling activity, a penetration testing effort was employed. We extracted features from this data and trained random forest classifiers to distinguish normal DNS activity from tunneling activity. The classifiers successfully detected the presence of tunnels we trained on, and four other types of tunnels that were not a part of the training set.},

Because these artifacts could damage systems or reveal personally identifiable information about the users affected by cyber attacks, publicly disseminating such a benchmark raises several scientific, ethical and legal challenges. We propose the Worldwide Intelligence Network Environment (WINE), a security-benchmarking approach based on rigorous experimental methods. WINE includes representative field data, collected worldwide from 240,000 sensors, for new empirical studies, and it will enable the validation of research on all the phases in the lifecycle of security threats. We tackle the key challenges for security benchmarking by designing a platform for repeatable experimentation on the WINE data sets and by collecting the metadata required for understanding the results. In this paper, we review the unique characteristics of the WINE data, we discuss why rigorous benchmarking will provide fresh insights on the security arms race and we propose a research agenda for this area.},

The workshop's aim is to advance research at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, privacy and security. In particular, AISec gives researchers and practitioners working within one or more of those fields a platform for interdisciplinary discussion, which would otherwise be lacking. Hopefully, the workshop will lead to the initiation of knew col- laborations between groups working across these areas. The papers to be presented in this year's program include topics such as the analysis of privacy, adversarial learning models, intrusion detection and automatic advertisement filtering. We are delighted to again be co-located with the premier ACM Computer and Communication Security (CCS 2014) conference. This year we had 23 submissions from Asia, Europe and North America. This year, the workshop also includes a "presentation-only" track, for papers appearing elsewhere. After a rigorous reviewing process, 11 original papers were accepted for presentation at the workshop, while one paper was accepted for peresentation only.Organizing AISec 2014 was a team effort made possible by colleagues from institutions around the world. We sincerely thank the AISec program committee and external reviewers for their invaluable efforts towards guaranteeing a strong program, and the authors of papers who provided us with such excellent material. Their high caliber submissions and the thoughtful feedback from the reviewers continue to ensure the success of the ACM AISec workshop series. Finally, we wish to thank the ACM CCS organizers, for providing us with a suitable forum and for their continued support of this workshop. We believe that the workshop program will be interesting not only for researchers working in the field, but also for practitioners and academics in other areas in security. We look forward to seeing you all in Scottsdale, Arizona this year.},

abstract = {Advanced attackers have become more sophisticated in their target selection, evasion of detection and monetization of breached data. Cyber deception is used for gathering information about botnets and spreading worms, and to detect persistent external attackers hidden into the systems as well as insider threats. Decoys are resources that should not be normally accessed. They raise alerts and provide information when systems have been compromised. Decoys can be used for learning about automated malicious tools and behavior of the adversaries, as well as to slow down the attacks.This paper tries to solve the following challenges. Deception tools usually raise only certain severity level alerts, which have been selected manually or hard coded into implementations. This means that telling the difference in severity between two alerts coming from different decoys may be difficult. However, on the other hand the second challenge is that alerts coming from decoys may tell too much information for malicious administrators (insider threats). In fact, many times it would be not necessary to tell the type or actual location of decoys at all. Third challenge is difficulty of monitoring the attack phases during time.For giving solutions for all three challenges, this paper proposes an automated categorization for severity of information coming from decoys. The proposed categorization can be used together with existing cyber security deception tools (such as honeypots, honeynets or honeytokens) to provide addition information for alerts. The categorization uses a decoy severity level, which is calculated from the criticality of locations of the actual decoy, a bait leading to it and a key enabling the access to the bait or the decoy. Usually external attacks start against the easiest targets, but insider threat may in fact access the most critical information right away. In addition to this, presented categorization wants to improve the situational awareness by giving more information for measuring the level of the adversaries in advanced targeted attacks, and thus helping with the third challenge.The proposed approach and categorization have been tested with propotype including a combination of webpage type of honeytokens, URL type of baits leading to them, and encryption keys and user credentials enabling access to the baits. Two different implementation approaches have been demonstrated.The results show that combining additional severity measurement information together with security alerts indeed improves the situational awareness. The results of the research can be used to improve existing deception tools and ways of logging of events, or to create new deception tools, as well as to improve information that would be shown in various visualization tools.},

In order to achieve this, we explore the use of three flow exporters, namely Argus, DoHlyzer and Tranalyzer2 to extract flow statistical features. We then augment these features using different ways of calculating the entropy of a flow. To this end, we investigate three entropy calculation approaches: Entropy over all packets of a flow, Entropy over the first 96 bytes of a flow, and Entropy over the first n-packets of a flow. We evaluate five machine learning classifiers, namely Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes using these features in order to identify malicious behaviours in different publicly available datasets. The evaluations show that the Decision Tree classifier achieves an F-measure of 99.7% when flow statistical features are augmented with entropy of a flow calculated over the first 4 packets.},

abstract = {Malware writers are constantly looking for new vulnerabilities to exploit in popular software applications. A successful exploit of a previously unknown vulnerability, that evades state-of-the art anti-virus and intrusion-detection systems is called a zero-day vulnerability. JavaScript is a popular vehicle for testing and delivering attacks through drive-by downloads on web clients. Failed attack attempts leave traces of suspicious activity on victim machines. We present ZDVUE, a tool for automatic prioritization of suspicious JavaScript traces, which can lead to early detection of potential zero-day vulnerabilities. Our algorithm uses a combination of correlation analysis and mixture modeling for fast and robust prioritization of suspicious JavaScript samples.On data collected between June and November 2009, ZDVUE identified a new zero-day vulnerability and its variant in its top results, as well as revealed many new anti-virus signatures. ZDVUE is used in our organization on a routine basis to automatically filter, analyze, and prioritize thousands of downloaded JavaScript files, for information to update anti-virus signatures and to find new zero-day vulnerabilities.},

abstract = {The orthodox paradigm to defend against automated social-engineering attacks in large-scale socio-technical systems is reactive and victim-agnostic. Defenses generally focus on identifying the attacks/attackers (e.g., phishing emails, social-bot infiltrations, malware offered for download). To change the status quo, we propose to identify, even if imperfectly, the vulnerable user population, that is, the users that are likely to fall victim to such attacks. Once identified, information about the vulnerable population can be used in two ways. First, the vulnerable population can be influenced by the defender through several means including: education, specialized user experience, extra protection layers and watchdogs. In the same vein, information about the vulnerable population can ultimately be used to fine-tune and reprioritize defense mechanisms to offer differentiated protection, possibly at the cost of additional friction generated by the defense mechanism. Secondly, information about the user population can be used to identify an attack (or compromised users) based on differences between the general and the vulnerable population. This paper considers the implications of the proposed paradigm on existing defenses in three areas (phishing of user credentials, malware distribution and socialbot infiltration) and discusses how using knowledge of the vulnerable population can enable more robust defenses.},

abstract = {Sensors are tiny devices with limited power (generally a battery for the full sensor lifetime) and reduced computing resources and memory. WSN are deployed for many applications like environment monitoring and health monitoring. In order to reduce the energy consumption and increase the WSN life, adapted network protocols like routing and data aggregation are used. The scheduling of the communications also allow better management of active/idle status and hence optimize the energy consumption. Classical data compression and decompression algorithms are not adapted to WSN as requiring high memory and computation resources. Compressed sensing is an emerging method with practical results in fields like medical imaging. The adoption of compressed sensing in WSN is attracting many research efforts [1234]. Ensuring data security is a key challenge for sensitive applications like health and military. We have used Homomorphic encryption to protect data confidentiality with low energy consumption.},

Under this model, we propose two iterative reinforcement learning algorithms which allow the defender to identify optimal defenses when the information about the attacker is limited. With probability one, the adaptive reinforcement learning algorithm converges to the best response with respect to the attacks when the attacker diminishingly explores the system. With a probability arbitrarily close to one, the robust reinforcement learning algorithm converges to the min-max strategy despite that the attacker persistently explores the system. The algorithm convergence is formally proven and the algorithm performance is verified via numerical simulations.},

abstract = {Data represent an extremely important asset for any organization. Confidential data such as military secrets or intellectual property must never be disclosed outside the organization. Therefore, one of the most severe threats in the case of cyber-insider attacks is the loss of confidential data due to exfiltration. A malicious insider who has the proper credentials to access the organization databases may, over time, send data outside the organization network through a variety of channels, such as email, crafted HTTP requests that encapsulate data, etc. Existing security tools for detection of cyber-attacks focus on protecting the boundary between the organization and the outside world. Numerous network-level intrusion detection systems (IDS) exist, which monitor the traffic pattern and attempt to infer anomalous behavior. While such tools may be effective in protecting against external attacks, they are less suitable when the data exfiltration is performed by an insider who has the proper credentials and authorization to access resources within the organization. In this paper, we argue that DBMS-layer detection and prevention systems are the best alternative to defend against data exfiltration because: (1) DBMS access is performed through a standard, unique language (SQL) with well-understood semantics; (2) monitoring the potential disclosure of confidential data is more effective if done as close as possible to the data source; and (3) the DBMS layer already has in place a thorough mechanism for enforcing access control based on subject credentials. By analyzing the pattern of interaction between subjects and the DBMS, it is possible to detect anomalous activity that is indicative of early signs of exfiltration. In the paper, we outline a taxonomy of cyber-insider dimensions of activities that are indicative of data exfiltration, and we discuss a high-level architecture and mechanisms for early detection of exfiltration by insiders. We also outline a virtualization-based mechanism that prevents insiders from exfiltrating data, even in the case when they manage to gain control over the network. The protection mechanism relies on explicit authorization of data transfers that cross the organizational boundary.},

abstract = {Machine-learning-based anomaly detection systems can be vulnerable to new kinds of deceptions, known as training attacks, which exploit the live learning mechanism of these systems by progressively injecting small portions of abnormal data. The injected data seamlessly swift the learned states to a point where harmful data can pass unnoticed. We focus on the systematic testing of these attacks in the context of intrusion detection systems (IDS). We propose a search-based approach to test IDS by making training attacks. Going a step further, we also propose searching for countermeasures, learning from the successful attacks and thereby increasing the resilience of the tested IDS. We evaluate our approach on a denial-of-service attack detection scenario and a dataset recording the network traffic of a real-world system. Our experiments show that our search-based attack scheme generates successful attacks bypassing the current state-of-the-art defences. We also show that our approach is capable of generating attack patterns for all configuration states of the studied IDS and that it is capable of providing appropriate countermeasures. By co-evolving our attack and defence mechanisms we succeeded at improving the defence of the IDS under test by making it resilient to 49 out of 50 independently generated attacks.},

abstract = {Honeypots are decoy cyberdefense systems placed in a network to entice malicious entities into attacking in order to waste attacker resources and learn information about attack behavior or previously unknown exploits. We focus on the strategic selection of various honeypot configurations in order to adapt to an intelligent attacker amidst a dynamic environment. In order to infiltrate networks, attackers leverage various exploits on the system. However, these exploits and the value they provide dynamically change over time as more information is gathered about them. We introduce a model that addresses the combinatorial complexity of the honeypot selection problem and allow for these dynamic exploits. To solve this new problem, we map this model to a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem, which is a class of machine learning problems that maintain balance between exploration and exploitation. We show empirically that both stochastic and adversarial MAB solutions improve over static defense strategies.},

abstract = {Based on the observations that spy-on-user attacks by calling Android APIs will be detected out by Android API auditing, we studied the possibility of a "transplantation attack", through which a malicious app can take privacy-harming pictures to spy on users without the Android API auditing being aware of it. Usually, to take a picture, apps need to call APIs of Android Camera Service which runs in mediaserver process. Transplantation attack is to transplant the picture taking code from mediaserver process to a malicious app process, and the malicious app can call this code to take a picture in its own address space without any IPC. As a result, the API auditing can be evaded. Our experiments confirm that transplantation attack indeed exists. Also, the transplantation attack makes the spy-on-user attack much more stealthy. The evaluation result shows that nearly a half of 69 smartphones (manufactured by 8 vendors) tested let the transplantation attack discovered by us succeed. Moreover, the attack can evade 7 Antivirus detectors, and Android Device Administration which is a set of APIs that can be used to carry out mobile device management in enterprise environments. The transplantation attack inspires us to uncover a subtle design/implementation deficiency of the Android security.},

Network traffic can be notoriously complicated and prone to fluctuations. With the prevailing risk of cybersecurity breaches, improving the detection algorithms is of utmost importance. Advanced systems using various facets of artificial intelligence and machine learning exist. We look forward to Granular Computing (GrC) as a novel, promising way to improve network traffic classification, intrusion detection and reduction in the computational cost of real time traffic analysis. In this paper, aquick primer on granular computing is offered, its properties of abstracting data into meaningful, compact packages named granules are looked into. The basic principles of granule creation are explained. Consecutively, a survey of the most recent Granular Computing implementations is presented, with analysis of how certain aspects of Granular Computing are utilized to solve particular real-world problems. In multiple cases, the techniques of GrC allow for an increase in efficiency and calculating speed, better data legibility and improvements in the performance of classifier algorithms the granulated data is supplied to. The examined approaches are then taxonomised with regard to the purpose of granulation, and with regard to the utilized aspect of Granular Computing.},

abstract = {As result of the digitalization of the military operations, the need for capabilities able to facilitate the acquisition of cyber situation awareness are increasingly demanded. In this context, augmenting the conscious of the context and warfare environment, risks and impacts of cyber threats on kinetic actuations became a critical rule-changer that military decision-makers must consider. Among the challenges that developing these solutions addresses, it is worth to highlight the dynamically assessment of the impact of the ICT infrastructure that enables the modern military operations, regarding the mission expectations and goals. In this context, the identification of Key Cyber Terrains (KCT) becomes an essential task, which requires the analysis of cross-domain knowledge from the tactical environment combined by feeds from the cyberspace. Bearing this in mind, the aim of the research presented in this paper is to explore the existing gaps and challenges concerning the dynamic cyber asset valuation and based on that, design a supporting system able to automatically identify KCT on military missions that rely on the cyberspace. Accordingly, the proposed KCT identification solution was not only a cyber risk management analysis tool for dual-use cyber assets, but a full procedure for their mission-centric identification. The approach explored the dependency degrees among tasks and assets defined by commanders as part of the assessment criteria. They were correlated with the discoveries on the operational network and the asset vulnerabilities identified thorough the supported mission development. In order to facilitate the understanding of the introduced method, an illustrative use case that combined a hypothetical mission scenario with real network traffic has been defined and discussed.},

abstract = {SQL Injection attacks are the costly and critical attacks on web applications: it is a code injection technique that allows attackers to obtain unrestricted access to the databases and potentially sensitive information like usernames, passwords, email ids, credit card details present in them. Various techniques have been proposed to address the problem of SQL Injection attack such as defense coding practices, detection and prevention techniques, and intrusion detection systems. However most of these techniques have one or more disadvantages such as requirement for code modification, applicable to limited type of attacks and web applications. In this paper, we discuss a secure mechanism for protecting web applications from SQL Injection attacks by using framework and database firewall. This mechanism uses combined static and dynamic analysis technique. In static analysis, we list URLs, forms, injection points, and vulnerable parameters of web application. Thus, we identify valid queries that could be generated by the application. In dynamic analysis, we use database firewall to monitor runtime generated queries and check them against the whitelist of queries. The experimental setup makes use of real web applications and two open source tools namely Web Application Attack and Audit Framework (w3af) and GreenSQL. We used w3af for listing all the valid queries and GreenSQL as database firewall. The results show that implemented mechanism is capable of detecting all types of SQL Injection attacks without requiring any code modification to the existing web application but with an additional element of deploying a proxy.},

abstract = {Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are a new breed of internet based smart threats, which can go undetected with the existing state of-the-art internet traffic monitoring and protection systems. With the evolution of internet and cloud computing, a new generation of smart APT attacks has also evolved and signature based threat detection systems are proving to be futile and insufficient. One of the essential strategies in detecting APTs is to continuously monitor and analyze various features of a TCP/IP connection, such as the number of transferred packets, the total count of the bytes exchanged, the duration of the TCP/IP connections, and details of the number of packet flows. The current threat detection approaches make extensive use of machine learning algorithms that utilize statistical and behavioral knowledge of the traffic. However, the performance of these algorithms is far from satisfactory in terms of reducing false negatives and false positives simultaneously. Mostly, current algorithms focus on reducing false positives, only. This paper presents a fractal based anomaly classification mechanism, with the goal of reducing both false positives and false negatives, simultaneously. A comparison of the proposed fractal based method with a traditional Euclidean based machine learning algorithm (k-NN) shows that the proposed method significantly outperforms the traditional approach by reducing false positive and false negative rates, simultaneously, while improving the overall classification rates.},

abstract = {Because of the complexity of network traffic, there are various significant challenges in the network anomaly detection fields. One of the major challenges is the lack of labeled training data. In this paper, we use federated learning to tackle data scarcity problem and to preserve data privacy, where multiple participants collaboratively train a global model. Unlike the centralized training architecture, participants do not need to share their training to the server in federated learning, which can prevent the training data from being exploited by attackers. Moreover, most of the previous works focus on one specific task of anomaly detection, which restricts the application areas and can not provide more valuable information to network administrators. Therefore, we propose a multi-task deep neural network in federated learning (MT-DNN-FL) to perform network anomaly detection task, VPN (Tor) traffic recognition task, and traffic classification task, simultaneously. Compared with multiple single-task models, the multi-task method can reduce training time overhead. Experiments conducted on well-known CICIDS2017, ISCXVPN2016, and ISCXTor2016 datasets, show that the detection and classification performance achieved by the proposed method is better than the baseline methods in centralized training architecture.},

abstract = {Auditing is an increasingly essential tool for the defense of computing systems, but the unwieldy nature of log data imposes significant burdens on administrators and analysts. To address this issue, a variety of techniques have been proposed for approximating the contents of raw audit logs, facilitating efficient storage and analysis. However, the security value of these approximated logs is difficult to measure—relative to the original log, it is unclear if these techniques retain the forensic evidence needed to effectively investigate threats. Unfortunately, prior work has only investigated this issue anecdotally, demonstrating sufficient evidence is retained for specific attack scenarios. In this work, we address this gap in the literature through formalizing metrics for quantifying the forensic validity of an approximated audit log under differing threat models. In addition to providing quantifiable security arguments for prior work, we also identify a novel point in the approximation design space—that log events describing typical (benign) system activity can be aggressively approximated, while events that encode anomalous behavior should be preserved with lossless fidelity. We instantiate this notion of Attack-Preserving forensic validity in LogApprox, a new approximation technique that eliminates the redundancy of voluminous file I/O associated with benign process activities. We evaluate LogApprox alongside a corpus of exemplar approximation techniques from prior work and demonstrate that LogApprox achieves comparable log reduction rates while retaining 100% of attack-identifying log events. Additionally, we utilize this evaluation to illuminate the inherent trade-off between performance and utility within existing approximation techniques. This work thus establishes trustworthy foundations for the design of the next generation of efficient auditing frameworks. },

The results indicate both strengths and gaps. A strength is available advice on how to accomplish many specific tasks. However, there is little guidance on how to prioritize tasks in limited time or how to interpret, generalize, and convincingly report results. Future work should focus on these gaps in explication and specification of decision-making during incident analysis.},

abstract = {Threat actors can be persistent, motivated and agile, and they leverage a diversified and extensive set of tactics, techniques, and procedures to attain their goals. In response to that, organizations establish threat intelligence programs to improve their defense capabilities and mitigate risk. Actionable threat intelligence is integrated into security information and event management systems (SIEM) forming a threat intelligence platform. A threat intelligence platform aggregates log data from multiple disparate sources by deploying numerous collection agents and provides centralized analysis and reporting of an organization's security events for identifying malicious activity. Sysmon logs is a data source that has received considerable attention for endpoint visibility. Approaches for threat detection using Sysmon have been proposed mainly focusing on search engines (NoSQL database systems). This paper presents a new automated threat assessment system that relies on the analysis of continuous incoming feeds of Sysmon logs. The system is based on a cyber threat intelligence ontology and analyses Sysmon logs to classify software in different threat levels and augment cyber defensive capabilities through situational awareness, prediction, and automated courses of action.},

In order to protect users from this treats many companies have been developing new algorithms and products. However, malware types have been increasing dramatically. Anti-malware producers have been detecting with millions of new malware types each year. So in order to stop that increase, there is an urgent need to develop new intelligent methods on malware detection. In this work, we have overviewed current intelligent machine learning and deep learning methods to solve malware detection. In this sense, we will present malware feature extraction and classification methods. Also, we will discuss more issues and challenges on that problem.

abstract = {Unsupervised Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been widely used in various security-related anomaly detection applications, owing to the great promise of being able to detect unforeseen threats and superior performance provided by Deep Neural Networks (DNN). However, the lack of interpretability creates key barriers to the adoption of DL models in practice. Unfortunately, existing interpretation approaches are proposed for supervised learning models and/or non-security domains, which are unadaptable for unsupervised DL models and fail to satisfy special requirements in security domains.In this paper, we propose DeepAID, a general framework aiming to (1) interpret DL-based anomaly detection systems in security domains, and (2) improve the practicality of these systems based on the interpretations. We first propose a novel interpretation method for unsupervised DNNs by formulating and solving well-designed optimization problems with special constraints for security domains. Then, we provide several applications based on our Interpreter as well as a model-based extension Distiller to improve security systems by solving domain-specific problems. We apply DeepAID over three types of security-related anomaly detection systems and extensively evaluate our Interpreter with representative prior works. Experimental results show that DeepAID can provide high-quality interpretations for unsupervised DL models while meeting the special requirements of security domains. We also provide several use cases to show that DeepAID can help security operators to understand model decisions, diagnose system mistakes, give feedback to models, and reduce false positives.},

abstract = {Recently, Content Delivery Networks (CDN) have become more and more popular. The technology itself is ahead of academic research in this area. Several dimensions of the technology have not been adequately investigated by academia. These dimensions include outline management, security, and standardization. Discovering and highlighting aspects of this technology that may have or have not been covered by academic research is the first step toward helping academia bridge the gap with industry or even go one step further to lead industry in the right direction. This suggests a comprehensive survey on research works in this regard. The literature in this area has already come up with some surveys and taxonomies, but some of them are outdated or do not cover every aspect of CDN while others fail to detect existing trends or to develop a holistic roadmap for research on the technology. Furthermore, none of the existing surveys aim at enlightening the dark aspects of the technology that have not been subject to academic research. In this survey, we first extract the lifecycle of a CDN as suggested by the existing research. Then, we investigate previous relevant works on each phase of the lifecycle to clarify where the research is currently located and headed. We show how CDN technology tends to converge with emerging paradigms such as cloud computing, edge computing, and machine learning, which are more mature in terms of academic research. This helps us determine the right direction for further research by revealing the deficiencies in existing works.},

The volume of data obfuscating such scans can be overwhelming and makes computation challenging. Such scans pose network security risks since identifying running services, the goal of executing such scans, is the first step in launching an attack on the scanned host. To detect sophisticated scans we propose the integration of graph feature extraction techniques with visualization to simultaneously optimize computational complexity and human analyst time. The integrated approach uses graph modeling and preprocessing to make visual displays easy to comprehend, and uses human intervention to avoid solving NP-hard computational problems while still providing real-time visualization.},

Despite the progress made in the area of botnet prevention, detection, and mitigation, stealthy botnets continue to pose a significant risk to enterprises. Furthermore, existing enterprise-scale solutions require significant resources to operate effectively, thus they are not practical. In order to address this important problem in a resource-constrained environment, we propose a reinforcement learning based approach to optimally and dynamically deploy a limited number of defensive mechanisms, namely honeypots and network-based detectors, within the target network. The ultimate goal of the proposed approach is to reduce the lifetime of stealthy botnets by maximizing the number of bots identified and taken down through a sequential decision-making process. We provide a proof-of-concept of the proposed approach, and study its performance in a simulated environment. The results show that the proposed approach is promising in protecting against stealthy botnets.},

abstract = {The emerging need for cyber defence capabilities able to bring closer cyberspace supremacy in joint military operations has led defence practitioners to begin a cyber race where academy, researchers, industry and military organizations work together. Because of the higher maturity of civilian technologies for cybersecurity, this often involves adapting capabilities not initially intended for military use to new dual-use requirements, where concepts like operations, missions or Courses of Action (CoAs) shall be presented and aligned with the military doctrine. One of the main 'battle horses' in this transformation is to develop supporting systems able to facilitate the mission-centric acquisition of Cyber Situational Awareness (CSA), where the observations in the cyberspace shall be properly correlated, propagated and understood in the scope of planned/ongoing mission. But despite these CSA needs, there is a wide methodological gap in the lack of suitable validation and verification frameworks, which not only relies on the raising need for capabilities able to verify if the existing solutions meet the requirements to operate on military actions, but also to support the thorough development life-cycle of brand new cyber defence technologies. In these grounds, this research introduces a novel evaluation framework able to guide the evaluation of CSA related tools, for which three core validation concepts are discussed: software, operational and application tests. They cover from the day-to-day implementation of the new capabilities, to their ability of facilitating that human decision-makers acquire a joint operational picture.},

Current research mainly focuses on the development of security and privacy methods. However, ML practitioners, as the individuals in charge of translating the theory into practical applications, have not yet received much attention. In this paper, the security and privacy awareness and practices of ML practitioners are studied through an online survey with the aim of (1) gaining insight into the current state of awareness, (2) identifying influencing factors, and (3) exploring the actual use of existing methods and tools. The results indicate a relatively low general privacy and security awareness among the ML practitioners surveyed. In addition, they are less familiar with ML privacy protection methods than with general security methods or ML-related ones. Moreover, awareness correlates with the years of working with ML but not with the level of academic education or the field of occupation. Finally, the practitioners in this study seem to experience uncertainties in implementing legal frameworks, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation, into their ML workflows.},

Unfortunately, the research community has not given to this problem the attention it deserves, and, as a consequence, the state-of-the-art approaches to the detection of malicious Java applets are based either on simple signatures or on the use of honey-clients, which are both easily evaded. Therefore, we propose a novel approach to the detection of malicious Java applets based on static code analysis. Our approach extracts a number of features from Java applets, and then uses supervised machine learning to produce a classifier. We implemented our approach in a tool, called Jarhead, and we tested its effectiveness on a large, real-world dataset. The results of the evaluation show that, given a sufficiently large training dataset, this approach is able to reliably detect both known and previously-unseen real-world malicious applets.},

In this paper, to further push forward this direction with a comprehensive study in both algorithm and system design, we build FedIoT platform that contains FedDetect algorithm for on-device anomaly data detection and a system design for realistic evaluation of federated learning on IoT devices. Furthermore, the proposed FedDetect learning framework improves the performance by utilizing a local adaptive optimizer (e.g., Adam) and a cross-round learning rate scheduler. In a network of realistic IoT devices (Raspberry PI), we evaluate FedIoT platform and FedDetect algorithm in both model and system performance. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of federated learning in detecting a wider range of attack types occurred at multiple devices. The system efficiency analysis indicates that both end-to-end training time and memory cost are affordable and promising for resource-constrained IoT devices.

abstract = {Performing anomaly detection on attributed networks concerns with finding nodes whose patterns or behaviors deviate significantly from the majority of reference nodes. Its success can be easily found in many real-world applications such as network intrusion detection, opinion spam detection and system fault diagnosis, to name a few. Despite their empirical success, a vast majority of existing efforts are overwhelmingly performed in an unsupervised scenario due to the expensive labeling costs of ground truth anomalies. In fact, in many scenarios, a small amount of prior human knowledge of the data is often effortless to obtain, and getting it involved in the learning process has shown to be effective in advancing many important learning tasks. Additionally, since new types of anomalies may constantly arise over time especially in an adversarial environment, the interests of human expert could also change accordingly regarding to the detected anomaly types. It brings further challenges to conventional anomaly detection algorithms as they are often applied in a batch setting and are incapable to interact with the environment. To tackle the above issues, in this paper, we investigate the problem of anomaly detection on attributed networks in an interactive setting by allowing the system to proactively communicate with the human expert in making a limited number of queries about ground truth anomalies. Our objective is to maximize the true anomalies presented to the human expert after a given budget is used up. Along with this line, we formulate the problem through the principled multi-armed bandit framework and develop a novel collaborative contextual bandit algorithm, named GraphUCB. In particular, our developed algorithm: (1) explicitly models the nodal attributes and node dependencies seamlessly in a joint framework; and (2) handles the exploration-exploitation dilemma when querying anomalies of different types. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show the improvement of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {Data sketches are approximate succinct summaries of long data streams. They are widely used for processing massive amounts of data and answering statistical queries about it. Existing libraries producing sketches are very fast, but do not allow parallelism for creating sketches using multiple threads or querying them while they are being built. We present a generic approach to parallelising data sketches efficiently and allowing them to be queried in real time, while bounding the error that such parallelism introduces. Utilising relaxed semantics and the notion of strong linearisability we prove our algorithm's correctness and analyse the error it induces in two specific sketches. Our implementation achieves high scalability while keeping the error small. We have contributed one of our concurrent sketches to the open-source data sketches library.},

abstract = {Online retail, eCommerce, frequently falls victim to fraud conducted by malicious customers (fraudsters) who obtain goods or services through deception. Fraud coordinated by groups of professional fraudsters that place several fraudulent orders to maximize their gain is referred to as organized fraud. Existing approaches to fraud detection typically analyze orders in isolation and they are not effective at identifying groups of fraudulent orders linked to organized fraud. These also wrongly identify many legitimate orders as fraud, which hinders their usage for automated fraud cancellation. We introduce a novel solution to detect organized fraud by analyzing orders in bulk. Our approach is based on clustering and aims to group together fraudulent orders placed by the same group of fraudsters. It selectively uses two existing techniques, agglomerative clustering and sampling to recursively group orders into small clusters in a reasonable amount of time. We assess our clustering technique on real-world orders placed on the Zalando website, the largest online apparel retailer in Europe1. Our clustering processes 100,000s of orders in a few hours and groups 35-45% of fraudulent orders together. We propose a simple technique built on top of our clustering that detects 26.2% of fraud while raising false alarms for only 0.1% of legitimate orders.},

abstract = {In this talk, we highlight two topics on security from our lab. First, we address the problem of Internet traffic classification (e.g. web, filesharing, or botnet?). We present a fundamentally different approach to classifying traffic that studies the network wide behavior by modeling the interactions of users as a graph. By contrast, most previous approaches use statistics such as packet sizes and inter-packet delays. We show how our approach gives rise to novel and powerful ways to: (a) visualize the traffic, (b) model the behavior of applications, and (c) detect abnormalities and attacks. Extending this approach, we develop ENTELECHEIA, a botnet-detection method. Tests with real data suggests that our graph-based approach is very promising.Second, we present, MyPageKeeper, a security Facebook app, with 13K downloads, which we deployed to: (a) quantify the presence of malware on Facebook, and (b) protect end-users. We designed MyPageKeeper in a way that strikes the balance between accuracy and scalability. Our initial results are scary and interesting: (a) malware is widespread, with 49% of our users are exposed to at least one malicious post from a friend, and (b) roughly 74% of all malicious posts contain links that point back to Facebook, and thus would evade any of the current web-based filtering approaches.},

abstract = {Ransomware is a class of malware that gains unauthorized admittance to organizational and personal assets and blocks their access to legitimate users and staff. It accomplishes this by encrypting the algorithms with a strong encryption technique. The Hacker demands a ransom to allow access to the asset and revert the control to the authorized organizations. Many individuals and Organizations have been victim to such Ransomware Attacks. With the mounting growth of technology, such attacks have increased exponentially and the need for adequate preventive techniques are also increasing. This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art Ransomware detection techniques implemented to resist such attacks. While most surveys focus on ransomware detection using Machine learning techniques, this survey concentrates on Ransomware techniques that apply the sub-domains of Artificial Intelligence. This paper reviews detection techniques that employ Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques, which are sub-fields of AI for ransomware detection. Though the reviewed works have good detection rates, a few open concerns are identified and discussed. The primary objective of the review is to highlight concerns of the proposed system that prevent it from becoming effective in real-time systems.},

Existing program anomaly detection systems focusing on legal control flow attestation and short call sequence verification are inadequate to detect such stealthy attacks. In this paper, we point out the need to analyze program execution paths and discover event correlations in large-scale execution windows among millions of instructions. We propose an anomaly detection approach with two-stage machine learning algorithms to recognize diverse normal call-correlation patterns and detect program attacks at both inter- and intra-cluster levels. We implement a prototype of our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness against three real-world attacks and four synthetic anomalies with less than 0.01% false positive rates and 0.1~1.3 ms analysis overhead per behavior instance (1k to 50k function or system calls).},

The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of scientific works in the field of cybersecurity of machine learning and to present an original taxonomy of adversarial attacks against machine learning systems in this context.

abstract = {Advanced cyber attacks consist of multiple stages aimed at being stealthy and elusive. Such attack patterns leave their footprints spatio-temporally dispersed across many different logs in victim machines. However, existing log-mining intrusion analysis systems typically target only a single type of log to discover evidence of an attack and therefore fail to exploit fundamental inter-log connections. The output of such single-log analysis can hardly reveal the complete attack story for complex, multi-stage attacks. Additionally, some existing approaches require heavyweight system instrumentation, which makes them impractical to deploy in real production environments. To address these problems, we present HERCULE, an automated multi-stage log-based intrusion analysis system. Inspired by graph analytics research in social network analysis, we model multi-stage intrusion analysis as a community discovery problem. HERCULE builds multi-dimensional weighted graphs by correlating log entries across multiple lightweight logs that are readily available on commodity systems. From these, HERCULE discovers any "attack communities" embedded within the graphs. Our evaluation with 15 well known APT attack families demonstrates that HERCULE can reconstruct attack behaviors from a spectrum of cyber attacks that involve multiple stages with high accuracy and low false positive rates.},

In this work, applications of genetic programming (GP) and stream active learning are evaluated for insider threat detection. Linear GP with lexicase/multi-objective selection is employed to address the problem under a stationary data assumption. Moreover, streaming GP is employed to address the problem under a non-stationary data assumption. Experiments conducted on a publicly available corporate data set show the capability of the approaches in dealing with extreme class imbalance, stream learning and adaptation to the real world context.},

APT can remain undetected for a long time span and lead to undesirable consequences such as stealing of sensitive data, broken workflow, and so on. To achieve the attack goal, attackers usually leverage specific tactics that utilize a variety of techniques. This paper explores the recognition of APT tactics through synthesized analysis and correlation of data from various sources. We propose a framework for detecting the APT tactics and discuss the application of different APT technique identification methods. Our framework can be used by the security analysts for effective detection of APT attacks. The evaluation of our approach shows that it can detect APT tactics with high accuracy and low false positive rate. Therefore, it can be used for tactic-centric APT detection and effective implementation of cyber security response operations.},

abstract = {Unfortunately, the computers we use for everyday activities can be infiltrated while simply browsing innocuous sites that, unbeknownst to the website owner, may be laden with malicious advertisements. So-called malvertising, redirects browsers to web-based exploit kits that are designed to find vulnerabilities in the browser and subsequently download malicious payloads. We propose a new approach for detecting such malfeasance by leveraging the inherent structural patterns in HTTP traffic to classify exploit kit instances. Our key insight is that an exploit kit leads the browser to download payloads using multiple requests from malicious servers. We capture these interactions in a "tree-like" form, and using a scalable index of malware samples, model the detection process as a subtree similarity search problem. The approach is evaluated on 3800 hours of real-world traffic including over 4 billion flows and reduces false positive rates by four orders of magnitude over current state-of-the-art techniques with comparable true positive rates. We show that our approach can operate in near real-time, and is able to handle peak traffic levels on a large enterprise network --- identifying 28 new exploit kit instances during our analysis period.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection is a useful technique in many applications such as network security and fraud detection. Due to the insufficiency of anomaly samples as training data, it is usually formulated as an unsupervised model learning problem. In recent years there is a surge of adopting graph data structure in numerous applications. Detecting anomaly in an attributed network is more challenging than the sample based task because of the sample information representations in the form of graph nodes and edges. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial attributed network (GAAN) anomaly detection framework. The fake graph nodes are generated by a generator module with Gaussian noise as input. An encoder module is employed to map both real and fake graph nodes into a latent space. To encode the graph structure information into the node latent representation, we compute the sample covariance matrix for real nodes and fake nodes respectively. A discriminator is trained to recognize whether two connected nodes are from the real or fake graph. With the learned encoder module output, an anomaly evaluation measurement considering the sample reconstruction error and real-sample identification confidence is employed to make prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and compare with state-of-the-art attributed graph anomaly detection methods. The superior AUC score demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The malicious software, or malware, that infect the systems are its basic units and they are responsible for its global behavior. Anti Virus software and Intrusion Detection Systems detect botnets by analyzing network and files, looking for signature and known behavioral patterns. Thus, the malware hiding capability is a crucial aspect. This paper describes a new obfuscation mechanism based on evolutionary algorithms: an evolutionary core is embedded in the malware to generate a different, optimized hiding strategy for every single infection. Such always-changing, hard-to-detect malware can be used by security industries to stress the analysis methodologies and to test the ability to react to malware mutations. This research is the first step in a more ambitious research project, where a whole botnet, composed of different malware and Anti Virus software, is analyzed as a prey-predator ecosystem.},

abstract = {With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), embedded devices have been gaining importance in our daily lives, as well as industrial processes. Independent of their usage, be it within an IoT system or a CPS, embedded devices are always an attractive target for security attacks, mainly due to their continuous network availability and the importance of the data they handle. Thus, the design of such systems requires a thorough consideration of the various security constraints they are liable to. Introducing these security constraints, next to other requirements, such as power consumption, and performance increases the number of design choices a system designer must consider. As the various constraints are often conflicting with each other, designers face the complex task of balancing them. System designers facilitate Design Space Exploration (DSE) tools to support a system designer in this job. However, available DSE tools only offer a limited way of considering security constraints during the design process. In this article, we introduce a novel DSE framework, which allows the consideration of security constraints, in the form of attack scenarios, and attack mitigations in the form of security tasks. Based on the descriptions of the system’s functionality and architecture, possible attacks, and known mitigation techniques, the framework finds the optimal design for a secure IoT device or CPS. Our framework’s functionality and its benefits are shown based on the design of a secure sensor system.},

abstract = {Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) facilitate communication between brains and computers. As these devices become increasingly popular outside of the medical context, research interest in brain privacy risks and countermeasures has bloomed. Several neuroprivacy threats have been identified in the literature, including brain malware, personal data being contained in collected brainwaves and the inadequacy of legal regimes with regards to neural data protection. Dozens of controls have been proposed or implemented for protecting neuroprivacy, although it has not been immediately apparent what the landscape of neuroprivacy controls consists of. This paper inventories the implemented and proposed neuroprivacy risk mitigation techniques from open source repositories, BCI providers and the academic literature. These controls are mapped to the Hoepman privacy strategies and their implementation status is described. Several research directions for ensuring the protection of neuroprivacy are identified.},

abstract = {Modern malware is complex, stealthy, and employ anti-forensics techniques to evade detection. In order to detect malware, data must be collected, such, allows further analyses of the malware's behaviour. However, when both the malware and the detecting system run on the same domain (the CPU) it's questionable whether the data acquired by the acquisition method is not tampered with. Hardware based techniques, such as acquiring data out-of-band using a PCIe device allow for data acquisition that is deemed trusted when the acquisition method does not rely on any data present on the host memory. Unfortunately, in Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) based systems, peripheral devices access to host memory go through a stage of translation by the IOMMU. The translation tables which reside in the host's memory are subject to malware control, hence are not trustworthy. In this paper we present a method that allows acquiring the data reliably without dependant on data residing in host memory, even when IOMMU is being used to restrict devices. We show how accessing host physical memory is achieved and discuss why this is not a vulnerability in some platforms, but rather a powerful tool for securing data acquisition when the host is not trusted to perform the acquisition.},

abstract = {A hardware Trojan is a malicious circuit inserted into a device by a malicious designer or manufacturer in the circuit design or fabrication phase. With the globalization of semiconductor industry, more and more chips and devices are designed, integrated and fabricated by untrusted manufacturers, who can potentially insert hardware Trojans for launching attacks after the devices are deployed. Moreover, the most damaging attack in a smart grid is a large scale electricity failure, which can cause very serious consequences that are worse than any disaster. Unfortunately, this attack can be implemented very easily by synchronized hardware Trojans acting as a collective offline time bomb; the Trojans do not need to interact with one another and can affect a large fraction of nodes in a power grid. More sophisticatedly, this attack can also be realized by online hardware Trojans which keep listening to the communication channel and wait for a trigger event to trigger their malicious payloads; here, a broadcast message triggers all the Trojans at the same time.In this paper, we address the offline synchronized hardware Trojan attack, as it does not require the adversary to penetrate the power grid network for sending triggers. We classify two types of offline synchronized hardware Trojan attacks as type A and B: type B requires communication between different nodes, and type A does not. The hardware Trojans needed for type B turn out to be much more complex (and therefore larger in area size) than those for type A. In order to prevent type A attacks we suggest to enforce each power grid node to work in an unique time domain which has a random time offset to Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). This isolation principle can mitigate type A offline synchronized hardware Trojan attacks in a smart grid, such that even if hardware Trojans are implanted in functional units, e.g. Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), they can only cause a minimal damage, i.e. sporadic single node failures. The proposed solution only needs a trusted Global Positioning System (GPS) module which provides the correct UTC together with small additional interface circuitry. This means that our solution can be used to protect the current power grid infrastructure against type A offline attacks without replacing any untrusted functional unit, which may already have embedded hardware Trojans.},

abstract = {Although malicious software (malware) has been around since the early days of computers, the sophistication and innovation of malware has increased over the years. In particular, the latest crop of ransomware has drawn attention to the dangers of malicious software, which can cause harm to private users as well as corporations, public services (hospitals and transportation systems), governments, and security institutions. To protect these institutions and the public from malware attacks, malicious activity must be detected as early as possible, preferably before it conducts its harmful acts. However, it is not always easy to know what to look for—especially when dealing with new and unknown malware that has never been seen. Analyzing a suspicious file by static or dynamic analysis methods can provide relevant and valuable information regarding a file's impact on the hosting system and help determine whether the file is malicious or not, based on the method's predefined rules. While various techniques (e.g., code obfuscation, dynamic code loading, encryption, and packing) can be used by malware writers to evade static analysis (including signature-based anti-virus tools), dynamic analysis is robust to these techniques and can provide greater understanding regarding the analyzed file and consequently can lead to better detection capabilities. Although dynamic analysis is more robust than static analysis, existing dynamic analysis tools and techniques are imperfect, and there is no single tool that can cover all aspects of malware behavior. The most recent comprehensive survey performed in this area was published in 2012. Since that time, the computing environment has changed dramatically with new types of malware (ransomware, cryptominers), new analysis methods (volatile memory forensics, side-channel analysis), new computing environments (cloud computing, IoT devices), new machine-learning algorithms, and more. The goal of this survey is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of existing methods used to dynamically analyze malware, which includes a description of each method, its strengths and weaknesses, and its resilience against malware evasion techniques. In addition, we include an overview of prominent studies presenting the usage of machine-learning methods to enhance dynamic malware analysis capabilities aimed at detection, classification, and categorization.},

Despite this, we find that today's middlebox infrastructure is expensive, complex to manage, and creates new failure modes for the networks that use them. Given the promise of cloud computing to decrease costs, ease management, and provide elasticity and fault-tolerance, we argue that middlebox processing can benefit from outsourcing the cloud.

We show that APLOMB solves real problems faced by network administrators, can outsource over 90% of middlebox hardware in a typical large enterprise network, and, in a case study of a real enterprise, imposes an average latency penalty of 1.1ms and median bandwidth inflation of 3.8%.},

abstract = {People own and carry an increasing number of ubiquitous mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and notebooks. Being small and mobile, those devices have a high propensity to become lost or stolen. Since mobile devices provide access to their owners' digital lives, strong authentication is vital to protect sensitive information and services against unauthorized access. However, at least one in three devices is unprotected, with inconvenience of traditional authentication being the paramount reason. We present the concept of CORMORANT, an approach to significantly reduce the manual burden of mobile user verification through risk-aware, multi-modal biometric, cross-device authentication. Transparent behavioral and physiological biometrics like gait, voice, face, and keystroke dynamics are used to continuously evaluate the user's identity without explicit interaction. The required level of confidence in the user's identity is dynamically adjusted based on the risk of unauthorized access derived from signals like location, time of day and nearby devices. Authentication results are shared securely with trusted devices to facilitate cross-device authentication for co-located devices. Conducting a large-scale agent-based simulation of 4 000 users based on more than 720 000 days of real-world device usage traces and 6.7 million simulated robberies and thefts sourced from police reports, we found the proposed approach is able to reduce the frequency of password entries required on smartphones by 97.82% whilst simultaneously reducing the risk of unauthorized access in the event of a crime by 97.72%, compared to conventional knowledge-based authentication.},

Existing techniques for AG generation rely heavily on expert input regarding vulnerabilities and network topology. In this work, we advocate the use of AGs that are built directly using the actions observed through intrusion alerts, without prior expert input. We have developed an unsupervised visual analytics system, called SAGE, to learn alert-driven attack graphs. We show how these AGs (i) enable forensic analysis of prior attacks, and (ii) enable proactive defense by providing relevant threat intelligence regarding attacker strategies. We believe that alert-driven AGs can play a key role in AI-enabled cyber threat intelligence as they open up new avenues for attacker strategy analysis whilst reducing analyst workload.},

abstract = {In many multiagent domains, no single observation event is sufficient to determine that the behavior of individuals is suspicious. Instead, suspiciousness must be inferred from a combination of multiple events, where events refer to the individual's interactions with other individuals. Hence, a detection system must employ a detector that combines evidence from multiple events, in contrast to most previous work, which focuses on the detection of a single, clearly suspicious event. This paper proposes a two-step detection system, where it first detects trigger events from multiagent interactions, and then combines the evidence to provide a degree of suspicion. The paper provides three key contributions: (i) proposes a novel detector that generalizes a utility-based plan recognition with arbitrary utility functions, (ii) specifies conditions that any reasonable detector should satisfy, and (iii) analyzes three detectors and compares them with the proposed approach. The results on a simulated airport domain and a dangerous-driver domain show that our new algorithm outperforms other approaches in several settings.},

abstract = {Malware analysis relies on monitoring the behavior of a suspected application within a confined, controlled and secure environment. These environments are commonly referred to as "Sandboxes'' and are often virtualized replicas of a regular system. Hypervisor-based sandboxes were among the most commonly used techniques for malware analysis during the last decade; however, these sandboxes do not often provide the required stealth and transparency to deceive the malware in believing that it is being run in a target machine. This is due to the difference between virtualized systems and bare metal ones; differences which are exploited by the malware as detection artifacts. In this paper, we address the aforementioned problem by exploring the use of container-based environments as an alternative to hypervisor-based sandboxes for malware analysis. More precisely, we explore different ways to monitor containerized applications and make these containers act and look as close to real systems as possible. Our experimental results revealed that Docker containers are a promising option for a sandbox. However, this option comes at the cost of new detection artifacts which make containers subject to fingerprinting through different sources that malware can easily find. We explore these sources and try to address them by various means including system-call introspection. Finally, based on our discoveries, we introduce a container detection tool that will give the research community an opportunity to investigate malware analysis through containers in more details.},

abstract = {Honeypots have been widely employed to track attackers' activities and divert potential threats against real assets. A critical challenge of honeypot research is how to better integrate deceptive honeypots as part of an overall production network. Conventional honeypots are typically deployed as separate assets near those they are protecting---they are not in the direct line of fire. Such a setup does not effectively protect real assets since attackers do not require a full network scan to identify certain production hosts.In this paper, we present a novel framework to transparently project vulnerable honey services atop real production systems without interfering the production system. The key idea is to use SDN technology to divide a production network into segments of production and decoy servers. Traffic intended for production workloads is redirected to decoys based on port or service information. The decoy servers run "vulnerable" services that are heavily monitored. From the attackers' perspective, these vulnerable services run on production systems, but traffic is instead relayed to a honeypot with the same configuration (e.g., IP address, MAC address, running services) of the protected production system. In this way, our approach capitalizes on capturing attacks before they reach protected assets. We demonstrate its feasibility with a prototype implementation and practical deployment model. Evaluation shows that our approach incurs negligible overhead and resists potential side channel fingerprinting attacks.},

abstract = {Research has proved that supposedly secure encrypted network traffic is actually threatened by privacy and security violations from many aspects. This is mainly due to flow features leaking evidence about user activity and data content. Currently, adversaries can use statistical traffic analysis to create classifiers for network applications and infer users’ sensitive data. In this article, we propose a system that optimally prevents traffic feature leaks. In our first algorithm, we model the packet length probability distribution of the source app to be protected and that of the target app that the source app will resemble. We define a model that mutates the packet lengths of a source app to those lengths from the target app having similar bin probability. This would confuse a classifier by identifying a mutated source app as the target app. In our second obfuscation algorithm, we present an optimized scheme resulting in a trade-off between privacy and complexity overhead. For this reason, we propose a mathematical model for network obfuscation. We formulate analytically the problem of selecting the target app and the length from the target app to mutate to. Then, we propose an algorithm to solve it dynamically. Extensive evaluation of the proposed models, on real app traffic traces, shows significant obfuscation efficiency with relatively acceptable overhead. We were able to reduce a classification accuracy from 91.1% to 0.22% using the first algorithm, with 11.86% padding overhead. The same classification accuracy was reduced to 1.76% with only 0.73% overhead using the second algorithm.},

abstract = {A distributed detection method is proposed to detect single stage multi-point (SSMP) attacks on a Cyber Physical System (CPS). Such attacks aim at compromising two or more sensors or actuators at any one stage of a CPS and could totally compromise a controller and prevent it from detecting the attack. However, as demonstrated in this work, using the flow properties of water from one stage to the other, a neighboring controller was found effective in detecting such attacks. The method is based on physical invariants derived for each stage of the CPS from its design. The attack detection effectiveness of the method was evaluated experimentally against an operational water treatment testbed containing 42 sensors and actuators. Results from the experiments point to high effectiveness of the method in detecting a variety of SSMP attacks but also point to its limitations. Distributing the attack detection code among various controllers adds to the scalability of the proposed method.},

abstract = {As connectivity between and within vehicles increases, so does concern about safety and security. Various automotive serial protocols are used inside vehicles such as Controller Area Network (CAN), Local Interconnect Network (LIN), and FlexRay. CAN Bus is the most used in-vehicle network protocol to support exchange of vehicle parameters between Electronic Control Units (ECUs). This protocol lacks security mechanisms by design and is therefore vulnerable to various attacks. Furthermore, connectivity of vehicles has made the CAN Bus vulnerable not only from within the vehicle but also from outside. With the rise of connected cars, more entry points and interfaces have been introduced on board vehicles, thereby also leading to a wider potential attack surface. Existing security mechanisms focus on the use of encryption, authentication, and vehicle Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), which operate under various constraints such as low bandwidth, small frame size (e.g., in the CAN protocol), limited availability of computational resources, and real-time sensitivity. We survey and classify current cryptographic and IDS approaches and compare these approaches based on criteria such as real-time constraints, types of hardware used, changes in CAN Bus behaviour, types of attack mitigation, and software/ hardware used to validate these approaches. We conclude with mitigation strategies limitations and research challenges for the future.},

Attack graphs are a common formal model used to represent possible attacks. However, most existing works on attack graphs do not consider the reactions of attackers to different defender strategies. We introduce a game-theoretic model of the joint problem where attacker's strategies are represented using attack graphs, and defender's strategies are represented as modifications of the attack graph. The attack graphs we use allow for sequential attack actions with associated costs and probabilities of success/failure. We present an algorithm for an computing attack policy that maximizes attacker's expected reward and empirical results demonstrating our methods on a case study network.},

year = {2015},
isbn = {9781467383202},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Runtime Verification (RV) has recently emerged as a complementary technology to extend coverage of conventional software verification methods. To address the substantial performance and power overhead of pure software RV frameworks, this paper introduces NUVA, which stands for nonuniform verification architecture, a distributed automata-based RV architecture for parametric specifications in the form of parameterized finite-state automata, with a case study over a cache-coherent nonuniform-memory-access (ccNUMA) multiprocessor. The core of NUVA is a coherent distributed automata transactional memory (ATM) that efficiently maintains states of a dynamic population of automata checkers organized into a rooted dynamic directed acyclic graph (DAG) concurrently shared among all processor nodes. A cycle-accurate model of a ccNUMA multiprocessor confirms that performance slowdown is 1~3% and NoC message traffic increases by 10~15% at parametric event density1 of 0.025 EPI for two compute-intensive scientific benchmarks having irregular concurrent data structures. The detailed architecture and implementation metrics in TSMC 40nm CMOS technology are presented. NUVA can be dimensioned to incur average total power overhead of less than 140mW and area overhead of 4mm2 for a quad-core multiprocessor chip, at operating frequency of 250MHz. It is also estimated to incur 1.9~2.6% area overhead and 0.5~1% power overhead when integrated with Intel's family of high-end desktop and mobile quad-core processors operating at 1.6~3.2GHz. Our silicon implementation achieves average performance2 of 1.5 MEPS/mW. For a processor core with 5 MIPS/mW, this corresponds to a 3.2% drop in energy efficiency at parametric event density of 0.01 EPI.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical systems&nbsp;(CPSs) in critical infrastructure face a pervasive threat from attackers, motivating research into a variety of countermeasures for securing them. Assessing the effectiveness of these countermeasures is challenging, however, as realistic benchmarks of attacks are difficult to manually construct, blindly testing is ineffective due to the enormous search spaces and resource requirements, and intelligent fuzzing approaches require impractical amounts of data and network access. In this work, we propose active fuzzing, an automatic approach for finding test suites of packet-level CPS network attacks, targeting scenarios in which attackers can observe sensors and manipulate packets, but have no existing knowledge about the payload encodings. Our approach learns regression models for predicting sensor values that will result from sampled network packets, and uses these predictions to guide a search for payload manipulations (i.e.&nbsp;bit flips) most likely to drive the CPS into an unsafe state. Key to our solution is the use of online active learning, which iteratively updates the models by sampling payloads that are estimated to maximally improve them. We evaluate the efficacy of active fuzzing by implementing it for a water purification plant testbed, finding it can automatically discover a test suite of flow, pressure, and over/underflow attacks, all with substantially less time, data, and network access than the most comparable approach. Finally, we demonstrate that our prediction models can also be utilised as countermeasures themselves, implementing them as anomaly detectors and early warning systems.},

abstract = {Machine-learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly utilized in privacy-sensitive applications such as predicting lifestyle choices, making medical diagnoses, and facial recognition. In a model inversion attack, recently introduced in a case study of linear classifiers in personalized medicine by Fredrikson et al., adversarial access to an ML model is abused to learn sensitive genomic information about individuals. Whether model inversion attacks apply to settings outside theirs, however, is unknown. We develop a new class of model inversion attack that exploits confidence values revealed along with predictions. Our new attacks are applicable in a variety of settings, and we explore two in depth: decision trees for lifestyle surveys as used on machine-learning-as-a-service systems and neural networks for facial recognition. In both cases confidence values are revealed to those with the ability to make prediction queries to models. We experimentally show attacks that are able to estimate whether a respondent in a lifestyle survey admitted to cheating on their significant other and, in the other context, show how to recover recognizable images of people's faces given only their name and access to the ML model. We also initiate experimental exploration of natural countermeasures, investigating a privacy-aware decision tree training algorithm that is a simple variant of CART learning, as well as revealing only rounded confidence values. The lesson that emerges is that one can avoid these kinds of MI attacks with negligible degradation to utility.},

abstract = {Researchers and censoring regimes have long engaged in a cat-and-mouse game, leading to increasingly sophisticated Internet-scale censorship techniques and methods to evade them. In this paper, we take a drastic departure from the previously manual evade-detect cycle by developing techniques to automate the discovery of censorship evasion strategies. We present Geneva, a novel genetic algorithm that evolves packet-manipulation-based censorship evasion strategies against nation-state level censors. Geneva composes, mutates, and evolves sophisticated strategies out of four basic packet manipulation primitives (drop, tamper headers, duplicate, and fragment). With experiments performed both in-lab and against several real censors (in China, India, and Kazakhstan), we demonstrate that Geneva is able to quickly and independently re-derive most strategies from prior work, and derive novel subspecies and altogether new species of packet manipulation strategies. Moreover, Geneva discovers successful strategies that prior work posited were not effective, and evolves extinct strategies into newly working variants. We analyze the novel strategies Geneva creates to infer previously unknown behavior in censors. Geneva is a first step towards automating censorship evasion; to this end, we have made our code and data publicly available.},

abstract = {Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) have created new security challenges for critical infrastructures due to their stealthy, dynamic, and adaptive natures. In this work, we aim to lay a game-theoretic foundation by establishing a multi-stage Bayesian game framework to capture incomplete information of deceptive APTs and their multistage multi-phase movement. The analysis of the perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium (PBNE) enables a prediction of attacker's behaviors and a design of defensive strategies that can deter the adversaries and mitigate the security risks. A conjugate-prior method allows online computation of the belief and reduces Bayesian update into an iterative parameter update. The forwardly updated parameters are assimilated into the backward dynamic programming computation to characterize a computationally tractable and timeconsistent equilibrium solution based on the expanded state space. The Tennessee Eastman (TE) process control problem is used as a case study to demonstrate the dynamic game under the information asymmetry and show that APTs tend to be stealthy and deceptive during their transitions in the cyber layer and behave aggressively when reaching the targeted physical plant. The online update of the belief allows the defender to learn the behavior of the attacker and choose strategic defensive actions that can thwart adversarial behaviors and mitigate APTs. Numerical results illustrate the defender's tradeoff between the immediate reward and the future expectation as well as the attacker's goal to reach an advantageous system state while making the defender form a positive belief.},

abstract = {Data breaches represent a significant threat to organizations. While the general problem of protecting data has received much attention, one large (and growing) class has not - data that must be kept due to mandatory retention laws. Such data is often of little use to an organization, is rarely accessed, and represents a significant potential liability, yet cannot be discarded. Protecting such data entails an unusual combination of practical constraints (such as providing verification to a party that may be unknown) and thus requires functionality that is not well addressed by traditional cryptographic primitives. We propose to mitigate the risk to such data through a new system called Dragchute, which creates a time window during which locked data cannot be accessed by anyone. Based on a verifiable non-interactive, non-parallelizable, time-delay key escrow mechanism, Dragchute is novel in that it requires that no cryptographic material capable of providing early access to the data be retained, yet provides verification for multiple properties. We define a base construction for Dragchute, show possible extensions that help meet additional verification requirements, and characterize its performance. Our results show that Dragchute systems offer verifiable, customizable, computational protection against data exposure for encryption costs similar to traditional methods (e.g., less than 6% overhead compared to AEAD). We thus show that Dragchute systems provide a critical new means for protecting data that must be retained long term due to mandatory retention laws.},

abstract = { End-to-end email encryption (E2EE) ensures that an email could only be decrypted and read by its intended recipients. E2EE’s strong security guarantee is particularly desirable for the enterprises in the event of breaches: even if attackers break into an email server, under E2EE no contents of emails are leaked. Meanwhile, E2EE brings significant challenges for an enterprise to detect and filter unwanted emails (spams and phishing emails). Most existing solutions rely heavily on email contents (i.e., email body and attachments), which would be difficult when email contents are encrypted. In this paper, we investigate how to detect unwanted emails in a content-agnostic manner, that is, without access to the contents of emails at all. Our key observation is that the communication patterns and relationships among internal users of an enterprise contain rich and reliable information about benign email communications. Combining such information with other metadata of emails (headers and subjects when available), unwanted emails can be accurately distinguished from legitimate ones without access to email contents. Specifically, we propose two types of novel enterprise features from enterprise email logs: sender profiling features, which capture the patterns of past emails from external senders to internal recipients; and enterprise graph features, which capture the co-recipient and the sender-recipient relationships between internal users. We design a classifier utilizing the above features along with existing meta-data features. We run extensive experiments over a real-world enterprise email dataset, and show that our approach, even without any content-based features, achieves high true positive rate of 95.2% and low false positive rate of 0.3% with such stringent constraints. },

abstract = {In recent years, organizations ranging from defense and other government institutions to commercial enterprises, research labs, etc., have witnessed an increasing amount of sophisticated insider attacks that manage to bypass existing security controls. Insider threats are staged by either disgruntled employees, or employees engaged in malicious activities such as industrial espionage. The objectives of such threats range from sabotage, e.g., in order to disrupt the completion of a project, to exfiltration of sensitive data such as trade secrets, patents, etc. Insiders are often skilled and motivated individuals with good knowledge of internal security measures in the organization. They devise effective and carefully planned attacks, prepared over long periods of time and customized to inflict maximum damage. Such attacks are difficult to detect and protect against, because insiders have the proper credentials to access services and systems within the organization, and possess knowledge that may allow them to deceive network defense controls. As a result, a large number of hosts may be taken over, allowing malicious insiders to maintain control over the network even after leaving the organization.The objective of this study is to identify a high-level architecture and mechanisms for early detection and protection against insider threats. One of the main aspects we focus on is preventing data exfiltration, which is known to cost billions of dollars in losses annually. The goal is to either (i) detect attacks as they occur and prevent insiders from gaining control over the network, or (ii) detect early hosts and services that are compromised such that malware is prevented from spreading/morphing, hence insiders are no longer able to control the network or to exfiltrate sensitive data. We envision a data-intensive approach that leverages large amounts of events collected from a diverse set of sources such as network sensors, intrusion detection systems, service logs, as well as known attack databases (e.g., virus signature collections, digital artifacts), security and service logs, etc. The proposed approach aims to study and understand the relationships and correlations between events, with the purpose of detecting anomalous and/or malicious behavior.},

abstract = {Spurious power consumption data reported from compromised meters controlled by organized adversaries in the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) may have drastic consequences on a smart grid’s operations. While existing research on data falsification in smart grids mostly defends against isolated electricity theft, we introduce a taxonomy of various data falsification attack types, when smart meters are compromised by organized or strategic rivals. To counter these attacks, we first propose a coarse-grained and a fine-grained anomaly-based security event detection technique that uses indicators such as deviation and directional change in the time series of the proposed anomaly detection metrics to indicate: (i) occurrence, (ii) type of attack, and (iii) attack strategy used, collectively known asattack context. Leveraging the attack context information, we propose three attack response metrics to the inferred attack context: (a) an unbiased mean indicating a robust location parameter; (b) a median absolute deviation indicating a robust scale parameter; and (c) an attack probability time ratio metric indicating the active time horizon of attacks. Subsequently, we propose a trust scoring model based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, that embeds the appropriate unbiased mean, the median absolute deviation, and the attack probability ratio metric at runtime to produce trust scores for each smart meter. These trust scores help classify compromised smart meters from the non-compromised ones. The embedding of the attack context, into the trust scoring model, facilitates accurate and rapid classification of compromised meters, even under large fractions of compromised meters, generalize across various attack strategies and margins of false data. Using real datasets collected from two different AMIs, experimental results show that our proposed framework has a high true positive detection rate, while the average false alarm and missed detection rates are much lesser than 10% for most attack combinations for two different real AMI micro-grid datasets. Finally, we also establish fundamental theoretical limits of the proposed method, which will help assess the applicability of our method to other domains.},

abstract = {In recent years, several schemes have been proposed to detect anomalies and attacks on Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) such as Industrial Control Systems (ICSs). Based on the analysis of sensor data, unexpected or malicious behavior is detected. Those schemes often rely on (implicit) assumptions on temporally stable sensor data distributions and invariants between process values. Unfortunately, the proposed schemes often perform not optimally with Recall scores lower than 70% (e.g., missing 3 alarms every 10 anomalies) for some ICS datasets, with unclear root issues.In this work, we propose a general framework to check whether a given ICS dataset has specific properties (stable sensor distributions in normal operations, potentially state-dependent), which then allows to determine whether certain Anomaly Detection approaches can be expected to perform well. We apply our framework to three datasets showing that the behavior of actuators and sensors are very different between Training set and Test set. In addition, we present high-level guides to consider when designing an Anomaly Detection System.},

abstract = {Each year, thousands of software vulnerabilities are discovered and reported to the public. Unpatched known vulnerabilities are a significant security risk. It is imperative that software vendors quickly provide patches once vulnerabilities are known and users quickly install those patches as soon as they are available. However, most vulnerabilities are never actually exploited. Since writing, testing, and installing software patches can involve considerable resources, it would be desirable to prioritize the remediation of vulnerabilities that are likely to be exploited. Several published research studies have reported moderate success in applying machine learning techniques to the task of predicting whether a vulnerability will be exploited. These approaches typically use features derived from vulnerability databases (such as the summary text describing the vulnerability) or social media posts that mention the vulnerability by name. However, these prior studies share multiple methodological shortcomings that inflate predictive power of these approaches. We replicate key portions of the prior work, compare their approaches, and show how selection of training and test data critically affect the estimated performance of predictive models.

abstract = {We examine the security of home smart locks: cyber-physical devices that replace traditional door locks with deadbolts that can be electronically controlled by mobile devices or the lock manufacturer's remote servers. We present two categories of attacks against smart locks and analyze the security of five commercially-available locks with respect to these attacks. Our security analysis reveals that flaws in the design, implementation, and interaction models of existing locks can be exploited by several classes of adversaries, allowing them to learn private information about users and gain unauthorized home access. To guide future development of smart locks and similar Internet of Things devices, we propose several defenses that mitigate the attacks we present. One of these defenses is a novel approach to securely and usably communicate a user's intended actions to smart locks, which we prototype and evaluate. Ultimately, our work takes a first step towards illuminating security challenges in the system design and novel functionality introduced by emerging IoT systems.},

abstract = {The safe operation of robotic aerial vehicles (RAV) requires effective security protection of their controllers against cyber-physical attacks. The frequency and sophistication of past attacks against such embedded platforms highlight the need for better defense mechanisms. Existing estimation-based control monitors have tradeoffs, with lightweight linear state estimators lacking sufficient coverage, and heavier data-driven learned models facing implementation and accuracy issues on a constrained real-time RAV. We present Mini-Me, a data-driven online monitoring framework that models the program-level control state dynamics to detect runtime data-oriented attacks against RAVs. Mini-Me leverages the internal dataflow information and control variable dependencies of RAV controller functions to train a neural network-based approximate model as the lightweight replica of the original controller programs. Mini-Me runs the minimal approximate model and detects malicious control state deviation by comparing the estimated outputs with those outputs calculated by the original controller program. We demonstrate Mini-Me on a widely adopted RAV physical model as well as popular RAV virtual models based on open-source firmware, ArduPilot and PX4, and show its effectiveness in detecting five types of attack cases with an average 0.34% space overhead and 2.6% runtime overhead. },

In particular, two novel threats were reviewed in depth: Workload-based EDoS (W-EDoS) and Instantiation-based EDoS (I-EDoS). With the aim to contribute to their mitigation a security architecture with network-based intrusion detection capabilities is proposed. This architecture implements machine learning techniques, network behaviour prediction, adaptive thresholding methods, and productivity-based clustering for detecting entropy-based anomalies based on the observed workload (W-EDoS) or suspicious variations of the productivity observed at the virtual instances (I-EDoS). A detailed experimentation has been conducted considering different calibration parameters under different network scenarios, on which the security architecture has been assessed. The results have proven good accuracy levels, hence demonstrating the proposal effectiveness.},

abstract = {Deep learning models are increasingly used in mobile applications as critical components. Unlike the program bytecode whose vulnerabilities and threats have been widely-discussed, whether and how the deep learning models deployed in the applications can be compromised are not well-understood since neural networks are usually viewed as a black box. In this paper, we introduce a highly practical backdoor attack achieved with a set of reverse-engineering techniques over compiled deep learning models. The core of the attack is a neural conditional branch constructed with a trigger detector and several operators and injected into the victim model as a malicious payload. The attack is effective as the conditional logic can be flexibly customized by the attacker, and scalable as it does not require any prior knowledge from the original model. We evaluated the attack effectiveness using 5 state-of-the-art deep learning models and real-world samples collected from 30 users. The results demonstrated that the injected backdoor can be triggered with a success rate of 93.5%, while only brought less than 2ms latency overhead and no more than 1.4% accuracy decrease. We further conducted an empirical study on real-world mobile deep learning apps collected from Google Play. We found 54 apps that were vulnerable to our attack, including popular and security-critical ones. The results call for the awareness of deep learning application developers and auditors to enhance the protection of deployed models.},

abstract = {Outlier detection is one of the main fields in machine learning and it has been growing rapidly due to its wide range of applications. In the last few years, deep learning-based methods have outperformed machine learning and handcrafted outlier detection techniques, and our method is no different. We present a new twist to generative models which leverages variational autoencoders as a source for uniform distributions which can be used to separate the inliers from the outliers. Both the generative and adversarial parts of the model are used to obtain three main losses (Reconstruction loss, KL-divergence, Discriminative loss) which in return are wrapped with a one-class SVM which is used to make the predictions. We evaluated our method against several datasets both for images and tabular data and it has shown great results for the zero-shot outlier detection problem and was able to easily generalize it for supervised outlier detection tasks on which the performance has increased. For comparison, we evaluated our method against several of the common outlier detection techniques such as DBSCAN-based outlier detection, GMM, K-means and one class SVM directly, and we have outperformed all of them on all datasets.},

abstract = {The popularity of cloud hosting services also brings in new security challenges: it has been reported that these services are increasingly utilized by miscreants for their malicious online activities. Mitigating this emerging threat, posed by such "bad repositories" (simply Bar), is challenging due to the different hosting strategy to traditional hosting service, the lack of direct observations of the repositories by those outside the cloud, the reluctance of the cloud provider to scan its customers' repositories without their consent, and the unique evasion strategies employed by the adversary. In this paper, we took the first step toward understanding and detecting this emerging threat. Using a small set of "seeds" (i.e., confirmed Bars), we identified a set of collective features from the websites they serve (e.g., attempts to hide Bars), which uniquely characterize the Bars. These features were utilized to build a scanner that detected over 600 Bars on leading cloud platforms like Amazon, Google, and 150K sites, including popular ones like groupon.com, using them. Highlights of our study include the pivotal roles played by these repositories on malicious infrastructures and other important discoveries include how the adversary exploited legitimate cloud repositories and why the adversary uses Bars in the first place that has never been reported. These findings bring such malicious services to the spotlight and contribute to a better understanding and ultimately eliminating this new threat.},

abstract = {Emerging Machine Learning (ML) techniques, such as Deep Neural Network, are widely used in today's applications and services. However, with social awareness of privacy and personal data rapidly rising, it becomes a pressing and challenging societal issue to both keep personal data private and benefit from the data analytics power of ML techniques at the same time. In this paper, we argue that to avoid those costs, reduce latency in data processing, and minimise the raw data revealed to service providers, many future AI and ML services could be deployed on users' devices at the Internet edge rather than putting everything on the cloud. Moving ML-based data analytics from cloud to edge devices brings a series of challenges. We make three contributions in this paper. First, besides the widely discussed resource limitation on edge devices, we further identify two other challenges that are not yet recognised in existing literature: lack of suitable models for users, and difficulties in deploying services for users. Second, we present preliminary work of the first systematic solution, i.e. Zoo, to fully support the construction, composing, and deployment of ML models on edge and local devices. Third, in the deployment example, ML service are proved to be easy to compose and deploy with Zoo. Evaluation shows its superior performance compared with state-of-art deep learning platforms and Google ML services.},

We introduce a SIEM-based knowledge graph which models global associations among entities observed in proxy and DNS logs, enriched with related open source intelligence (OSINT) and cyber threat intelligence (CTI). Next, we propose MalRank, a graph-based inference algorithm designed to infer a node maliciousness score based on its associations to other entities presented in the knowledge graph, e.g., shared IP ranges or name servers.After a series of experiments on real-world data captured from a global enterprise's SIEM (spanning over 3TB of disk space), we show that MalRank maintains a high detection rate (AUC = 96%) outperforming its predecessor, Belief Propagation, both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we show that this approach is effective in identifying previously unknown malicious entities such as malicious domain names and IP addresses. The system proposed in this research can be implemented in conjunction with an organization's SIEM, providing a maliciousness score for all observed entities, hence aiding SOC investigations.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide good performance in image recognition, speech recognition and pattern analysis. However, DNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Backdoor attacks allow attackers to proactively access training data of DNNs to train additional malicious data, including the specific trigger. In normal times, DNNs correctly classify the normal data, but the malicious data with the specific trigger trained by attackers can cause misclassification of DNNs. For example, if an attacker sets up a road sign that includes a specific trigger, an autonomous vehicle equipped with a DNN may misidentify the road sign and cause an accident. Thus, an attacker can use a backdoor attack to threaten the DNN at any time. However, this backdoor attack can be useful in certain situations, such as in military situations. Since there is a mixture of enemy and friendly force in the military situations, it is necessary to cause misclassification of the enemy equipment and classification of the friendly equipment. Therefore, it is necessary to make backdoor attacks that are correctly recognized by friendly equipment and misrecognized by the enemy equipment. In this paper, we propose a friendnet backdoor that is correctly recognized by friendly classifier and misclassified by the enemy classifier. This method additionally trains the friendly and enemy classifier with the proposed data, including the specific trigger that is correctly recognized by friendly classifier and misclassified by enemy classifier. We used MNIST and Fashion-MNIST as experimental datasets and Tensorflow as a machine learning library. Experimental results show that the proposed method in MNIST and Fashion-MNIST has 100% attack success rate of the enemy classifier and the 99.21% and 92.3% accuracy of the friendly classifier, respectively.},

In this paper, we tackle the problem of detecting whether a given URL is hosted by an exploit kit. Through an extensive analysis of the workflows of about 40 different exploit kits, we develop an approach that uses machine learning to detect whether a given URL is hosting an exploit kit. Central to our approach is the design of distinguishing features that are drawn from the analysis of attack-centric and self-defense behaviors of exploit kits. This design is based on observations drawn from exploit kits that we installed in a laboratory setting as well as live exploit kits that were hosted on the Web. We discuss the design and implementation of a system called WEBWINNOW that is based on this approach. Extensive experiments with real world malicious URLs reveal that WEBWINNOW is highly effective in the detection of malicious URLs hosted by exploit kits with very low false-positives.},

abstract = {Modern network infrastructures host converged applications that demand rapid elasticity of services, increased security, and ultra-fast reaction times. The Tactile Internet promises to facilitate the delivery of these services while enabling new economies of scale for high fidelity of machine-to-machine and human-to-machine interactions. Unavoidably, critical mission systems served by the Tactile Internet manifest high demands not only for high speed and reliable communications but equally, the ability to rapidly identify and mitigate threats and vulnerabilities. This article proposes a novel Multi-Agent Data Exfiltration Detector Architecture (MADEX), inspired by the mechanisms and features present in the human immune system. MADEX seeks to identify data exfiltration activities performed by evasive and stealthy malware that hides malicious traffic from an infected host in low-latency networks. Our approach uses cross-network traffic information collected by agents to effectively identify unknown illicit connections by an operating system subverted. MADEX does not require prior knowledge of the characteristics or behavior of the malicious code or a dedicated access to a knowledge repository. We tested the performance of MADEX in terms of its capacity to handle real-time data and the sensitivity of our algorithm’s classification when exposed to malicious traffic. Experimental evaluation results show that MADEX achieved 99.97% sensitivity, 98.78% accuracy, and an error rate of 1.21% when compared to its best rivals. We created a second version of MADEX, called MADEX level 2, that further improves its overall performance with a slight increase in computational complexity. We argue for the suitability of MADEX level 1 in non-critical environments, while MADEX level 2 can be used to avoid data exfiltration in critical mission systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article in the literature that addresses the detection of rootkits real-time in an agnostic way using an artificial immune system approach while it satisfies strict latency requirements.},

Such malicious data injections can be particularly difficult to detect if multiple sensors have been compromised as they could emulate plausible sensor behaviour such as failures or detection of events where none occur.

abstract = {Online advertising, also known as web advertising or Internet marketing, is the means and process of promoting products and services on the Internet, and it has been one of the important business models for the Internet. Due to its lucrative nature and its large scale of adoption, it has also been a target for malicious parties with various attack aims such as getting a cut of online advertising revenues, obtaining a user’s privacy, and spreading malware. Over the years, a great deal of research has been conducted on online advertising. Recently, the health of the online advertising ecosystem has become more of a concern for both advertisers and regular Internet users. Advertising budgets have been abused, and Internet users’ privacy and security have been infringed. In this article, we broadly study threats to online advertising and trace the root causes from a systems point of view. Existing threat mitigation strategies are also reviewed and analyzed. To protect online advertising, which has been an essential funding source of many free Internet services, several challenges still need to be addressed, including the need for transparency of the advertising ecosystem and software vulnerabilities on the client-side. To overcome these challenges, we conclude by brainstorming some innovative ideas on some potentially interesting and useful research directions.},

abstract = {With the advancement in technology and the increase in the number of digital sources, data quantity increases every day and, consequently, the cyber security related data quantity. Traditional security systems such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are not capable of handling such a growing amount of data set in real time. Cyber security analytics is an alternative solution to such traditional security systems, which can use big data analytics techniques to provide a faster and scalable framework to handle a large amount of cyber security related data in real time. k-means clustering is one of the commonly used clustering algorithms in cyber security analytics aimed at dividing security related data into groups of similar entities, which in turn can help in gaining important insights about the known and unknown attack patterns. This technique helps a security analyst to focus on the data specific to some clusters only for the analysis. To improve performance, k-means can exploit the triangle inequality to skip many point-center distance computations, without affecting the clustering results. In this paper, we re-formulate the parallel version of Elkan's k-means with triangle inequality (k-meansTI) algorithm, implement this algorithm on Apache Spark, and use it to classify Web attacks in different clusters. The paper also provides the speed comparison of our parallel k-meansTI on Spark with the Spark ML k-means clustering algorithm.},

abstract = {At the core of Network Functions Virtualization lie Network Functions (NFs) that run co-resident on the same server, contend over its hardware resources and, thus, might suffer from reduced performance relative to running alone on the same hardware. Therefore, to efficiently manage resources and meet performance SLAs, NFV orchestrators need mechanisms to predict contention-induced performance degradation. In this work, we find that prior performance prediction frameworks suffer from poor accuracy on modern architectures and NFs because they treat memory as a monolithic whole. In addition, we show that, in practice, there exist multiple components of the memory subsystem that can separately induce contention. By precisely characterizing (1) the pressure each NF applies on the server's shared hardware resources (contentiousness) and (2) how susceptible each NF is to performance drop due to competing contentiousness (sensitivity), we develop SLOMO, a multivariable performance prediction framework for Network Functions. We show that relative to prior work SLOMO reduces prediction error by 2-5x and enables 6-14% more efficient cluster utilization. SLOMO's codebase can be found at https://github.com/cmu-snap/SLOMO.},

title = {Quantifying and Improving the Efficiency of Hardware-Based Mobile Malware Detectors},
year = {2016},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Hardware-based malware detectors (HMDs) are a key emerging technology to build trustworthy systems, especially mobile platforms. Quantifying the efficacy of HMDs against malicious adversaries is thus an important problem. The challenge lies in that real-world malware adapts to defenses, evades being run in experimental settings, and hides behind benign applications. Thus, realizing the potential of HMDs as a small and battery-efficient line of defense requires a rigorous foundation for evaluating HMDs.We introduce Sherlock---a white-box methodology that quantifies an HMD's ability to detect malware and identify the reason why. Sherlock first deconstructs malware into atomic, orthogonal actions to synthesize a diverse malware suite. Sherlock then drives both malware and benign programs with real user-inputs, and compares their executions to determine an HMD's operating range, i.e., the smallest malware actions an HMD can detect.We show three case studies using Sherlock to not only quantify HMDs' operating ranges but design better detectors. First, using information about concrete malware actions, we build a discrete-wavelet transform based unsupervised HMD that outperforms prior work based on power transforms by 24.7% (AUC metric). Second, training a supervised HMD using Sherlock's diverse malware dataset yields 12.5% better HMDs than past approaches that train on ad-hoc subsets of malware. Finally, Sherlock shows why a malware instance is detectable. This yields a surprising new result---obfuscation techniques used by malware to evade static analyses makes them more detectable using HMDs.},

Further, the botmasters continuously try to improve their botnets in order to evade existing detection mechanisms. Thus, although a lot of research has been seen in this field, their detection continues to be an important area of research.This work proposes a novel approach for the detection of P2P botnets by converting the 'time-domain' network communications of P2P botnets to 'frequency-domain'. We adopt a signal-processing based approach by treating the traffic of each pair of nodes seen in network traffic as a 'signal'. Apart from the regular 'network behavior' based features, we extract features based on Discrete Fourier Transforms and Shannon's Entropy theory to build supervised machine learning models for the detection of P2P botnets. Herein we present encouraging results obtained from the preliminary experiments.},

abstract = {Cyber-security is an important societal concern. Cyber-attacks have increased in numbers as well as in the extent of damage caused in every attack. Large organizations operate a Cyber Security Operation Center (CSOC), which forms the first line of cyber-defense. The inspection of cyber-alerts is a critical part of CSOC operations (defender or blue team). Recent work proposed a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach for the defender’s decision-making to prevent the cyber-alert queue length from growing large and overwhelming the defender. In this article, we perform a red team (adversarial) evaluation of this approach. With the recent attacks on learning-based decision-making systems, it is even more important to test the limits of the defender’s RL approach. Toward that end, we learn several adversarial alert generation policies and the best response against them for various defender’s inspection policy. Surprisingly, we find the defender’s policies to be quite robust to the best response of the attacker. In order to explain this observation, we extend the earlier defender’s RL model to a game model with adversarial RL, and show that there exist defender policies that can be robust against any adversarial policy. We also derive a competitive baseline from the game theory model and compare it to the defender’s RL approach. However, when we go further to exploit the assumptions made in the Markov Decision Process (MDP) in the defender’s RL model, we discover an attacker policy that overwhelms the defender. We use a double oracle like approach to retrain the defender with episodes from this discovered attacker policy. This made the defender robust to the discovered attacker policy and no further harmful attacker policies were discovered. Overall, the adversarial RL and double oracle approach in RL are general techniques that are applicable to other RL usage in adversarial environments.},

abstract = {For many Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications, periodic transmission of beacon messages by a source vehicle is paramount for providing the unhindered service and to maintain its accuracy. A malicious source vehicle could deny beacon messages of a target ITS application and intelligently cover-up this denial with signal loss faced due to wireless channel error and surrounding environment obstacles. In this context, we propose a lightweight technique to detect a beacon denial attacker using Auto-Correlation Function (ACF). This technique possesses higher detection accuracy in comparison to fixed threshold scheme which depends upon the number of beacon messages denied by the source vehicle. Furthermore, we propose a random vehicle inspection scheme for inspecting randomly chosen set of vehicles for beacon denial attack. In addition to reducing computational overhead, the advantage of this scheme is that an attacker with knowledge about detection algorithm cannot decide the time and place of inspection. Simulation results confirm the accurate and lightweight nature of the proposed technique.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide good performance in image recognition, speech recognition, and pattern analysis. However, DNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Backdoor attacks allow attackers to proactively access DNN training data to train it on additional data that are malicious, including a specific trigger. Normally, DNNs correctly classify normal data, but malicious data with a specific trigger trained by attackers can cause misclassification by DNNs. For example, if an attacker sets up a road sign that includes a specific trigger, an autonomous vehicle equipped with a DNN may misidentify the road sign and cause an accident. Thus, an attacker can use a backdoor attack to threaten the DNN at any time. However, in certain cases, when an attacker wants to perform a targeted attack, it may be desirable for the data introduced through the backdoor to be misrecognized as a particular class chosen by the attacker according to the position of a trigger. For example, if a specific trigger is attached to the top right side of the road sign, it may be misunderstood as a left-turn sign; if a specific trigger is attached to the top left side of the road sign, it may be misunderstood as a right-turn sign; and if a specific trigger is attached to the bottom left side of the road sign, it may be misunderstood as a U-turn sign. In this paper, we propose the TargetNet backdoor, which is designed to be misidentified as a particular target class chosen by the attacker according to a specific trigger location. The proposed method additionally trains the target classifier on the TargetNet backdoor data so that data with a trigger at a specific location will be misidentified as the target class selected by the attacker. We used MNIST and Fashion-MNIST as experimental datasets and Tensor-flow as a machine learning library. Experimental results show that the proposed method applied to MNIST and Fashion-MNIST has a 100% attack success rate for the TargetNet backdoor and 99.17% and 91.4% accuracy rates on normal test data, respectively.},

abstract = {For well over a quarter century, detection systems have been driven by models learned from input features collected from real or simulated environments. An artifact (e.g., network event, potential malware sample, suspicious email) is deemed malicious or non-malicious based on its similarity to the learned model at runtime. However, the training of the models has been historically limited to only those features available at runtime. In this paper, we consider an alternate learning approach that trains models using privileged information--features available at training time but not at runtime--to improve the accuracy and resilience of detection systems. In particular, we adapt and extend recent advances in knowledge transfer, model influence, and distillation to enable the use of forensic or other data unavailable at runtime in a range of security domains. An empirical evaluation shows that privileged information increases precision and recall over a system with no privileged information: we observe up to 7.7% relative decrease in detection error for fast-flux bot detection, 8.6% for malware traffic detection, 7.3% for malware classification, and 16.9% for face recognition. We explore the limitations and applications of different privileged information techniques in detection systems. Such techniques provide a new means for detection systems to learn from data that would otherwise not be available at runtime.},

abstract = {The threat of attack faced by cyber-physical systems (CPSs), especially when they play a critical role in automating public infrastructure, has motivated research into a wide variety of attack defence mechanisms. Assessing their effectiveness is challenging, however, as realistic sets of attacks to test them against are not always available. In this paper, we propose smart fuzzing, an automated, machine learning guided technique for systematically finding 'test suites' of CPS network attacks, without requiring any knowledge of the system's control programs or physical processes. Our approach uses predictive machine learning models and metaheuristic search algorithms to guide the fuzzing of actuators so as to drive the CPS into different unsafe physical states. We demonstrate the efficacy of smart fuzzing by implementing it for two real-world CPS testbeds---a water purification plant and a water distribution system---finding attacks that drive them into 27 different unsafe states involving water flow, pressure, and tank levels, including six that were not covered by an established attack benchmark. Finally, we use our approach to test the effectiveness of an invariant-based defence system for the water treatment plant, finding two attacks that were not detected by its physical invariant checks, highlighting a potential weakness that could be exploited in certain conditions.},

A typical cloudoscopy attack is composed of a number of steps: first expose the internal IP address of a victim instance, then measure its hop-count distance from adversarial cloud instances, and finally test to find a specific instance which is close enough to the victim (e.g., co-resident) to allow (denial of service or side-channel) attacks. We refer to the three steps/modules involved in such cloudoscopy attack by the terms IP address deanonymisation, hop-count measuring, and co-residence testing.We present specific methods for these three cloudoscopy modules, and report on results of our experimental validation on popular cloud platform providers. Our techniques can be used for attacking (victim) servers, as well as for benign goals, e.g., optimisation of instances placement and communication, or comparing clouds and validating cloud-provider placement guarantees.},

abstract = {In Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) networks, power data collections from smart meters are static. Due to such static nature, attackers may predict the transmission behavior of the smart meters which can be used to launch selective jamming attacks that can block the transmissions. To avoid such attack scenarios and increase the resilience of the AMI networks, in this paper, we propose dynamic data reporting schedules for smart meters based on the idea of moving target defense (MTD) paradigm. The idea behind MTD-based schedules is to randomize the transmission times so that the attackers will not be able to guess these schedules. Specifically, we assign a time slot for each smart meter and in each round we shuffle the slots with Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm that has been shown to provide secure randomness. We also take into account the periodicity of the data transmissions that may be needed by the utility company. With the proposed approach, a smart meter is guaranteed to send its data at a different time slot in each round. We implemented the proposed approach in ns-3 using IEEE 802.11s wireless mesh standard as the communication infrastructure. Simulation results showed that our protocol can secure the network from the selective jamming attacks without sacrificing performance by providing similar or even better performance for collection time, packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay compared to previously proposed protocols.},

This technique classifies a system as either clean or infected at runtime as measurements are collected from the sensors. We provide experimental results that illustrate the effectiveness of this technique for a selection of malware samples.

abstract = {Various system metrics have been proposed for measuring the quality of computer-based systems, such as dependability and security metrics for estimating their performance and security characteristics. As computer-based systems grow in complexity with many subsystems or components, measuring their quality in multiple dimensions is a challenging task. In this work, we tackle the problem of measuring the quality of computer-based systems based on the four key attributes of trustworthiness we developed: security, trust, resilience, and agility. In addition to conducting a systematic survey on metrics, measurements, attributes of metrics, and associated ontologies, we propose a system-level trustworthiness metric framework that accommodates four submetrics, called STRAM (<u>S</u>ecurity, <u>T</u>rust, <u>R</u>esilience, and <u>A</u>gility <u>M</u>etrics). The proposed STRAM framework offers a hierarchical ontology structure where each submetric is defined as a sub-ontology. Moreover, this work proposes developing and incorporating metrics describing key assessment tools, including vulnerability assessment, risk assessment, and red teaming, to provide additional evidence in the measurement and quality of trustworthy systems. We further discuss how assessment tools are related to measuring the quality of computer-based systems and the limitations of the state-of-the-art metrics and measurements. Finally, we suggest future research directions for system-level metrics research toward measuring fundamental attributes of the quality of computer-based systems and improving the current metric and measurement methodologies.},

abstract = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have promoted a variety of applications in computer vision and natural language processing, among others, due to its generative model’s compelling ability to generate realistic examples plausibly drawn from an existing distribution of samples. GAN not only provides impressive performance on data generation-based tasks but also stimulates fertilization for privacy and security oriented research because of its game theoretic optimization strategy. Unfortunately, there are no comprehensive surveys on GAN in privacy and security, which motivates this survey to summarize systematically. The existing works are classified into proper categories based on privacy and security functions, and this survey conducts a comprehensive analysis of their advantages and drawbacks. Considering that GAN in privacy and security is still at a very initial stage and has imposed unique challenges that are yet to be well addressed, this article also sheds light on some potential privacy and security applications with GAN and elaborates on some future research directions.},

abstract = {Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has emerged as a framework for centralized command and control in cloud data centric environments. SDN separates data and control plane, which provides network administrator better visibility and policy enforcement capability compared to traditional networks. The SDN controller can assess reachability information of all the hosts in a network. There are many critical assets in a network which can be compromised by a malicious attacker through a multistage attack. Thus we make use of centralized controller to assess the security state of the entire network and pro-actively perform attack analysis and countermeasure selection. This approach is also known as Moving Target Defense (MTD). We use the SDN controller to assess the attack scenarios through scalable Attack Graphs (AG) and select necessary countermeasures to perform network reconfiguration to counter network attacks. Moreover, our framework has a comprehensive conflict detection and resolution module that ensures that no two flow rules in a distributed SDN-based cloud environment have conflicts at any layer; thereby assuring consistent conflict-free policy implementation and preventing information leakage.},

abstract = {Historically, enterprise network reconnaissance is an active process, often involving port scanning. However, as routers and switches become more complex, they also become more susceptible to compromise. From this vantage point, an attacker can passively identify high-value hosts such as the workstations of IT administrators, C-suite executives, and finance personnel. The goal of this paper is to develop a technique to deceive and dissuade such adversaries. We propose HoneyRoles, which uses honey connections to build metaphorical haystacks around the network traffic of client hosts belonging to high-value organizational roles. The honey connections also act as network canaries to signal network compromise, thereby dissuading the adversary from acting on information observed in network flows. We design a prototype implementation of HoneyRoles an OpenFlow SDN controller and evaluate its security using the PRISM probabilistic model checker. Our performance evaluation shows that HoneyRoles has a small effect on network request completion time, and security analysis demonstrates that once an alert is raised, HoneyRoles can quickly identify the compromised switch with high probability. In doing so, we show that role-based network deception is a promising approach for defending against adversaries in compromised network devices.},

There are numerous pilot projects of driverless public buses; some car manufacturers deliver their premium-level automobiles with advanced self-driving features. Thus, assuring the security of a Passenger–Autonomous Vehicle interaction arises as an important research topic, as along with opportunities, new cybersecurity risks and challenges occur that potentially may threaten Passenger’s privacy and safety on the roads. This study proposes an approach of the security requirements elicitation based on the developed threat model. Thus, information security risk management helps to fulfil one of the principles needed to protect data privacy - information security. We demonstrate the process of security requirements elicitation to mitigate arising security risks. The findings of the paper are case-oriented and are based on the literature review. They are applicable for AV system implementation used by ride-hailing service providers that enable supervisory AV control.},

abstract = {PowerShell is a command-line shell, supporting a scripting language. It is widely used in organizations for configuration management and task automation but is also increasingly used for launching cyber attacks against organizations, mainly because it is pre-installed on Windows machines and exposes strong functionality that may be leveraged by attackers. This makes the problem of detecting malicious PowerShell code both urgent and challenging. Microsoft's Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI), built into Windows 10, allows defending systems to scan all the code passed to scripting engines such as PowerShell prior to its execution. In this work, we conduct the first study of malicious PowerShell code detection using the information made available by AMSI. We present several novel deep-learning based detectors of malicious PowerShell code that employ pretrained contextual embeddings of words from the PowerShell "language". A contextual word embedding is able to project semantically-similar words to proximate vectors in the embedding space. A known problem in the cybersecurity domain is that labeled data is relatively scarce, in comparison with unlabeled data, making it difficult to devise effective supervised detection of malicious activity of many types. This is also the case with PowerShell code. Our work shows that this problem can be mitigated by learning a pretrained contextual embedding based on unlabeled data. We trained and evaluated our models using real-world data, collected using AMSI. The contextual embedding was learnt using a large corpus of unlabeled PowerShell scripts and modules collected from public repositories. Our performance analysis establishes that the use of unlabeled data for the embedding significantly improved the performance of our detectors. Our best-performing model uses an architecture that enables the processing of textual signals from both the character and token levels and obtains a true-positive rate of nearly 90% while maintaining a low false-positive rate of less than 0.1%.},

abstract = {Network middleboxes perform deep packet inspection (DPI) to detect anomalies and suspicious activities in network traffic. However, increasingly these traffic are encrypted and middleboxes can no longer make sense of them. A recent proposal by Sherry et al. (SIGCOMM 2015), named BlindBox, enables the middlebox to perform inspection in a privacy-preserving manner. BlindBox deploys garbled circuit to generate encrypted rules for the purpose of inspecting the encrypted traffic directly. However, the setup latency (which could be 97s on a ruleset of 3,000 as reported) and overhead size incurred by garbled circuit are high. Since communication can only be commenced after the encrypted rules being generated, such delay is intolerable in many real-time applications. In this work, we present PrivDPI, which reduces the setup delay while retaining similar privacy guarantee. Compared to BlindBox, for a ruleset of 3,000, our encrypted rule generation is 288x faster and requires 290,227x smaller overhead for the first session, and is even 1,036x faster and requires 3424,505x smaller overhead over 20 consecutive sessions. The performance gain is based on a new technique for generating encrypted rules as well as the idea of reusing intermediate results generated in previous sessions across subsequent sessions. This is in contrast to Blindbox which performs encrypted rule generation from scratch for every session. Nevertheless, PrivDPI is 6x slower in generating the encrypted traffic tokens, yet in our implementation, the token encryption rate of PrivDPI is more than 17,271 per second which is sufficient for many real-time applications. Moreover, the intermediate values generated in each session can be reused across subsequent sessions for repeated tokens, which could further speedup token encryption. Overall, our experiment shows that PrivDPI is practical and especially suitable for connections with short flows.},

In this paper, we systematically study the impact of these challenges as a set of research questions (i.e., hypotheses). We design an experimentation framework where we can reliably vary several parameters while evaluating ML-based Android malware detection approaches. The results from the experiments are then used to answer the research questions. Meanwhile, we also demonstrate the impact of some challenges on some existing ML-based approaches. The large (market-scale) dataset (benign and malicious apps) we use in the above experiments represents the real-world Android app security analysis scale. We envision this study to encourage the practice of employing a better evaluation strategy and better designs of future ML-based approaches for Android malware detection.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in computing systems and wireless communications have made healthcare systems more efficient than before. Modern healthcare devices can monitor and manage different health conditions of patients automatically without any manual intervention from medical professionals. Additionally, the use of implantable medical devices, body area networks, and Internet of Things technologies in healthcare systems improve the overall patient monitoring and treatment process. However, these systems are complex in software and hardware, and optimizing between security, privacy, and treatment is crucial for healthcare systems because any security or privacy violation can lead to severe effects on patients’ treatments and overall health conditions. Indeed, the healthcare domain is increasingly facing security challenges and threats due to numerous design flaws and the lack of proper security measures in healthcare devices and applications. In this article, we explore various security and privacy threats to healthcare systems and discuss the consequences of these threats. We present a detailed survey of different potential attacks and discuss their impacts. Furthermore, we review the existing security measures proposed for healthcare systems and discuss their limitations. Finally, we conclude the article with future research directions toward securing healthcare systems against common vulnerabilities.},

abstract = {The increase of the computational power in edge devices has enabled the penetration of distributed machine learning technologies such as federated learning, which allows to build collaborative models performing the training locally in the edge devices, improving the efficiency and the privacy for training of machine learning models, as the data remains in the edge devices. However, in some IoT networks the connectivity between devices and system components can be limited, which prevents the use of federated learning, as it requires a central node to orchestrate the training of the model. To sidestep this, peer-to-peer learning appears as a promising solution, as it does not require such an orchestrator. On the other side, the security challenges in IoT deployments have fostered the use of machine learning for attack and anomaly detection. In these problems, under supervised learning approaches, the training datasets are typically imbalanced, i.e. the number of anomalies is very small compared to the number of benign data points, which requires the use of re-balancing techniques to improve the algorithms' performance. In this paper, we propose a novel peer-to-peer algorithm,P2PK-SMOTE, to train supervised anomaly detection machine learning models in non-IID scenarios, including mechanisms to locally re-balance the training datasets via synthetic generation of data points from the minority class. To improve the performance in non-IID scenarios, we also include a mechanism for sharing a small fraction of synthetic data from the minority class across devices, aiming to reduce the risk of data de-identification. Our experimental evaluation in real datasets for IoT anomaly detection across a different set of scenarios validates the benefits of our proposed approach.},

But more serious are the threats to the user's security and privacy and consequently the operator's reputation. Therefore, it is crucial for operators to have adequate solutions to protect both their network and their customers against this kind of fraud. Unfortunately, so far there is no sufficiently efficient countermeasure against grey routes. This paper proposes a near real time SMS grey traffic detection which makes use of Counting Bloom Filters combined with blacklist and whitelist to detect SMS grey traffic on the fly and to block them. The proposed detection has been implemented and proved to be quite efficient. The paper provides also comprehensive explanation of SMS grey routes and the challenges in their detection. The implementation and verification are also described thoroughly.},

abstract = {Increasing incorporation of advanced information technologies makes business and public organisations more effective and efficient, while often introducing exploitable vulnerabilities. The efficient provision of security of interconnected, and interdependent, processes and sectors against cyberattacks requires deep understanding of vulnerabilities, exposure, potential negative impact, as well as the contribution existing and emerging organisational and technological solutions will potentially have on preventing attacks, reducing vulnerabilities, protecting digital infrastructures, response and recovery, and resilience. Such understanding will allow minimisation of risks against a spectrum of plausible cyber threats and reducing negative consequences of one or a series of cyberattacks.Due to the complexity of the problem, the effective implementation of a number of functions and tasks in designing and operating distributed cyber secure and resilient systems require significant computational resources. This paper outlines six highlevel, computationally demanding functions. The first three relate to the formulation and implementation of cybersecurity policy: understanding risk; planning and implementing cybersecurity measures; and continuous adaptation to the changing technological, threat and policy landscape. The other three functions are operational: situational awareness, including detection of cyberattacks and hybrid malicious activities; operational decision making, e.g. selecting a course of action under attack; and cyber forensics.},

abstract = {In the year, 2019, South African enterprises have seen a substantial increase in the number of cybersecurity incidents. From the public-sector to the private-sector, many enterprises have had to redirect large sums of their budgets towards responding to cybersecurity incidents that could have been averted. For most enterprises, having experienced, or seen the impact of a number of disclosed cybersecurity incidents in South Africa (SA) during 2019, the majority of enterprises had begun to strengthen their cybersecurity defenses in order to avert future cybersecurity incidents. To a large extent, most enterprises have implemented security measures such as firewalls, proxy gateways, patch management solutions, intrusions prevention or detection systems, encryption, network access control and so on. However, whilst these measures are implemented, in 2020, security architects saw a shift in the enterprise perimeter due to COVID-19 pandemic. Owing to the pandemic, on the 26th of March 2020, the South African government implemented a countrywide lock-down effectively enforcing all its citizens to stay at homes thus translating to an unintended remote workforce. During this time, employees found themselves overnight without any training working outside of the secured layered cybersecurity defenses of their enterprises. This arrangement negatively affected the security posture of many organizations. It effectively forced all enterprise employees to work from home, away from the secure enterprise network forcing information technology administrators to find ways to extend the enterprise perimeter in order to allow these inexperienced overnight remote workers to continue to securely work remotely. This article explores the consequences of the shift in the enterprise perimeter and also suggests practical technical steps that enterprises can apply in order to avert possible cybersecurity incidents.},

abstract = {It has been shown that adversaries can craft example inputs to neural networks which are similar to legitimate inputs but have been created to purposely cause the neural network to misclassify the input. These adversarial examples are crafted, for example, by calculating gradients of a carefully defined loss function with respect to the input. As a countermeasure, some researchers have tried to design robust models by blocking or obfuscating gradients, even in white-box settings. Another line of research proposes introducing a separate detector to attempt to detect adversarial examples. This approach also makes use of gradient obfuscation techniques, for example, to prevent the adversary from trying to fool the detector. In this paper, we introduce stochastic substitute training, a gray-box approach that can craft adversarial examples for defenses which obfuscate gradients. For those defenses that have tried to make models more robust, with our technique, an adversary can craft adversarial examples with no knowledge of the defense. For defenses that attempt to detect the adversarial examples, with our technique, an adversary only needs very limited information about the defense to craft adversarial examples. We demonstrate our technique by applying it against two defenses which make models more robust and two defenses which detect adversarial examples.},

Streamline automates optimization and only presents users a clear, concise job control language based on Unix pipelines.

abstract = {The quantity of personal data that is collected, stored, and subsequently processed continues to grow rapidly. Given its sensitivity, ensuring privacy protections has become a necessary component of database management. To enhance protection, a number of mechanisms have been developed, such as audit logging and alert triggers, which notify administrators about suspicious activities. However, this approach is limited. First, the volume of alerts is often substantially greater than the auditing capabilities of organizations. Second, strategic attackers can attempt to disguise their actions or carefully choose targets, thus hide illicit activities. In this article, we introduce an auditing approach that accounts for adversarial behavior by (1) prioritizing the order in which types of alerts are investigated and (2) providing an upper bound on how much resource to allocate for each type.Specifically, we model the interaction between a database auditor and attackers as a Stackelberg game. We show that even a highly constrained version of such problem is NP-Hard. Then, we introduce a method that combines linear programming, column generation, and heuristic searching to derive an auditing policy. On the synthetic data, we perform an extensive evaluation on the approximation degree of our solution with the optimal one. The two real datasets, (1) 1.5 months of audit logs from Vanderbilt University Medical Center and (2) a publicly available credit card application dataset, are used to test the policy-searching performance. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for searching the audit strategies, and our general approach significantly outperforms non-game-theoretic baselines.},

abstract = {The steady evolution of the Web has paved the way for miscreants to take advantage of vulnerabilities to embed malicious content into web pages. Up on a visit, malicious web pages steal sensitive data, redirect victims to other malicious targets, or cease control of victim's system to mount future attacks. Approaches to detect malicious web pages have been reactively effective at special classes of attacks like drive-by-downloads. However, the prevalence and complexity of attacks by malicious web pages is still worrisome. The main challenges in this problem domain are (1) fine-grained capturing and characterization of attack payloads (2) evolution of web page artifacts and (3) exibility and scalability of detection techniques with a fast-changing threat landscape. To this end, we proposed a holistic approach that leverages static analysis, dynamic analysis, machine learning, and evolutionary searching and optimization to effectively analyze and detect malicious web pages. We do so by: introducing novel features to capture fine-grained snapshot of malicious web pages, holistic characterization of malicious web pages, and application of evolutionary techniques to fine-tune learning-based detection models pertinent to evolution of attack payloads. In this paper, we present key intuition and details of our approach, results obtained so far, and future work.},

abstract = {The novel secret inaudible acoustic communication channel [11], referred to as the BackDoor channel, is a method of embedding inaudible signals in acoustic data that is likely to be processed by a trained deep neural net. In this paper we perform preliminary studies of the detectability of such a communication channel by deep learning algorithms that are trained on the original acoustic data used for such a secret exploit. The BackDoor channel embeds inaudible messages by modulating them with a sinewave of 40kHz and transmitting using ultrasonic speakers. The received composite signal is used to generate the Backdoor dataset for evaluation of our neural net. The audible samples are played back and recorded as a baseline dataset for training. The Backdoor dataset is used to evaluate the impact that the BackDoor channel has on the classification of the acoustic data, and we show that the accuracy of the classifier is degraded. The degradation depends on the type of deep classifier and it appears to impact less the classifiers that are trained using autoencoders. We also propose statistics that can be used to detect the out-of-distribution samples created as a result of the BackDoor channel, such as the log likelihood of the variational autoencoder used to pre-train the classifier or the empirical entropy of the classifier's output layer. The preliminary results presented in this paper indicate that the use of deep learning classifiers as detectors of the BackDoor secret channel merits further research.},

abstract = {Provenance-based causal analysis of audit logs has proven to be an invaluable method of investigating system intrusions. However, it also suffers from dependency explosion, whereby long-running processes accumulate many dependencies that are hard to unravel. Execution unit partitioning addresses this by segmenting dependencies into units of work, such as isolating the events that processed a single HTTP request. Unfortunately, we discover that current designs have a semantic gap problem due to how system calls and application log messages are used to infer complex internal program states. We demonstrate how attackers can modify existing code exploits to control event partitioning, breaking links in the attack and framing innocent users. We also show how our techniques circumvent existing program and log integrity defenses.We then propose a new design for execution unit partitioning that leverages additional runtime data to yield verified partitions that resist manipulation. Our design overcomes the technical challenges of minimizing additional overhead while accurately connecting low level code instructions to high level audit events, in part with the use of commodity hardware processor tracing. We implement a prototype of our design for Linux, MARSARA, and extensively evaluate it on 14 real-world programs, targeted with expertly crafted exploits. MARSARA's verified partitions successfully capture all the attack provenances while only reintroducing 2.82% of false dependencies, in the worst case, with an average overhead of 8.7%. Using a new metric called Partitioning Attack Surface, we show that MARSARA eliminates 47,642 more repartitioning gadgets per program than integrity defenses like CFI, demonstrating our prototype's effectiveness and the novelty of the attacks it prevents.},

abstract = {Red teams play a critical part in assessing the security of a network by actively probing it for weakness and vulnerabilities. Unlike penetration testing - which is typically focused on exploiting vulnerabilities - red teams assess the entire state of a network by emulating real adversaries, including their techniques, tactics, procedures, and goals. Unfortunately, deploying red teams is prohibitive: cost, repeatability, and expertise all make it difficult to consistently employ red team tests. We seek to solve this problem by creating a framework for automated red team emulation, focused on what the red team does post-compromise - i.e., after the perimeter has been breached. Here, our program acts as an automated and intelligent red team, actively moving through the target network to test for weaknesses and train defenders. At its core, our framework uses an automated planner designed to accurately reason about future plans in the face of the vast amount of uncertainty in red teaming scenarios. Our solution is custom-developed, built on a logical encoding of the cyber environment and adversary profiles, using techniques from classical planning, Markov decision processes, and Monte Carlo simulations. In this paper, we report on the development of our framework, focusing on our planning system. We have successfully validated our planner against other techniques via a custom simulation. Our tool itself has successfully been deployed to identify vulnerabilities and is currently used to train defending blue teams.},

By arbitrarily modifying pixels within a small restricted area in the image, adversarial patches can mislead neural-network-based image classifiers. In this paper, we propose a simple but very effective approach to detect adversarial patches based on an interesting observation called global-local consistency. We verify this insight and propose to use Random-Local-Ensemble (RLE) strategy to further enhance it in the detection. The proposed method is trivial to implement and can be applied to protect any image classification models. Experiments on two popular datasets show that our algorithm can accurately detect the adversarial patches while maintaining high clean accuracy. Moreover, unlike the prior detection approaches which can be easily broken by adaptive attacks, our method is proved to have high robustness when facing adaptive attacks.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of anomaly detection with a small set of partially labeled anomaly examples and a large-scale unlabeled dataset. This is a common scenario in many important applications. Existing related methods either exclusively fit the limited anomaly examples that typically do not span the entire set of anomalies, or proceed with unsupervised learning from the unlabeled data. We propose here instead a deep reinforcement learning-based approach that enables an end-to-end optimization of the detection of both labeled and unlabeled anomalies. This approach learns the known abnormality by automatically interacting with an anomaly-biased simulation environment, while continuously extending the learned abnormality to novel classes of anomaly (i.e., unknown anomalies) by actively exploring possible anomalies in the unlabeled data. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the exploitation of the small labeled anomaly data and the exploration of the rare unlabeled anomalies. Extensive experiments on 48 real-world datasets show that our model significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art competing methods.},

Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), which is one of the main components of the smart grid, represents an important branch of services with increasing deployments that also introduce new security risks. The nodes of AMIs are featured as resource-constrained. Therefore, security attacks including data integrity attacks on AMIs are of serious concern and require efficient selection of protective strategies. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game framework that models integrity attacks and defenses in an AMI. The aim of this framework is to study possible behaviors of adversaries and to define how the AMI nodes can adaptively select their strategies with maximum payoffs of the nodes. We present a case study and illustrate how the framework can be applied to investigate the integrity threats in AMI systems. We show the evolution process, based on the replicator dynamic.},

abstract = {Any malware designed to be controlled by a remote system (as required for a botnet) must establish command and control (C&amp;C) with that system. As part of establishing and maintaining C&amp;C, botnet malware will often send regular messages to the locations of potential C&amp;C servers, a practice known as beaconing. To avoid detection of these beacons, this traffic will be obfuscated and encrypted. Security researchers have had success with detecting beaconing by looking for traffic at regular time intervals, but malware authors are now introducing variation in these time intervals to foil this. Our research proposes that the regularity of both communication time intervals and data size are a useful feature set for detecting these C&amp;C channels. To quantify the regularity of these streams of data, we use a nearest-neighbour estimate of entropy that is simple and quick to calculate. We then measure mean, standard deviation and entropy for time intervals and data sizes of a series of connections between a source and a destination. These features are then used as input to a support vector machine which is trained to detect botnet C&amp;C activity. This approach was tested on the ISOT dataset---a dataset containing a mix of both benign and malicious real-world traffic. Using these features, we were able to train this classifier to accurately detect a large proportion of the botnet traffic.},

A survey study designed to test the model and hypotheses reveals that the effects of affordances on ISI professionals' intentions to use and collaborate are mediated by perceived usefulness and ease of use, which then jointly determine their perceived value. This study advances ISI research by specifying three important affordances of OADRs; it also contributes to extant technology adoption literature by scrutinizing and affirming the interplay of essential user acceptance and value perceptions to explain ISI professionals' adoptions of OADRs.},

abstract = {In view of the problems of the existing malicious code detection methods in heavy dependence on manual feature extraction and failure to extract the deep features of malicious codes, a malicious code detection method based on Bi-GRU and self-attention was proposed. First of all, the malicious code file was converted into the byte stream sequences of the same length, with each byte element (ranging from [0x00, 0xff]) represented by one-hot encoding. The features of the sequences were fully learnt by Bi-GRU according to their contextual hidden states. The hidden states of all time steps were output. Then, the hidden states of malicious time steps were assigned with more weights by using the self-attention mechanism, and the linear weighted sum of the hidden states were taken as the deep feature representation of the sample sequence. Finally, the feature representation was input to the fully connected neural network layer and the softmax layer to output the prediction probability of the sample. According to the experimental results, the AR of the proposed method increased by 12.25%, and its FPR reduced by 66.42% compared with the sub-optimal results. Thus, the method was feasible.},

abstract = {Tree data analysis has many applications in information security. In particular, HTML pages' DOM trees are an important target of analysis because web pages can be vectors for, and targets of, major cyberattacks like phishing. Previous attempts to incorporate tree data analysis into security applications, however, have been hampered by the lack of efficient methods for tree data analysis in machine learning. As such, most security research has focused on data representable as vectors of real numbers, like most machine learning work. Recent work, however, has yielded several efficiency break-throughs in tree analysis. One example is kernel methods, a methodological bridge that fills the gap between discretely-structured data (like trees) and multivariate analysis. Kernel methods enable applying a variety of multivariate analysis techniques such as SVM and PCA to trees. The method we are interested in is the subpath kernel. The subpath kernel offers the following advantages: (1) it is invariant over ordered and unordered trees; (2) it can be computed using an extremely fast linear-time algorithm compared to the quadratic time required to compute values of most tree kernels; (3) its excellent prediction accuracy has been proven through intensive experiments. This paper proposes a subpath kernel-based method for tree-structured security data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we apply it to the problem of detecting fake e-commerce sites, a sub-problem of phishing detection with a significant real-world financial cost. In an experiment on a real dataset of fake sites provided by a major e-commerce company, our method exhibited accuracy as high as 0.998 when training SVM with as few as 1,000 instances. Its generalization efficiency is also excellent: with only 100 training instances, the accuracy score reaches 0.996. While previous phishing detection methods relied on textual content, URL components, and blacklists, our approach is the first to leverage DOM trees, which makes it both more effective and more robust against adversarial attacks. Unlike URL or content changes, changing a page's DOM structure incurs large costs to criminals.},

abstract = {The lack of agility in cyber defense gives adversaries a significant advantage for discovering cyber targets and planning their attacks in stealthy and undetectable manner. While there has been significant research on detecting or predicting attacks, adversaries can always scan the network, learn about countermeasures, and develop new evasion techniques. Active Cyber Deception (ACD) has emerged as effective means to reverse this asymmetry in cyber warfare by dynamically orchestrating the cyber deception environment to mislead attackers and corrupting their decision-making process. However, developing an efficient active deception environment usually requires human intelligence and analysis to characterize the attackers' behaviors (e.g., malware actions). This manual process significantly limits the capability of cyber deception to actively respond to new attacks (malware) in a timely manner.In this paper, we present a new analytic framework and an implemented prototype, called gExtractor, to analyze the malware behavior and automatically extract the deception parameters using symbolic execution in order to enable the automated creation of cyber deception schemes. The deception parameters are environmental variables on which attackers depend to discover the target system and reach their goals; Yet, they can be reconfigured and/or misrepresented by the defender in the cyber environment. Our gExtractor approach contributes to the scientific and system foundations of reasoning about autonomous cyber deception. Our prototype was developed based on customizing a symbolic execution engine for analyzing Microsoft Windows malware. Our case studies of recent malware instances show that gExtractor can be used to identify various critical parameters effective for cyber deception.},

abstract = {In recent years, many researchers have begun to use commercial WiFi for pioneering work such as indoor positioning, human activity recognition, and WiFi imaging. Nevertheless, these tasks are generally not available across scenes. In order to solve this problem, we cut into the issue of activity recognition and propose WiTransfer, a cross-scene transfer recognition system based on commercial WiFi. We use commercial WiFi equipment to collect channel state information (CSI) data and input the CSI into a fully convolutional neural network for the training of source scene activity recognition models. Finally, we use the transfer learning mechanism to adapt the model to another scene, realize parameter sharing, and perform cross-scene activity recognition. We used three datasets (including five scenes) for experimental evaluation. Experimental results show that WiTransfer can achieve extremely high recognition accuracy, and the accuracy of three scenes when training from scratch is over 99%. When adapting to new scenes, WiTransfer can maintain or even improve the recognition accuracy, and can also reduce the training time and calculation cost of transfer.},

abstract = {Ransomeware is the most prevalent malicious software in 2017 that encrypts the files in a victim's machine and demands money, i.e., ransom, for decrypting the files. The global damage cost and financial losses of individuals and organizations due to ransomware is increasing year by year. Therefore, fighting against ransomware is an urgent issue. In this paper, we propose a ransomware detection scheme using support vector machines (SVMs), which is one of supervised machine learning algorithms. The key idea of the proposed scheme is to let a SVM learn the API calls of ransomware as its features so that the SVM detects unseen ransomware. Unlike the existing solutions, our scheme looks into the API call history in more detail. The testbeds using real 276 ransomware with San-box demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves the correct detection rate of ransomware.},

abstract = {Resource constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are highly likely to be compromised by attackers, because strong security protections may not be suitable to be deployed. This requires an alternative approach to protect vulnerable components in IoT networks. In this article, we propose an integrated defense technique to achieve intrusion prevention by leveraging cyberdeception (i.e., a decoy system) and moving target defense (i.e., network topology shuffling). We evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed technique analytically based on a graphical security model in a software-defined networking (SDN)-based IoT network. We develop four strategies (i.e., fixed/random and adaptive/hybrid) to address “when” to perform network topology shuffling and three strategies (i.e., genetic algorithm/decoy attack path-based optimization/random) to address “how” to perform network topology shuffling on a decoy-populated IoT network, and we analyze which strategy can best achieve a system goal, such as prolonging the system lifetime, maximizing deception effectiveness, maximizing service availability, or minimizing defense cost. We demonstrated that a software-defined IoT network running our intrusion prevention technique at the optimal parameter setting prolongs system lifetime, increases attack complexity of compromising critical nodes, and maintains superior service availability compared with a counterpart IoT network without running our intrusion prevention technique. Further, when given a single goal or a multi-objective goal (e.g., maximizing the system lifetime and service availability while minimizing the defense cost) as input, the best combination of “when” and “how” strategies is identified for executing our proposed technique under which the specified goal can be best achieved.},

Even outside academic research, there is a need for sharing network captures to cooperate on threat assessments or for debugging. However, most network captures cannot be shared due to privacy concerns.Anonymisation of network captures has been a subject of research for quite some time, and many different techniques exist. In this article, we present an overview of the currently available techniques and implementations for network capture anonymisation.There have been many advances in the understanding of anonymisation and cryptographic methods, which have changed the perspective on the effectiveness of many anonymisation techniques. However, these advances, combined with the increase of computational abilities, may have also made it feasible to perform anonymisation in real time. This may make it easier to collect and distribute network captures both for research and for other applications.<!--?tight?-->This article surveys the literature over the period of 1998–2017 on network traffic anonymisation techniques and implementations. The aim is to provide an overview of the current state of the art and to highlight how advances in related fields have shed new light on anonymisation and pseudonimisation methodologies. The few currently maintained implementations are also reviewed. Last, we identify future research directions to enable easier sharing of network traffic, which in turn can enable new insights in network traffic analysis.},

abstract = {Network traffic classification is the process of analyzing traffic flows and associating them to different categories of network applications. Network traffic classification represents an essential task in the whole chain of network security. Some of the most important and widely spread applications of traffic classification are the ability to classify encrypted traffic, the identification of malicious traffic flows, and the enforcement of security policies on the use of different applications. Passively monitoring a network utilizing low-cost and low-complexity wireless local area network WLAN devices is desirable. Mobile devices can be used or existing office desktops can be temporarily utilized when their computational load is low. This reduces the burden on existing network hardware. The aim of this paper is to investigate traffic classification techniques for wireless communications. To aid with intrusion detection, the key goal is to passively monitor and classify different traffic types over WLAN to ensure that network security policies are adhered to. The classification of encrypted WLAN data poses some unique challenges not normally encountered in wired traffic. WLAN traffic is analyzed for features that are then used as an input to six different machine learning ML algorithms for traffic classification. One of these algorithms a Gaussian mixture model incorporating a universal background model has not been applied to wired or wireless network classification before. The authors also propose a ML algorithm that makes use of the well-known vector quantization algorithm in conjunction with a decision tree—referred to as a TRee Adaptive Parallel Vector Quantiser. This algorithm has a number of advantages over the other ML algorithms tested and is suited to wireless traffic classification. An average F-score harmonic mean of precision and recall &gt; 0.84 was achieved when training and testing on the same day across six distinct traffic types.},

abstract = {To handle the large number of malware samples appearing in the wild each day, security analysts and vendors employ automated tools to detect, classify and analyze malicious code. Because malware is typically resistant to static analysis, automated dynamic analysis is widely used for this purpose. Executing malicious software in a controlled environment while observing its behavior can provide rich information on a malware's capabilities. However, running each malware sample even for a few minutes is expensive. For this reason, malware analysis efforts need to select a subset of samples for analysis. To date, this selection has been performed either randomly or using techniques focused on avoiding re-analysis of polymorphic malware variants [41, 23].In this paper, we present a novel approach to sample selection that attempts to maximize the total value of the information obtained from analysis, according to an application-dependent scoring function. To this end, we leverage previous work on behavioral malware clustering [14] and introduce a machine-learning-based system that uses all statically-available information to predict into which behavioral class a sample will fall, before the sample is actually executed. We discuss scoring functions tailored at two practical applications of large-scale dynamic analysis: the compilation of network blacklists of command and control servers and the generation of remediation procedures for malware infections. We implement these techniques in a tool called ForeCast. Large-scale evaluation on over 600,000 malware samples shows that our prototype can increase the amount of potential command and control servers detected by up to 137% over a random selection strategy and 54% over a selection strategy based on sample diversity.},

Firstly, the attack vector is generated and transformed by using the HMM model and code obfuscation strategy to obtain the test attack data set. Using sample preprocessing, all sample data sets are processed by normalization and word segmentation to reduce redundant information. Secondly, Word2vec is used to convert the preprocessing results into word embedding, and the relationship between HTML tags and DOM methods is obtained, and the network structure is reduced. The complexity is further studied by constructing four convolutional layers to learn and extract semantic features, and to achieve effective classification through the SOFTMAX layer. The experimental results show that the proposed method reduces the false positive rate and improves the detection accuracy.},

abstract = {Technology has grown rapidly since the end of the last century. Thousands of businesses from different major industries are transforming into information organizations and offering online services. The industrial and enterprise of Internet of Things (IoT) is growing at an exponential rate. Incident Command Systems (ICS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), which were once known to be untouchable by malware as they were usually available offline, are now facing security challenges. These systems become more vulnerable as their online availability increases to enable integration with other systems. Technology allows organizations to provide greater value to customers, expand their businesses beyond physical boundaries, and compete with other businesses. However, technology also allows attackers from all over the world to attack organizations and consumers. Ransomware, a type of malware, is a growing cybersecurity threat. It mainly targets home users and businesses for financial gain. Ransomware attacks often start with a delivery phase in which attackers deliver malicious content. Attackers often use multiple threat vectors for ransomware enablement such as emails, instant messages, and drive-by downloads, exploiting the vulnerabilities of a network or application. Among these attack vectors, email is the top threat vector, which most ransomware attackers attempt to use. This study proposes the use of a phishing detector application, PhAttApp. This application offers numerous features to detect and prevent ransomware delivery through phishing channels and thus reduces the risk of ransomware infection.},

abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are robust against intra-class variability of images, pose variations and random noise, but vulnerable to imperceptible adversarial perturbations that are well-crafted precisely to mislead. While random noise even of relatively large magnitude can hardly affect predictions, adversarial perturbations of very small magnitude can make a classifier fail completely. To enhance robustness, we introduce a new adversarial defense called patch replacement, which transforms both the input images and their intermediate features at early layers to make adversarial perturbations behave similarly to random noise. We decompose images/features into small patches and quantize them according to a codebook learned from legitimate training images. This maintains the semantic information of legitimate images, while removing as much as possible the effect of adversarial perturbations. Experiments show that patch replacement improves robustness against both white-box and gray-box attacks, compared with other transformation-based defenses. It has a low computational cost since it does not need training or fine-tuning the network. Importantly, in the white-box scenario, it increases the robustness, while other transformation-based defenses do not.},

abstract = {With the spread of new and innovative Internet services such as SIP-based communications, the challenge of protecting and defending these critical applications has been raised. In particular, SIP firewalls attempt to filter the signaling unwanted activities and attacks based on the knowledge of the SIP protocol. Optimizing the SIP firewall configuration at real-time by selecting the best filtering rules is problematic because it depends on both natures of the legal traffic and the unwanted activities. More precisely, we do not know exactly how the unwanted activities are reflected in the SIP messages and in what they differ from the legal ones. In this paper, we address the case of Spam over Internet Telephony (SPIT) mitigation.We propose an adaptive solution based on extracting signatures from learnt decision trees. Our simulations show that quickly learning the optimal configuration for a SIP firewall leads to reduce at lowest the unsolicited calls as reported by the users under protection. Our results promote the application of machine learning algorithms for supporting network and service resilience against such new challenges.},

abstract = {Network security incidents are complex and unstructured, making them difficult to understand and share. In this paper, we analyzes the commonality between structured threat information representation (STIX) and network security domain knowledge, and proposes a knowledge graph ontology modeling method of network security based on STIX. With the architecture knowledge of STIX, this method generates an ontology schema of network security knowledge graph, through classifying the concepts in the field of network security, describing the attributes of concepts and combing the relationships between concepts. The ontology schema has small redundancy and strong structural hierarchy, and can clearly display the structure of the attack activity and the mutual relationship. Therefore, it can help decision makers to understand security incidents more deeply, and help them make reasonable decisions and share cyber threat intelligence.},

abstract = {Traditional network control planes can be slow and require manual tinkering from operators to change their behavior. There is thus great interest in a faster, data-driven approach that uses signals from real-time traffic instead. However, the promise of fast and automatic reaction to data comes with new risks: malicious inputs designed towards negative outcomes for the network, service providers, users, and operators.Adversarial inputs are a well-recognized problem in other areas; we show that networking applications are susceptible to them too. We characterize the attack surface of data-driven networks and examine how attackers with different privileges---from infected hosts to operator-level access---may target network infrastructure, applications, and protocols. To illustrate the problem, we present case studies with concrete attacks on recently proposed data-driven systems.Our analysis urgently calls for a careful study of attacks and defenses in data-driven networking, with a view towards ensuring that their promise is not marred by oversights in robust design.},

We encode strategies as binary chromosomes representing finite state machines that evolve according to Holland's genetic algorithm. We study the strategic considerations including overall actor reward balanced against the complexity of the determined strategies.

How to detect malware attacks in a timely and effective manner becomes particularly important. The increasingly sophisticated malware calls for new defense technologies to detect and combat novelty attack and threats. In this paper, we propose a novel malware detection method that not only depends on API calls, further analyze the relationship between them and creates higher-level semantics to avoid attackers evading detection. We construct a heterogeneous information network (HIN) through their rich relationships between software and related APIs, and then use meta-path-based methods to describe the semantic relevance to software and APIs. We use each meta-path to calculate similarities between software and aggregate different similarities with Multi-kernel Learning (MKL) to construct a malware detection system. We collected real sample data and conducted a comprehensive experiment. Through experiments we have obtained a relatively high detection rate and a relatively low false detection rate, shows the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

So modern DDoS defense approaches are also based on sophisticated methods to classify HTTP requests. Usually, these methods require exhaustive data on user activity from different layers of protocol stack, mainly from network, transport and application layers.Moreover, a typical DDoS attack puts a huge load onto a target Web cluster. That demands a DDoS mitigation solution that delivers higher performance and is able to significantly reduce the load on defended back-end systems.In this article we present Tempesta, a hybrid solution that combines a caching HTTP server and a firewall in one. It accelerates Web applications much efficiently than traditional Web accelerators and provides a high performance framework that offers easy access to data from all protocol layers. That facilitates the development and use of sophisticated DDoS classification and blocking algorithms.},

abstract = {Mobile user profiles are a summary of characteristics of user-specific mobile activities. Mobile user profiling is to extract a user's interest and behavioral patterns from mobile behavioral data. While some efforts have been made for mobile user profiling, existing methods can be improved via representation learning with awareness of substructures in users' behavioral graphs. Specifically, in this paper, we study the problem of mobile users profiling with POI check-in data. To this end, we first construct a graph, where a vertex is a POI category and an edge is the transition frequency of a user between two POI categories, to represent each user. We then formulate mobile user profiling as a task of representation learning from user behavioral graphs. We later develop a deep adversarial substructured learning framework for the task. This framework has two mutually-enhanced components. The first component is to preserve the structure of the entire graph, which is formulated as an encoding-decoding paradigm. In particular, the structure of the entire graph is preserved by minimizing reconstruction loss between an original graph and a reconstructed graph. The second component is to preserve the structure of subgraphs, which is formulated as a substructure detector based adversarial training paradigm. In particular, this paradigm includes a substructure detector and an adversarial trainer. Instead of using non-differentiable substructure detection algorithms, we pre-train a differentiable convolutional neural network as the detector to approximate these detection algorithms. The adversarial trainer is to match the detected substructure of the reconstructed graph to the detected substructure of the original graph. Also, we provide an effective solution for the optimization problems. Moreover, we exploit the learned representations of users for the next activity type prediction. Finally, we present extensive experimental results to demonstrate the improved performances of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Malicious software, a threat users face on a daily basis, have evolved from simple bankers based on social engineering to advanced persistent threats. Recent research and discoveries reveal that malware developers have been using a wide range of anti-analysis and evasion techniques, in-memory attacks, and system subversion, including BIOS and hypervisors. In addition, code-reuse attacks like Returned Oriented Programming emerge as highly potential remote code execution threats. To counteract the broadness of malicious codes, distinct techniques and tools have been proposed, such as transparent malware tracers, system-wide debuggers, live forensics tools, and isolated execution rings. In this work, we present a survey on state-of-the-art techniques that detect, mitigate, and analyze the aforementioned attacks. We show approaches based on Hardware Virtual Machines introspection, System Management Mode instrumentation, Hardware Performance Counters, isolated rings (e.g., Software Guard eXtensions), as well as others based on external hardware. We also discuss upcoming threats based on the very same technologies used for defense.

For computer science, this has been a daunting task for a number of reasons, including the fast-paced evolution and expansion of the discipline, the perceived challenge of finding space in the curriculum, and the difficulty of selecting the best content. This paper takes the position that infusing security concepts pervasively into an undergraduate Computer Science program is a crucial and attainable best practice. A five-step methodology is presented to incorporate cybersecurity into a traditional computer science curriculum in a way that maintains disciplinary integrity without adding significant new curricular content. This methodology is consistent with the philosophy and recommendations of the latest computer science and cybersecurity curricular guidelines. The paper also illustrates the application of these techniques to a typical Computer Science program.},

abstract = {When designing computer monitoring systems, one goal has always been to have a complete view of the monitored target and at the same time stealthily protect the monitor itself. One way to achieve this is to use hypervisor-based, or more generally out of virtual machine (VM)-based, monitoring. There are, however, challenges that limit the use of this mechanism; the most significant of these is the semantic gap problem. Over the past decade, a considerable amount of research has been carried out to bridge the semantic gap and develop all kinds of out-of-VM monitoring techniques and applications. By tracing the evolution of out-of-VM security solutions, this article examines and classifies different approaches that have been proposed to overcome the semantic gap—the fundamental challenge in hypervisor-based monitoring—and how they have been used to develop various security applications. In particular, we review how the past approaches address different constraints, such as practicality, flexibility, coverage, and automation, while bridging the semantic gap; how they have developed different monitoring systems; and how the monitoring systems have been applied and deployed. In addition to systematizing all of the proposed techniques, we also discuss the remaining research problems and shed light on the future directions of hypervisor-based monitoring.},

abstract = {The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has quickly moved from the realm of hype to reality with estimates of over 25 billion devices deployed by 2020. While IoT has huge potential for societal impact, it comes with a number of key security challenges---IoT devices can become the entry points into critical infrastructures and can be exploited to leak sensitive information. Traditional host-centric security solutions in today's IT ecosystems (e.g., antivirus, software patches) are fundamentally at odds with the realities of IoT (e.g., poor vendor security practices and constrained hardware). We argue that the network will have to play a critical role in securing IoT deployments. However, the scale, diversity, cyberphysical coupling, and cross-device use cases inherent to IoT require us to rethink network security along three key dimensions: (1) abstractions for security policies; (2) mechanisms to learn attack and normal profiles; and (3) dynamic and context-aware enforcement capabilities. Our goal in this paper is to highlight these challenges and sketch a roadmap to avoid this impending security disaster.},

Alas, outsourcing network functions in its current setting implies that sensitive network policies, such as firewall rules, are revealed to the cloud provider. In this paper, we investigate the use of cryptographic primitives for processing outsourced network functions, so that the provider does not learn any sensitive information. More specifically, we present a cryptographic treatment of privacy-preserving outsourcing of network functions, introducing security definitions as well as an abstract model of generic network functions, and then propose a few instantiations using partial homomorphic encryption and public-key encryption with keyword search. We include a proof-of-concept implementation of our constructions and show that network functions can be privately processed by an untrusted cloud provider in a few milliseconds.},

abstract = { This study investigates the effect of a Message-of-the-Day (MOTD) system banner, written in three languages: English, Russian, and Chinese, on deterring unauthorized access to publicly accessible systems. Banners have been used in both the physical and cyberspace realms as a method of signalling to trespassers that the defending entity is aware of, and directing against, malicious activity. We created a honeypot infrastructure with three ssh servers for each language variant, and measured the attempts of unauthorized access over a course of a regular week. The results suggest that the MOTD banner written in Russian attracted at least twice as many attempts of unauthorized access as the English and Chinese MOTD banners. The Russian MOTD banner received 38% of the attempts from US IP addresses with 3.710 failed password login attempts per session and 51% of the attempts from Chinese IP addresses with 2.958 failed password login attempts per session on average. This ratio, on the English MOTD banner, was US IP addresses: 52%, 3.986 failed password login attempts and Chinese IP addresses: 27%, 2.367 failed password login attempts. On the Chinese MOTD banner this ratio was US IP addresses: 48%, 2.568 failed password login attempts and Chinese IP addresses: 27%, 2.858 failed password login attempts. We discuss the implications of these results for incorporating language variations in MOTD banners as a deterrence strategy.},

abstract = {This paper presents a geometrical model that projects malicious and benign events (e.g., attacks, security countermeasures) as pyramidal instances in a multidimensional coordinate system. The approach considers internal event data related to the target system (e.g., users, physical, and logical resources, IP addresses, port numbers, etc.), and external event data related to the attacker (e.g., knowledge, motivation, skills, etc.) that can be obtained a priori and a posteriori. Internal data is used to model the base of the pyramid, whereas external data is used to model its height. In addition, the approach considers state transitions taken by the attacker to model the steps of a multi-stage attack to reach to its final goal. As a result, for each modeled state, new countermeasures are evaluated and the attacker's knowledge a posteriori changes accordingly, making it possible to evaluate the impact of the attack at time Ti, where i denotes the stage at which the attack is executed. A graphical representation of the impact of each evaluated event is depicted for visualization purposes. A use case of a cyber-physical system is proposed at the end of the paper to illustrate the applicability of the proposed geometrical model.},

This paper presents a novel method, which aims at reducing and limiting the potential damage of a leakage that has already occurred. The main idea is to tag sensitive documents within the organization's boundaries by attaching a benign detectable malware signature (DMS). While the DMS is masked inside the organization, if a tagged document is somehow leaked out of the organization's boundaries, common security services such as Anti-Virus (AV) programs, firewalls or email gateways will detect the file as a real threat and will consequently delete or quarantine it, preventing it from spreading further. This paper discusses various aspects of the DMS, such as signature type and attachment techniques, along with proper design considerations and implementation issues. The proposed method was implemented and successfully tested on various file types including documents, spreadsheets, presentations, images, executable binaries and textual source code. The evaluation results have demonstrated its effectiveness in limiting the spread of leaked documents.},

abstract = {Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) commonly use stepping stone attacks that allow the adversary to move laterally undetected within an enterprise network towards a target. Existing network security techniques provide limited protection against such attacks, because they lack intra-network mediation and the context of information semantics. We propose PivotWall, a network security defense that extends information flow tracking on each host into network-level defenses. PivotWall uses a novel combination of information-flow tracking and Software Defined Networking (SDN) to detect a wide range of attacks used by advanced adversaries, including those that abuse both application- and network-layer protocols. It further enables a variety of attack responses including traffic steering, as well as advanced mechanisms for forensic analysis. We show that PivotWall incurs minimal impact on network throughput and latency for untainted traffic and less than 58% overhead for tainted traffic. As such, we demonstrate the utility of information flow tracking as a defense against advanced network-level attacks.},

abstract = {A novel scheme is proposed to authenticate sensors and detect data integrity attacks in a Cyber Physical System (CPS). The proposed technique uses the hardware characteristics of a sensor and physics of a process to create unique patterns (herein termed as fingerprints) for each sensor. The sensor fingerprint is a function of sensor and process noise embedded in sensor measurements. Uniqueness in the noise appears due to manufacturing imperfections of a sensor and due to unique features of a physical process. To create a sensor's fingerprint a system-model based approach is used. A noise-based fingerprint is created during the normal operation of the system. It is shown that under data injection attacks on sensors, noise pattern deviations from the fingerprinted pattern enable the proposed scheme to detect attacks. Experiments are performed on a dataset from a real-world water treatment (SWaT) facility. A class of stealthy attacks is designed against the proposed scheme and extensive security analysis is carried out. Results show that a range of sensors can be uniquely identified with an accuracy as high as 98%. Extensive sensor identification experiments are carried out on a set of sensors in SWaT testbed. The proposed scheme is tested on a variety of attack scenarios from the reference literature which are detected with high accuracy},

Then, we offer Zero-Residual Attacks (ZeRA), which allow the attacker to launch stealthy attacks leveraging estimation of the stateful anomaly detector and matching of residuals as a fraction of actual estimation residual. To perform the zero residual attack, the attacker will require the use of two state estimators each for the physical system state and the detector system state, adding complexity that was so far not discussed. We implement ZeRA and demonstrate its efficacy. Then, we propose to use a Stateful Detector (SD) to precisely detect such stealthy attacks. We design and implement the SD detector. The obtained results from the performance evaluation demonstrate that we can detect stealthy attacks such as the ZeRA, with precision above 99%, sensitivity above 99%, and Matthews correlation coefficient above 0.98.},

Although traditional security mechanisms can be implemented at the IT-infrastructure level of such cyber-physical systems, the community has acknowledged that it is imperative to also monitor the process-level activity, as attacks on ICS may very well influence the physical process. In this paper, we present PASAD, a novel stealthy-attack detection mechanism that monitors time series of sensor measurements in real time for structural changes in the process behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations and experiments on data from real systems. Experimental results show that PASAD is capable of detecting not only significant deviations in the process behavior, but also subtle attack-indicating changes, significantly raising the bar for strategic adversaries who may attempt to maintain their malicious manipulation within the noise level.},

We implement and evaluate our anomaly detection technique on a real-world ICS. We pre-compute the process-state parameters using a big data framework for ICS and train the detector leveraging more than 120 GB of historical data from the ICS.

abstract = {Fingerprinting of various physical and logical devices has been proposed for uniquely identifying users or devices of mainstream IT systems such as PCs, laptops, and smart phones. However, the application of such techniques in Industrial Control Systems (ICS) is less explored for reasons such as a lack of direct access to such systems and the cost of faithfully reproducing realistic threat scenarios. This work addresses the feasibility of using fingerprinting techniques in the context of realistic ICS related to water treatment and distribution systems. A model-free sensor fingerprinting scheme (NoiSense) and a model-based sensor fingerprinting scheme (NoisePrint) are proposed. Using extensive experimentation with sensors, it is shown that noise patterns due to microscopic imperfections in hardware manufacturing can uniquely identify sensors with accuracy as high as 97%. The proposed technique can be used to detect physical attacks, such as the replacement of legitimate sensors by faulty or manipulated sensors. For NoisePrint, a combined fingerprint for sensor and process noise is created. The difference (called residual), between expected and observed values, i.e., noise, is used to derive a model of the system. It was found that in steady state the residual vector is a function of process and sensor noise. Data from experiments reveals that a multitude of sensors can be uniquely identified with a minimum accuracy of 90% based on NoisePrint. Also proposed is a novel challenge-response protocol that exposes more powerful cyber-attacks, including replay attacks.},

abstract = {As more and more cyber security incident data ranging from systems logs to vulnerability scan results are collected, manually analyzing these collected data to detect important cyber security events become impossible. Hence, data mining techniques are becoming an essential tool for real-world cyber security applications. For example, a report from Gartner [gartner12] claims that "Information security is becoming a big data analytics problem, where massive amounts of data will be correlated, analyzed and mined for meaningful patterns". Of course, data mining/analytics is a means to an end where the ultimate goal is to provide cyber security analysts with prioritized actionable insights derived from big data. This raises the question, can we directly apply existing techniques to cyber security applications? One of the most important differences between data mining for cyber security and many other data mining applications is the existence of malicious adversaries that continuously adapt their behavior to hide their actions and to make the data mining models ineffective. Unfortunately, traditional data mining techniques are insufficient to handle such adversarial problems directly. The adversaries adapt to the data miner's reactions, and data mining algorithms constructed based on a training dataset degrades quickly. To address these concerns, over the last couple of years new and novel data mining techniques which is more resilient to such adversarial behavior are being developed in machine learning and data mining community. We believe that lessons learned as a part of this research direction would be beneficial for cyber security researchers who are increasingly applying machine learning and data mining techniques in practice.To give an overview of recent developments in adversarial data mining, in this three hour long tutorial, we introduce the foundations, the techniques, and the applications of adversarial data mining to cyber security applications. We first introduce various approaches proposed in the past to defend against active adversaries, such as a minimax approach to minimize the worst case error through a zero-sum game. We then discuss a game theoretic framework to model the sequential actions of the adversary and the data miner, while both parties try to maximize their utilities. We also introduce a modified support vector machine method and a relevance vector machine method to defend against active adversaries. Intrusion detection and malware detection are two important application areas for adversarial data mining models that will be discussed in details during the tutorial. Finally, we discuss some practical guidelines on how to use adversarial data mining ideas in generic cyber security applications and how to leverage existing big data management tools for building data mining algorithms for cyber security.},

Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices share common vulnerabilities with standard IoT devices, which are increasingly exposed to the attackers.

We carry on an analysis of the current state of the security of IIoT technologies. The analysis guides the identification of a set of attack vectors for the examined networked embedded system. We set up the corresponding concrete attack scenarios to gain control of the system actuators and perform some hazardous operations.

abstract = {While attacks on information systems have for most practical purposes binary outcomes (information was manipulated/eavesdropped, or not), attacks manipulating the sensor or control signals of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) can be tuned by the attacker to cause a continuous spectrum in damages. Attackers that want to remain undetected can attempt to hide their manipulation of the system by following closely the expected behavior of the system, while injecting just enough false information at each time step to achieve their goals. In this work, we study if attack-detection can limit the impact of such stealthy attacks. We start with a comprehensive review of related work on attack detection schemes in the security and control systems community. We then show that many of those works use detection schemes that are not limiting the impact of stealthy attacks. We propose a new metric to measure the impact of stealthy attacks and how they relate to our selection on an upper bound on false alarms. We finally show that the impact of such attacks can be mitigated in several cases by the proper combination and configuration of detection schemes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms through simulations and experiments using real ICS testbeds and real ICS systems.},

abstract = {The recent evolution of edge computing favored the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) growth, opening dangerous surfaces of vulnerabilities. In this distributed sensor system scenario, due to the insecure interactions between Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) networks, cyber-physical threats could lead to destructive consequences for environments and population safety. To deal with industrial cyber-physical security, modern anomaly detection systems implement innovative Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Unfortunately, current solutions still fail to provide an effective prevention to complex industrial threats.In this paper, we present KingFisher, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) framework based on ML. KingFisher is, to the best of our knowledge, the first solution that looks independently at IT and OT traffic, but also from sensors deployed to capture side-channel physical processes data (e.g., vibrations, background noise). Thanks to this feature, KingFisher can detect attacks that other systems would ignore. As our tests report, the correlation of inferred physical processes status with OT-network and IT-network data can give insights into suspicious and anomalous activities targeting industrial networks. For our framework, we use the Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), an unsupervised neural network model, to categorize data without a priori knowledge of the dataset. We evaluate the detection capabilities and performances of KingFisher in a proof of concept simulated industrial scenario under cyber-physical attacks. Our preliminary results show that KingFisher identifies attacks on both network and physical layers.},

In such cases, learning algorithms may have to cope with manipulated data aimed at hampering decision making. Although some previous work addressed the issue of handling malicious data in the context of supervised learning, very little is known about the behavior of anomaly detection methods in such scenarios. In this contribution, we analyze the performance of a particular method--online centroid anomaly detection--in the presence of adversarial noise. Our analysis addresses the following security-related issues: formalization of learning and attack processes, derivation of an optimal attack, and analysis of attack efficiency and limitations. We derive bounds on the effectiveness of a poisoning attack against centroid anomaly detection under different conditions: attacker's full or limited control over the traffic and bounded false positive rate. Our bounds show that whereas a poisoning attack can be effectively staged in the unconstrained case, it can be made arbitrarily difficult (a strict upper bound on the attacker's gain) if external constraints are properly used. Our experimental evaluation, carried out on real traces of HTTP and exploit traffic, confirms the tightness of our theoretical bounds and the practicality of our protection mechanisms.},

abstract = {Due to technological advances, it has been a common practice for quite some time to use embedded computers for the monitoring and control of physical processes/plants. These are essentially networked computer-based systems consisting of application-specific control-processing systems, actuators, sensors etc., used for digitally controlling physical systems (often in a federated manner) within a defined geographical location such as power plants, chemical plants etc. Different terminologies like distributed control systems (DCS), cyber-physical systems (CPS), supervisory control and data acquisition systems(SCADA) etc., are used to denoting similar usage. Technology has further made it possible to federate/ integrate heterogeneous (even built by different manufacturers) systems. While such capabilities have provided the needed flexibility and user convenience, it has also created challenges for system designers not only from the correctness point of view but also from the point of view of security and protection of the underlying physical plants. With the arrival of complex malwares, it has become very challenging to secure network and information systems from intruders and protect the systems from attackers. Recently, complex malwares like Stuxnet, Flame etc., have specifically targeted SCADA of public infrastructures like power grids/plants, and thus, bringing to the forefront the challenges in securing and protecting SCADA. The above mentioned malwares are horrendously complex and hence, need a wholesome approach for detection and protection. In these scenarios, apart from the classical IT security, there is a need to look at other plausible new attacks considering the domain of the physical systems in conjunction with the capabilities of the embedded computers, and arrive at methods of protection and risk evaluation.In this paper, we shall describe an algorithmic data-intensive approach (referred to as Bigdata approach) for protecting and securing SCADA from malware attacks. The approach is based on using the data used by control-system designers for making the system robust, and then reducing the security and protection problem of control systems or SCADA, in general, to the problem of monitoring distributed streaming data. We further show that the method is algorithmically scalable and argue that such algorithmic Bigdata approaches enable securing and protecting of IT controlled public infrastructures.},

We perform experiments with two state-of-the-art SCAs (Flush+Reload and Flush+Flush) to demonstrate the detection capability and effectiveness of NIGHTs-WATCH. we provide experimental evaluation using realistic system load conditions and analyze results on detection accuracy, speed, system-wide performance overhead and confusion matrix for used models. Our results show detection accuracy of 99.51%, 99.50% and 99.44% for F+R attack in case of no, average and full load conditions, respectively, with performance overhead of &lt; 2% at the highest detection speed, i.e., within 1% completion of a single RSA encryption round. In case of Flush+Flush, our results show 99.97%, 98.74% and 95.20% detection accuracy for no load, average load and full load conditions, respectively, with performance overhead of &lt; 2% at the highest detection speed, i.e., within 12.5% completion of 400 AES encryption rounds needed to complete the attack. NIGHTs-WATCH shows considerably high detection efficiency under variable system load conditions.},

abstract = {Much research effort has recently been devoted to securing Industrial Control Systems (ICS) in response to the increasing number of adverse incidents targeting nation-wide critical infrastructures. Leveraging the static and regular nature of the behavior of control systems, various data-driven methods that monitor the process-level network have been proposed as a defensive measure. Although these methods have been evaluated through offline analysis of ICS-related datasets, in absence of documented live experiments in real environments, a complete and global understanding of the applicability and efficiency of process-level monitoring is still lacking.In this work, we describe our experience of running a fully fledged intrusion detection system in an operational paper factory for 75 days. We discuss the nuts and bolts of running such systems in real environments and underline several practical challenges in meeting ICS-specific requirements. This work essentially aims at bridging the gap between ICS intrusion detection research and practice, and empirically validating the increasingly adopted data-driven approach to process-level monitoring.},

In this paper, we proposed a technique called Process Skew that uses the small deviations in the ICS process (herein called as a process fingerprint) for anomaly detection. The process fingerprint appears as noise in sensor measurements due to the process fluctuations. Such a fingerprint is unique to a process due to the intrinsic operational constraints of the physical process. We validated the proposed scheme using the data from a real-world water treatment testbed. Our results show that we can effectively identify a process based on its fingerprint, and detect process anomaly with a very low false-positive rate.},

abstract = {The success of classification learning has led to numerous attempts to apply it in adversarial settings such as spam and malware detection. The core challenge in this class of applications is that adversaries are not static, but make a deliberate effort to evade the classifiers. We investigate both the problem of modeling the objectives of such adversaries, as well as the algorithmic problem of accounting for rational, objective-driven adversaries. We first present a general approach based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) with constraint generation. This approach is the first to compute an optimal solution to adversarial loss minimization for two general classes of adversarial evasion models in the context of binary feature spaces. To further improve scalability and significantly generalize the scope of the MILP-based method, we propose a principled iterative retraining framework, which can be used with arbitrary classifiers and essentially arbitrary attack models. We show that the retraining approach, when it converges, minimizes an upper bound on adversarial loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the mixed-integer programming approach significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art adversarial learning alternatives. Moreover, the retraining framework performs nearly as well, but scales significantly better. Finally, we show that our approach is robust to misspecifications of the adversarial model.},

abstract = {Robotic vehicles (RV) are increasing in adoption in many industrial sectors. RVs use auto-pilot software for perception and navigation and rely on sensors and actuators for operating autonomously in the physical world. Control algorithms have been used in RVs to minimize the effects of noisy sensors, prevent faulty actuator output, and, recently, to detect attacks against RVs. In this article, we demonstrate the vulnerabilities in control-based intrusion detection techniques and propose three kinds of stealthy attacks that evade detection and disrupt RV missions. We also propose automated algorithms for performing the attacks without requiring the attacker to expend significant effort or to know specific details of the RV, thus making the attacks applicable to a wide range of RVs. We demonstrate the attacks on eight RV systems including three real vehicles in the presence of an Intrusion Detection System using control-based techniques to monitor RV’s runtime behavior and detect attacks. We find that the control-based techniques are incapable of detecting our stealthy attacks and that the attacks can have significant adverse impact on the RV’s mission (e.g., deviate it significantly from its target, or cause it to crash).},

However, while such systems prove invaluable to security personnel, researchers have observed that data subject to inspection by behavioral analysis can be perturbed in order to evade detection.We investigated the use of adversarial techniques for adapting the communication patterns between botnet malware and control unit in order to evaluate the robustness of an existing Network Behavioral Analysis solution. We implemented a packet parser that let us extract and edit certain properties of network flows and automated an approach for conducting a grey-box testing scheme of Stratosphere Linux IPS. As part of our implementation, we provided several techniques for providing perturbation to network flow parameters, including a Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation method, which was able to produce sufficiently perturbed network flow patterns while adhering to an underlying objective function.Our results showed that network flow parameters could indeed be perturbed to ultimately enable evasion of intrusion detection based on the detection models that were used with the Intrusion Detection System. Additionally, we demonstrated that it was possible to combine evading detection with techniques for optimization problems that aimed to minimize the magnitude of perturbation to network flows, effectively enabling adaptive network flow behavior.},

abstract = {Current intrusion detection systems (IDS) for industrial control systems (ICS) mostly involve the retrofitting of conventional network IDSs, such as SNORT. Such an approach is prone to missing highly targeted and specific attacks against ICS. Where ICS-specific approaches exist, they often rely on passive network monitoring techniques, offering a low cost solution, and avoiding any computational overhead arising from actively polling ICS devices. However, the use of passive approaches alone could fail in the detection of attacks that alter the behaviour of ICS devices (as was the case in Stuxnet). Where active solutions exist, they can be resource-intensive, posing the risk of overloading legacy devices which are commonplace in ICSs. In this paper we aim to overcome these challenges through the combination of a passive network monitoring approach, and selective active monitoring based on attack vectors specific to an ICS context. We present the implementation of our IDS, SENAMI, for use with Siemens S7 devices. We evaluate the effectiveness of SENAMI in a comprehensive testbed environment, demonstrating validity of the proposed approach through the detection of purely passive attacks at a rate of 99%, and active value tampering attacks at a rate of 81-93%. Crucially, we reach recall values greater than 0.96, indicating few attack scenarios generating false negatives.},

Emerging categories of program attacks, e.g., non-control data attacks and data-oriented programming, are able to comply with normal trace patterns at local views. This article points out the deficiency of existing program anomaly detection models against new attacks and presents long-span behavior anomaly detection (LAD), a model based on mildly context-sensitive grammar verification. The key feature of LAD is its reasoning of correlations among arbitrary events that occurred in long program traces. It extends existing correlation analysis between events at a stack snapshot, e.g., paired call and ret, to correlation analysis among events that historically occurred during the execution. The proposed method leverages specialized machine learning techniques to probe normal program behavior boundaries in vast high-dimensional detection space. Its two-stage modeling/detection design analyzes event correlation at both binary and quantitative levels. Our prototype successfully detects all reproduced real-world attacks against sshd, libpcre, and sendmail. The detection procedure incurs 0.1 ms to 1.3 ms overhead to profile and analyze a single behavior instance that consists of tens of thousands of function call or system call events.},

abstract = {Machine learning models have been widely used in security applications. However, it is well-known that adversaries can adapt their attacks to evade detection. There has been some work on making machine learning models more robust to such attacks. However, one simple but promising approach called randomization is under-explored. In addition, most existing works focus on models with differentiable error functions while tree-based models do not have such error functions but are quite popular because they are easy to interpret. This paper proposes a novel randomization-based approach to improve robustness of tree-based models against evasion attacks. The proposed approach incorporates randomization into both model training time and model application time (meaning when the model is used to detect attacks). We also apply this approach to random forest, an existing ML method which already has incorporated randomness at training time but still often fails to generate robust models. We proposed a novel weighted-random-forest method to generate more robust models and a clustering method to add randomness at model application time. Experiments on intrusion detection and spam filtering data show that our approach further improves robustness of random-forest method.},

In this research study, we are conducting a vulnerability assessment of the malware classification model by injecting the datasets with an adversarial example to degrade the quality of classification obtained currently by a trained model. The objective is to find the security gaps that are exploitable in the model. The vulnerability assessment is done by introducing the malware classification model to an AML environment using the Black-Box attack. The simulation provided an insight into the inputs injected into the classifiers and proves the inherent security vulnerability exists in the classification model.},

abstract = {Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are increasingly adopting machine learning (ML)-based approaches to detect threats in computer networks due to their ability to learn underlying threat patterns/features. However, ML-based models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, attacks wherein slight perturbations of the input features, cause misclassifications. We propose a method that uses active learning and generative adversarial networks to evaluate the threat of adversarial attacks on ML-based IDS. Existing adversarial attack methods require a large amount of training data or assume knowledge of the IDS model itself (e.g., loss function), which may not be possible in real-world settings. Our method overcomes these limitations by demonstrating the ability to compromise an IDS using limited training data and assuming no prior knowledge of the IDS model other than its binary classification (i.e., benign or malicious). Experimental results demonstrate the ability of our proposed model to achieve a 98.86% success rate in bypassing the IDS model using only 25 labeled data points during model training. The knowledge gained by compromising the ML-based IDS, can be integrated into the IDS in order to enhance its robustness against similar ML-based adversarial attacks.},

abstract = {The rapid evolution of the emerging communication landscape prompted the rise of never seen before threats, in this way encouraging the development of more effective Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) able to recognize outlying behaviors. But despite the theoretical effectiveness of the existing state-of-the-art, the in-depth review of the bibliography suggests the need for their constant adaptation to the changes in their operational environment and preventing being evaded by mimicry methods. The latest threats attempt to hide the malicious actions in a tangle of statistical features that simulate the normal use of the protected network, so they acquire a greater chance of avoiding the defensive actuators. In order to contribute to their mitigation, this paper introduces a novel intrusion detection strategy resistant against mimicry. The proposal constructs models of the network usage and from them, analyzes the binary contents of the traffic payload looking for outlying patterns that may evidence malicious contents. In contrast to most previous solutions, our research overcomes the traditional strengthening via randomization, by taking advantage of scoring the suspicious packet similarity between legitimate and previously built adversarial models. Its effectiveness was evaluated on the public datasets DARPA'99 and UCM 2011, where its ability to recognize attacks obfuscated by imitation was proven.},

abstract = {Conventional cyber defenses typically respond to detected attacks by rejecting them as quickly and decisively as possible; but aborted attacks are missed learning opportunities for intrusion detection. A method of reimagining cyber attacks as free sources of live training data for machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDSes) is proposed and evaluated. Rather than aborting attacks against legitimate services, adversarial interactions are selectively prolonged to maximize the defender's harvest of useful threat intelligence. Enhancing web services with deceptive attack-responses in this way is shown to be a powerful and practical strategy for improved detection, addressing several perennial challenges for machine learning-based IDS in the literature, including scarcity of training data, the high labeling burden for (semi-)supervised learning, encryption opacity, and concept differences between honeypot attacks and those against genuine services. By reconceptualizing software security patches as feature extraction engines, the approach conscripts attackers as free penetration testers, and coordinates multiple levels of the software stack to achieve fast, automatic, and accurate labeling of live web data streams.Prototype implementations are showcased for two feature set models to extract security-relevant network- and system-level features from servers hosting enterprise-grade web applications. The evaluation demonstrates that the extracted data can be fed back into a network-level IDS for exceptionally accurate, yet lightweight attack detection.},

abstract = {The process of identifying the true anomalies from a given set of data instances is known as anomaly detection. It has been applied to address a diverse set of problems in multiple application domains including cybersecurity. Deep learning has recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on key anomaly detection applications, such as intrusion detection, Denial of Service (DoS) attack detection, security log analysis, and malware detection. Despite the great successes achieved by neural network architectures, models with very low test error have been shown to be consistently vulnerable to small, adversarially chosen perturbations of the input. The existence of evasion attacks during the test phase of machine learning algorithms represents a significant challenge to both their deployment and understanding.Recent approaches in the literature have focused on three different areas: (a) generating adversarial examples in supervised machine learning in multiple domains; (b) countering the attacks with various defenses; (c) theoretical guarantees on the robustness of machine learning models by understanding their security properties. However, they have not covered, from the perspective of the anomaly detection task in a black box setting. The exploration of black box attack strategies, which reduce the number of queries for finding adversarial examples with high probability, is an important problem.In this paper, we study the security of black box deep anomaly detectors with a realistic threat model. We propose a novel black box attack in query constraint settings. First, we run manifold approximation on samples collected at attacker end for query reduction and understanding various thresholds set by underlying anomaly detector, and use spherical adversarial subspaces to generate attack samples. This method is well suited for attacking anomaly detectors where decision boundaries of nominal and abnormal classes are not very well defined and decision process is done with a set of thresholds on anomaly scores. We validate our attack on state-of-the-art deep anomaly detectors and show that the attacker goal is achieved under constraint settings. Our evaluation of the proposed approach shows promising results and demonstrates that our strategy can be successfully used against other anomaly detectors.},

abstract = {The central task of a Security Incident and Event Manager (SIEM) or Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) is to detect security incidents on the basis of tens of thousands of event types coming from many kinds of security products. We present Smoke Detector, which processes trillions of security events with the Random Walk with Restart (RWR) algorithm, inferring high order relationships between known security incidents and imperfect secondary security events (smoke) to find undiscovered security incidents (fire). By finding previously undetected incidents, Smoke Detector's RWR algorithm is able to increase the MSSP's critical incident count by 19% with a 1.3% FP rate.Perhaps equally importantly, our approach offers significant benefits beyond increased incident detection: (1) It provides a robust approach for leveraging Big Data sensor nets to increase adversarial resistance of protected networks; (2) Our event-scoring techniques enable efficient discovery of primary indicators of compromise; (3) Our confidence scores provide intuition and tuning capabilities for Smoke Detector's discovered security incidents, aiding incident display and response.},

abstract = {The neural network has attracted a large number of researchers in the field of network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) due to its powerful performance. However, most attention was paid to the improvement of the performance of the target system while few to the security issues of the neural network itself. The online learning network uses the constant network traffic as the training data to achieve lower memory usage, better adaptation to the environment over time, and an infinite amount of training data. Due to the existence of network attacks specifically designed for neural networks such as poison attacks and evasion attacks, as well as the existence of the false positives of the model itself, suspicious traffic will be inevitably put into training, resulting in performance drops or even collapse. Furthermore, autoencoder based anomaly detection needs pure normal data for train, which is more dangerous in the situation mentioned above. This article proposes a novel idea to improve the training process of autoencoder based NIDS under online learning. Since the training data in online learning can be regarded as infinite, we can randomly throw away a part of the data that is about to enter training. Experiments were implemented by the DAE-based anomaly detection algorithm and KDD99 datasets. It can be known that performance deduction can be significantly alleviated by tuning the leakage ratio and accuracy decrease can be suppressed effectively.},

PIDPS is intended to support network security personnel in optimizing the placement and configuration of malware filtering and monitoring devices within Network Service Providers’ (NSP) infrastructure, and enterprise communication networks. PIDPS meshes innovative and state-of-the-art mechanisms borrowed from the domains of graph theory, epidemic modeling, and network simulation. Scalable network exploitation models enable to define the communication patterns induced by network users (thereby establishing a virtual overlay network), and parallel attack models enable a PIDPS user to define various interdependent network attacks such as: Internet worms, Trojans horses, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, and others. PIDPS incorporates a set of deployment strategies (employing graph-theoretic centrality measures) in order to facilitate intelligent placement of filtering and monitoring devices; as well as a dedicated network simulator in order to evaluate the various deployments. Experiments with PIDPS indicate that incorporating knowledge on the overlay network (network exploitation patterns) into the placement and configuration of malware filtering and monitoring devices substantially improves the effectiveness of intrusion detection and prevention systems in NSP and enterprise networks.},

abstract = {Adversarial evasion attacks challenge the integrity of machine learning models by creating out-of-distribution samples that are consistently misclassified by these models. While a variety of detection and mitigation approaches have been proposed, they are typically defeated by designing even more sophisticated attacks. One of the most promising group of such approaches is based on creating multiple diversified machine learning models and leveraging their ensemble properties for detection and mitigation of adversarial attacks in a dynamic "moving target'' fashion. However, an efficient implementation of such approaches imposes heavy computation cost for designing and enforcing diversity of multiple classifiers and then training a significant number of them. This paper proposes a scalable modification of dynamic ensemble approach that provides (i) a combinatorial boosting of the number of diversified classifiers which provides an exponentially expanded scope of reliable decisions for dynamic "moving target'' defense, and (ii) robust methods for fusion of ensemble decisions of the resulting classifiers and their combinations towards enhanced confidence in classification decisions in both benign and adversarial scenarios. Two versions of the approach were implemented and tested for machine learning models operating in two different modalities (network intrusion detection and color image classification). Both show significant increase of resiliency against adversarial evasion attacks with moderate to low impact on benign performance of defended machine learning model. For network modality, different versions of approach improved the benign accuracy from 98% to 100% while raising the adversarial accuracy from 0% to 90%-95%; for image modality, benign accuracy remained at the same level of 90% while the adversarial accuracy improved from 0% to about 85%.},

abstract = {Smart grid deployment initiatives have been witnessed in recent years. Smart grids provide bidirectional communication between meters and head-end systems through Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). Recent studies highlight the threats targeting AMI. Despite the need for tailored Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for smart grids, very limited progress has been made in this area. Unlike traditional networks, smart grids have their own unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, that restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. We show that smart grids exhibit deterministic and predictable behavior that can be accurately modeled to detect intrusion. However, it can also be leveraged by the attackers to launch evasion attacks. To this end, in this article, we present a robust mutation-based intrusion detection system that makes the behavior unpredictable for the attacker while keeping it deterministic for the system. We model the AMI behavior using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the invariant specifications generated from the AMI behavior and mutable configuration. Event logs are modeled using fourth-order Markov chain and specifications are written in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). To counter evasion and mimicry attacks, we propose a configuration randomization module. The approach provides robustness against evasion and mimicry attacks; however, we discuss that it still can be evaded to a certain extent. We validate our approach on a real-world dataset of thousands of meters collected at the AMI of a leading utility provider.},

abstract = {Many learning tasks such as spam filtering and credit card fraud detection face an active adversary that tries to avoid detection. For learning problems that deal with an active adversary, it is important to model the adversary's attack strategy and develop robust learning models to mitigate the attack. These are the two objectives of this paper. We consider two attack models: a free-range attack model that permits arbitrary data corruption and a restrained attack model that anticipates more realistic attacks that a reasonable adversary would devise under penalties. We then develop optimal SVM learning strategies against the two attack models. The learning algorithms minimize the hinge loss while assuming the adversary is modifying data to maximize the loss. Experiments are performed on both artificial and real data sets. We demonstrate that optimal solutions may be overly pessimistic when the actual attacks are much weaker than expected. More important, we demonstrate that it is possible to develop a much more resilient SVM learning model while making loose assumptions on the data corruption models. When derived under the restrained attack model, our optimal SVM learning strategy provides more robust overall performance under a wide range of attack parameters.},

abstract = {Intrusion detection systems are a commonly deployed defense that examines network traffic, host operations, or both to detect attacks. However, more attacks bypass IDS defenses each year, and with the sophistication of attacks increasing as well, we must examine new perspectives for intrusion detection. Current intrusion detection systems focus on known attacks and/or vulnerabilities, limiting their ability to identify new attacks, and lack the visibility into all system components necessary to confirm attacks accurately, particularly programs. To change the landscape of intrusion detection, we propose that future IDSs track how attacks evolve across system layers by adapting the concept of attack graphs. Attack graphs were proposed to study how multi-stage attacks could be launched by exploiting known vulnerabilities. Instead of constructing attacks reactively, we propose to apply attack graphs proactively to detect sequences of events that fulfill the requirements for vulnerability exploitation. Using this insight, we examine how to generate modular attack graphs automatically that relate adversary accessibility for each component, called its attack surface, to flaws that provide adversaries with permissions that create threats, called attack states, and exploit operations from those threats, called attack actions. We evaluate the proposed approach by applying it to two case studies: (1) attacks on file retrieval, such as TOCTTOU attacks, and (2) attacks propagated among processes, such as attacks on Shell-shock vulnerabilities. In these case studies, we demonstrate how to leverage existing tools to compute attack graphs automatically and assess the effectiveness of these tools for building complete attack graphs. While we identify some research areas, we also find several reasons why attack graphs can provide a valuable foundation for improving future intrusion detection systems.},

abstract = {Robotic vehicles (RVs) are cyber-physical systems that operate in the physical world under the control of software functions. They are increasing in adoption in many industrial sectors. RVs rely on sensors and actuators for system operations and navigation. Control algorithm based estimation techniques have been used in RVs to minimize the effects of noisy sensors, prevent faulty actuator output, and recently, in detecting attacks against RVs. In this paper, we propose three kinds of attacks to evade the control-based detection techniques and cause RVs to malfunction. We also propose automated algorithms for performing the attacks without requiring the attacker to expend significant effort or know specific details of the RV, making the attacks applicable to a wide range of RVs. We demonstrate these attacks on ArduPilot simulators and two real RVs (a drone and a rover) in the presence of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using control estimation models to monitor the runtime behavior of the system. We find that the control models are incapable of detecting our stealthy attacks, and that the attacks can have significant adverse impact on the RV's mission (e.g., cause the RV to crash or deviate from its target significantly).},

abstract = {Neural networks are increasingly important in the development of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), as they have the potential to achieve high detection accuracy while requiring limited feature engineering. Deep learning-based detectors can be however vulnerable to adversarial examples, by which attackers that may be oblivious to the precise mechanics of the targeted NIDS add subtle perturbations to malicious traffic features, with the aim of evading detection and disrupting critical systems in a cost-effective manner. Defending against such adversarial attacks is therefore of high importance, but requires to address daunting challenges.In this paper, we introduce Tiki-Taka, a general framework for (i) assessing the robustness of state-of-the-art deep learning-based NIDS against adversarial manipulations, and which (ii) incorporates our proposed defense mechanisms to increase the NIDS' resistance to attacks employing such evasion techniques. Specifically, we select five different cutting-edge adversarial attack mechanisms to subvert three popular malicious traffic detectors that employ neural networks. We experiment with a publicly available dataset and consider both one-to-all and one-to-one classification scenarios, i.e., discriminating illicit vs benign traffic and respectively identifying specific types of anomalous traffic among many observed. The results obtained reveal that, under realistic constraints, attackers can evade NIDS with up to 35.7% success rates, by only altering time-based features of the traffic generated. To counteract these weaknesses, we propose three defense mechanisms, namely: model voting ensembling, ensembling adversarial training, and query detection. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to propose defenses against adversarial attacks targeting NIDS. We demonstrate that when employing the proposed methods, intrusion detection rates can be improved to nearly 100% against most types of malicious traffic, and attacks with potentially catastrophic consequences (e.g., botnet) can be thwarted. This confirms the effectiveness of our solutions and makes the case for their adoption when designing robust and reliable deep anomaly detectors.},

abstract = {MAC-layer spoofing, also known as identity spoofing, is recognized as a serious problem in many practical wireless systems. IoT systems are particularly vulnerable to this type of attack, as IoT devices (due to their various limitations) are often incapable of deploying advanced MAC-layer spoofing prevention and detection techniques - such as cryptographic authentication. Signal-level device fingerprinting is an approach to identity spoofing detection that is highly suitable for sensor-based IoT networks, but can be also utilized in many other types of wireless system. Unfortunately, the previous research works on signal-level device fingerprinting have been based on rather simplistic assumptions about both - the adversary's behavior as well as the operation of the defense system. The goal of our work was to examine the effectiveness of a novel system that combines signal-level device fingerprinting with the principles of Randomized Moving Target Defense (RMTD) when dealing with a very advanced adversary. The obtained results show that our RMTD-enhanced signal-level device fingerprinting technique exhibits far superior defense performance over the non-RMTD techniques previously discussed in the literature, and as such could be of great value for practical wireless systems subjected to identity spoofing attacks.},

abstract = {In recent years, machine learning algorithms, and more specifically deep learning algorithms, have been widely used in many fields, including cyber security. However, machine learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and this limits the application of machine learning, especially in non-stationary, adversarial environments, such as the cyber security domain, where actual adversaries (e.g., malware developers) exist. This article comprehensively summarizes the latest research on adversarial attacks against security solutions based on machine learning techniques and illuminates the risks they pose. First, the adversarial attack methods are characterized based on their stage of occurrence, and the attacker’ s goals and capabilities. Then, we categorize the applications of adversarial attack and defense methods in the cyber security domain. Finally, we highlight some characteristics identified in recent research and discuss the impact of recent advancements in other adversarial learning domains on future research directions in the cyber security domain. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to discuss the unique challenges of implementing end-to-end adversarial attacks in the cyber security domain, map them in a unified taxonomy, and use the taxonomy to highlight future research directions.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) advocating a centralized view of networks, efficient and reliable Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) defenses are necessary to protect the centralized SDN controller. In this work, we explore the robustness of DL-based DDoS defenses in SDN against adversarial learning attacks. First, we investigate generic off-the-shelf adversarial attacks to test the robustness of DDoS defenses in SDN. Then, we propose Flow-Merge for realistic adversarial flows while achieving a high evasion rate. The evaluation shows that the proposed Flow-Merge is able to force the DL-based DDoS defenses to misclassify 100% of benign flows as malicious.},

abstract = {The dependency of our society on networked computers has become frightening: In the economy, all-digital networks have turned from facilitators to drivers; as cyber-physical systems are coming of age, computer networks are now becoming the central nervous systems of our physical world—even of highly critical infrastructures such as the power grid. At the same time, the 24/7 availability and correct functioning of networked computers has become much more threatened: The number of sophisticated and highly tailored attacks on IT systems has significantly increased. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a key component of the corresponding defense measures; they have been extensively studied and utilized in the past. Since conventional IDSs are not scalable to big company networks and beyond, nor to massively parallel attacks, Collaborative IDSs (CIDSs) have emerged. They consist of several monitoring components that collect and exchange data. Depending on the specific CIDS architecture, central or distributed analysis components mine the gathered data to identify attacks. Resulting alerts are correlated among multiple monitors in order to create a holistic view of the network monitored. This article first determines relevant requirements for CIDSs; it then differentiates distinct building blocks as a basis for introducing a CIDS design space and for discussing it with respect to requirements. Based on this design space, attacks that evade CIDSs and attacks on the availability of the CIDSs themselves are discussed. The entire framework of requirements, building blocks, and attacks as introduced is then used for a comprehensive analysis of the state of the art in collaborative intrusion detection, including a detailed survey and comparison of specific CIDS approaches.},

abstract = {Detection methods based on n-gram models have been widely studied for the identification of attacks and malicious software. These methods usually build on one of two learning schemes: anomaly detection, where a model of normality is constructed from n-grams, or classification, where a discrimination between benign and malicious n-grams is learned. Although successful in many security domains, previous work falls short of explaining why a particular scheme is used and more importantly what renders one favorable over the other for a given type of data. In this paper we provide a close look on n-gram models for intrusion detection. We specifically study anomaly detection and classification using n-grams and develop criteria for data being used in one or the other scheme. Furthermore, we apply these criteria in the scope of web intrusion detection and empirically validate their effectiveness with different learning-based detection methods for client-side and service-side attacks.},
