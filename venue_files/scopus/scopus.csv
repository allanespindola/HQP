These examples have achieved a great deal of success in several domains such as image recognition, speech recognition and spam detection. In this paper, we study the nature of the adversarial problem in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). We focus on the attack perspective, which includes techniques to generate adversarial examples capable of evading a variety of machine learning models. More specifically, we explore the use of evolutionary computation (particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm) and deep learning (generative adversarial networks) as tools for adversarial example generation. To assess the performance of these algorithms in evading a NIDS, we apply them to two publicly available data sets, namely the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15, and we contrast them to a baseline perturbation method: Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that our adversarial example generation techniques cause high misclassification rates in eleven different machine learning models, along with a voting classifier. Our work highlights the vulnerability of machine learning based NIDS in the face of adversarial perturbation. © 2021","Adversarial machine learning; Deep learning; Evolutionary computation; Monte Carlo simulation; Network Intrusion Detection Systems","Computer crime; Deep learning; Genetic algorithms; Image recognition; Intelligent systems; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Perturbation techniques; Speech recognition; Adversarial machine learning; Deep learning; In networks; Machine learning models; Machine learning systems; Machine-learning; Monte Carlo's simulation; Network intrusion detection systems; Particle swarm genetic algorithms; Spam detection; Monte Carlo methods","Akhtar, N., Mian, A., Threat of adversarial attacks on deep learning in computer vision: A survey (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 14410-14430; Alzantot, M., Sharma, Y., Chakraborty, S., Zhang, H., Hsieh, C.-J., Srivastava, M.B., Genattack: Practical black-box attacks with gradient-free optimization (2019) Proceedings of the genetic and evolutionary computation conference, pp. 1111-1119. , Association for Computing Machinery New York, NY, USA; Andresini, G., Appice, A., De Rose, L., Malerba, D., GAN augmentation to deal with imbalance in imaging-based intrusion detection (2021) Future Generation Computer Systems, 123, pp. 108-127; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., The security of machine learning (2010) Machine Learning, 81 (2), pp. 121-148; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure?

SDN provides resources for improving network control and management by separating control and data plane, and the logical control is centralized in a controller. However, the centralized control logic can be an ideal target for malicious attacks, mainly Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Recently, Deep Learning has become a powerful technique applied in cybersecurity, and many Network Intrusion Detection (NIDS) have been proposed in recent researches. Some studies have indicated that deep neural networks are sensitive in detecting adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks are instances with certain perturbations that cause deep neural networks to misclassify. In this paper, we proposed a detection and defense system based on Adversarial training in SDN, which uses Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework for detecting DDoS attacks and applies adversarial training to make the system less sensitive to adversarial attacks. The proposed system includes well-defined modules that enable continuous traffic monitoring using IP flow analysis, enabling the anomaly detection system to act in near-real-time. We conducted the experiments on two distinct scenarios, with emulated data and the public dataset CICDDoS 2019. Experimental results demonstrated that the system efficiently detected up-to-date common types of DDoS attacks compared to other approaches. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Adversarial attacks; DDoS; Deep Learning; GAN; SDN","Anomaly detection; Application programs; Deep neural networks; Information management; Intrusion detection; Network security; Adversarial attack; Deep learning; Denial-of-services attack; Distributed denial of service; Emerging architectures; Generative adversarial network; Learning approach; Networking environment; Neural-networks; Software-defined networkings; Denial-of-service attack","Zhang, X., Cui, L., Wei, K., Tso, F.P., Ji, Y., Jia, W., A survey on stateful data plane in software defined networks (2020) Comput.

The WSN used in military applications need more security and hence the deployment of trustworthy nodes and links in WSN provides more secure data transmission in Decentralized Military Sensor Networks (DMSNs). Moreover, the DMSNs work with different set of significance constraints including higher security requirements. The design of DMSNs targets surveillance tasks, intruder tracking tasks, army resource maintenance tasks and communication security requirements. Therefore, building a secure and dynamic DMSN against multiple threats is a challenging task. In addition, security principles developed for DMSN cause excessive energy consumption. Moreover, DMSN has completely open distributed architecture without having any base stations. Under this situation, the need for effective and secured data communication can be achieved with the help of a secure routing protocol. Block chains are generally used for making secure financial transactions. However, the routing protocols used in DMSN can support autonomous routing transactions from one node to other node. In this situation, block chain enabled routing procedures can ensure the trustworthiness of any data that is forwarded through different sensor nodes. Hence, a new Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based Block Chain enabled secured Routing Protocol (GBCRP) is proposed in this paper which authenticates and validates the ongoing routing procedures of DMSN. Moreover, a new intrusion detection system is also proposed in this work using GAN which is deployed in the nodes of the DMSN for enhancing the security of communication. Since block chain based routing protocols do not provide security, the GBCRP works for creating volatile block chains using decentralized authentication principles and effective intrusion detection. The proposed system uses a Fully Decentralized Generative Adversarial Network (FDGAN) for monitoring the secure routing transactions by the development of an intrusion detection system. The results obtained from this work show that the proposed GBCRP providing better secured routing compared to the existing systems with respect to security, energy consumption and routing metrics. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Authentication;

When associating with Software-Defined Networks (SDN), the deployment of IDSs can leverage the centralized control plane in SDN to support for large-scale network monitoring. However, machine learning-based IDSs themselves can be attacked and tricked by adversarial examples with additional perturbation from the original ones. It is vital to provide supplementary unknown traffic to evaluate and improve the resilience of IDS against variants of cyberattacks. Thus, this work explores the method of generating adversarial attack samples by Generative Adversarial Model (GAN) to deceive IDS. We propose DIGFuPAS, a framework can create attack samples which can bypass machine learning-based IDSs in SDN with the black-box manner. In this framework, instead of Vanilla GAN, we use Wassertein GAN (WGAN) to improve the ability of GAN convergence training. In addition, the strategy of preserving functional features of attack traffic is applied to maintain the operational aspect of adversarial attacks. Through our implementation and experiments on NSL-KDD and CICIDS2018 dataset, the decreased detection rate of black-box IDSs on adversarial attacks demonstrates that our proposed framework can make IDSs in SDN-enabled networks misclassify on GAN-based synthetic attacks. Also, we utilize DIGFuPAS as a tool for evaluating and improving the robustness of IDS by repetitively retraining classifiers from crafted network traffic flow. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Adversarial attacks; GAN; IDS; Intrusion detection; Network anomaly detection; SDN","Anomaly detection; Machine learning; Network security; Adversarial attack; Black boxes; Domain machines; GAN; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion-Detection; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Network anomaly detection; Software-defined networks; Intrusion detection","Aydeger, A., Saputro, N., Akkaya, K., A moving target defense and network forensics framework for ISP networks using SDN and NFV (2019) Future Gen.

This paper illustrates a deep learning methodology for the binary classification of the network traffic. The basic idea is to represent network flows as 2D images and use this imagery representation of the network traffic to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The GAN is trained to produce new images of unforeseen network attacks by augmenting the training data used to learn a CNN-based intrusion detection model. The advantage is that the 2D data mapping technique used builds images of the network flows, which allow us to take advantage of deep learning architectures with convolution layers. In addition, the GAN-based data augmentation allows us to deal with the possible imbalance of malicious traffic that is commonly rarer than the normal traffic in the network traffic. Specifically, it is used to simulate unforeseen attacks to train a robust intrusion detection model. The proposed methodology leads to better predictive accuracy when compared to competitive intrusion detection architectures on four benchmark datasets. © 2021","Data augmentation; Deep learning; Image encoding; Intrusion detection","Computer crime; Convolution; Deep learning; Network architecture; Network security; Neural networks; Adversarial networks; Convolutional neural network; Data augmentation; Deep learning; Image encoding; Intrusion detection models; Intrusion-Detection; Network augmentation; Network traffic; Networks flows; Intrusion detection","Jang-Jaccard, J., Nepal, S., A survey of emerging threats in cybersecurity (2014) J.

The abnormal behavior clues are few because it appears rarely. To detect each abnormal behavior, the problem is transformed into a multi-class classification task where it lies into data imbalance representation. In data imbalance setting, minority classes are over-sampled to improve the performance of the classifier. Existing methods are unable to learn the distribution of the minority class and effects the performance of classifier. In this research, we introduced a data generative model (DGM) to improve the minority class presence in the anomaly detection domain. Our approach is based on a conditional generative adversarial network to generate synthetic samples for minority classes. It includes the KL-divergence to guide the model towards the true learning of minority class distribution. In this way, model learns the complex underlying data distribution and generates new samples. We performed experiments over the two benchmark datasets NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 that are publicly available to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, the comparative analysis with the existing approaches confirms the stability and superiority of our presented model. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Cybersecurity; Data balancing; Generative adversarial network; Intrusion detection system","Classification (of information); Learning systems; Abnormal behavior; Adversarial networks; Benchmark datasets; Class distributions; Comparative analysis; Data distribution; Multi-class classification; Performance of classifier; Anomaly detection","Abdi, L., Hashemi, S., To combat multi-class imbalanced problems by means of over-sampling techniques (2015) IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng, 28 (1), pp. 238-251; (2019) Improving Detection of Credit Card Fraudulent Transactions Using Generative Adversarial Networks.

In recent years, numerous enterprises have acknowledged the benefits of cloud-based service models. However, the security issues are a major concern, such as stealthy malware attacks against virtual domains. In this article, we propose an introspection based security approach, called VMShield for securing virtual domains in a cloud based service platform, which is designed to detect malware in cloud infrastructure. VMShield performs virtual memory introspection from the hypervisor (trusted-domain) to collect the run-time behavior of processes, making it impossible for the malware to evade the security tool. The use of introspection makes the proposed approach a better choice over traditional static and dynamic state-of-the-art techniques which fail to detect stealthy attacks. The VMShield extracts the system call features using Bag of n-gram approach and selects important features using the meta-heuristic algorithm, binary particle swarm optimization. Random Forest (RF) classifier is used to classify the monitored programs into benign and malign processes, making it capable of detecting the variants of malware thus, an advantage over the typical signature-matching approach. The University of New Mexico (UNM) Dataset and Bare cloud Dataset (University of California) has been used for the demonstration and validation of VMShield. The results prove that VMShield achieves a higher attack detection rate and reduced storage compared to previously proposed techniques. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Binary particle swarm optimization; cloud security; dynamic analysis; intrusion detection; machine learning; malware detection; meta-heuristics; VM introspection","Decision trees; Heuristic algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Service industry; Binary particle swarm optimization; Cloud infrastructures; Important features; Industrial standards; Meta heuristic algorithm; State-of-the-art techniques; University of California; University of New Mexico; Malware","Umbehocker, S.M., Methods and systems for automated management of virtual resources in a cloud computing environment (2014) U.S. Patent 8 918 488; Henriquez, M., The top 12 data breaches of 2019 (2019) Dec, , https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/91366-thetop-12-data-breaches-of-2019; (2020) At Least 95 Pc of Cloud Security Failures Will Be Organization's Fault, , https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/digital-security/65438790, ETCIO 2022; Ramaswami, S., (2020) What Global Manufacturers Need to Know about Security in the Cloud, , https://www.mbtmag.com/cloudcomputing/article/13228140/what-global-manufacturers-need-to-knowabout-security-in-the-cloud; Wang, T., Ke, H., Zheng, X., Wang, K., Sangaiah, A.K., Liu, A., Big data cleaning based on mobile edge computing in industrial sensorcloud (2020) IEEE Trans.

The ego vehicle senses or receives information, such as the position, velocity, acceleration, or even intention, of the leading vehicle and controls its own behavior. However, it has been shown that sensors and wireless channels are vulnerable to security attacks, and attackers can modify data sensed from sensors or received from other vehicles. To address this problem, in this paper, we design three types of stealthy attacks on ACC or CACC inputs, where the stealthy attacks can deceive a rule-based detection approach and impede system properties (collision-freeness and vehicle-following distance). We then develop two deep-learning models, a predictor-based model and an encoder-decoder- based model to detect the attacks, where the two models do not need attacker models for training. The experimental results demonstrate the respective strengths of different models and lead to a methodology for the design of learning-based intrusion detection approaches. © 2021 IEEE.",,"Adaptive control systems; Autonomous vehicles; Chemical detection; Deep learning; Intrusion detection; Autonomous vehicle-following; Cooperative adaptive cruise control; Intrusion-Detection; Leading vehicle; Safety stability; Sensor channels; String stability; Vehicle following; Vehicle following systems; Wireless channel; Adaptive cruise control","Petit, J., Stottelaar, B., Feiri, M., Kargl, F., Remote attacks on automated vehicles sensors: Experiments on camera and lidar (2015) Black Hat Europe, 11; Yan, C., Xu, W., Liu, J., Can you trust autonomous vehicles: Contactless attacks against sensors of self-driving vehicle (2016) DEF CON, 24; Parkinson, S., Ward, P., Wilson, K., Miller, J., Cyber threats facing autonomous and connected vehicles: Future challenges (2017) IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS), 18 (11), pp. 2898-2915; Amoozadeh, M., Raghuramu, A., Chuah, C.-N., Ghosal, D., Zhang, H.M., Rowe, J., Levitt, K., Security vulnerabilities of connected vehicle streams and their impact on cooperative driving (2015) IEEE Com-munications Magazine, 53 (6), pp. 126-132; Heijden Der Van, R., Lukaseder, T., Kargl, F., Analyzing attacks on cooperative adaptive cruise control (cacc) (2017) IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC).

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a crucial role as a defense mechanism in networks against adversarial attackers. Machine Learning methods provide various cybersecurity tools. However, these methods require plenty of data to be trained efficiently, which may be hard to collect or to use due to privacy reasons. One of the most notable Machine Learning tools is the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and it has great potential for tabular data synthesis. In this work, we start by briefly presenting the most popular GAN architectures, VanillaGAN, WGAN, and WGAN-GP. Focusing on tabular data generation, CTGAN, CopulaGAN, and TableGAN models are used for the creation of synthetic IDS data. Specifically, the models are trained and evaluated on an NSL-KDD dataset, considering the limitations and require-ments that this procedure needs. Finally, based on certain quantitative and qualitative methods, we argue and evaluate the most prominent GANs for tabular network data synthesis. © 2021 by the authors.

Using neural-based data augmentation techniques for data generation and deep convolutional models for classification would enhance the performance of the applications mentioned above. Recently, GANs (generative adversarial networks) showed significant improvements in generating images. In this paper, a model that uses a conditioned deep convolutional GAN and an auxiliary classifier are proposed to tackle the aforementioned issues. The conditioned GAN is used for data generation of minority classes images and noisy images. Another auxiliary deep convolutional model is employed for the classification of images on data augmented dataset. Also, a multi-hinge loss is employed in both the data augmentation and classification tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed model is investigated on the quality of generated images and classification metrics using four publicly available popular datasets: MNIST, EMNIST, CIFAR10, and SVHN. The proposed model has shown significant improvements over the other often used models of data augmentation and multi-class imbalance image classification in terms of generated samples and classification accuracy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Adversarial network; Convolutional neural network; Data augmentation; Generative model; Imbalanced data",,"Ali, A., Shamsuddin, S.M., Ralescu, A.L., Classification with class imbalance problem: a review (2015) Int J Advance Soft Compu Appl, 7 (3), pp. 176-204; Ali-Gombe, A., Elyan, E., MFC-GAN: class-imbalanced dataset classification using multiple fake class generative adversarial network (2019) Neurocomputing, 361, pp. 212-221; Jayne C (2018) Few-shot classifier GAN 2018 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, pp. 1-8. , IJCNN, IEEE; Antipov, G., Baccouche, M., Dugelay, J.L., Face aging with conditional generative adversarial networks (2017) 2017 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), IEEE, pp. 2089-2093; Brock, A., Lim, T., Ritchie, J.M., Weston, N., (2016), Neural photo editing with introspective adversarial networks; Bunkhumpornpat, C., Sinapiromsaran, K., Lursinsap, C., Dbsmote: density-based synthetic minority over-sampling technique (2012) Appl Intell, 36 (3), pp. 664-684; Chawla, N.V., Bowyer, K.W., Hall, L.O., Kegelmeyer, W.P., Smote: synthetic minority over-sampling technique (2002) J Art Intell Res, 16, pp. 321-357; Choi, Y., Choi, M., Kim, M., Ha, J.W., Kim, S., Choo, J., Stargan: Unified generative adversarial networks for multi-domain image-to-image translation (2018) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 8789-8797; Goodfellow, I., Pouget-Abadie, J., Mirza, M., Xu, B., Warde-Farley, D., Ozair, S., Courville, A., Bengio, Y., Generative adversarial nets (2014) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2672-2680; Han, H., Wang, W.Y., Mao, B.H., Borderline-smote: A new over-sampling method in imbalanced data sets learning (2005) International Conference on Intelligent Computing, Springer, pp. 878-887; He, H., Bai, Y., Garcia, E.A., Li, S., (2008) Adasyn: Adaptive synthetic sampling approach for imbalanced learning 2008 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, pp. 1322-1328. , IEEE world congress on computational intelligence, IEEE; Im, D.J., Kim, C.D., Jiang, H., Memisevic, R., (2016) Generating Images with Recurrent Adversarial Networks, , arXiv preprint; Isola, P., Zhu, J.Y., Zhou, T., Efros, A.A., Image-to-image translation with conditional adversarial networks (2017) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1125-1134; Karras, T., Aila, T., Laine, S., Lehtinen, J., (2017) Progressive growing of gans for improved quality, stability, and variation; Kavalerov, I., Czaja, W., Chellappa, R., (2019) Cgans with Multi-Hinge Loss; Kim, T., Cha, M., Kim, H., Lee, J.K., Kim, J., Learning to discover cross-domain relations with generative adversarial networks (2017) Proceedings of the 34Th International Conference on Machine Learning, 70, pp. 1857-1865; Krawczyk, B., Learning from imbalanced data: open challenges and future directions (2016) Prog Art Intell, 5 (4), pp. 221-232; Kupyn, O., Budzan, V., Mykhailych, M., Mishkin, D., Matas, J., Deblurgan: Blind motion deblurring using conditional adversarial networks (2018) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 8183-8192; Kwak, H., Zhang, B.T., (2016) Generating Images Part by Part with Composite Generative Adversarial Networks; Ledig, C., Theis, L., Huszár, F., Caballero, J., Cunningham, A., Acosta, A., Aitken, A., Wang, Z., Photo-realistic single image super-resolution using a generative adversarial network (2017) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 4681-4690; Li, C., Wand, M., Precomputed real-time texture synthesis with markovian generative adversarial networks (2016) European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 702-716. , Springer; Li, J., Liang, X., Wei, Y., Xu, T., Feng, J., Yan, S., Perceptual generative adversarial networks for small object detection (2017) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1222-1230; Liu, M.Y., Tuzel, O., Coupled generative adversarial networks (2016) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 469-477; Liu, Y., Peng, Y., Wang, B., Yao, S., Liu, Z., Review on cyber-physical systems (2017) IEEE/CAA J Automatica Sinica, 4 (1), pp. 27-40; Masi, I., Trán, A.T., Hassner, T., Leksut, J.T., Medioni, G., Do we really need to collect millions of faces for effective face recognition?

Thus, IoT-based networks are most vulnerable to simple or complex attacks that need to be identified in the early stage of data transmission for saving the network from these malicious attacks. The chief goal of the proposed work is to design and form the intelligent intrusion detection system (I-IDS) using the machine learning models such that the attacks can be identified in the IoT network. The model is built considering the normal and malicious attacks on the data that are generated in IoT smart environment. To simulate such a model, a testbed is built where a wireless router, a DHT11 sensor, and a node MCU are being used during the design phase. An attacker or adversarial system is built to perform poisoning and sniffing attacks using a laptop system. The node captures the sensor values and transmits the data to the ThinkSpeak platform, during the normal phase via the wireless gateway, and in the attack phase, the malicious attacker interprets the data, modifies it while transmitting from node to the ThinkSpeak server. Thus, the attack called Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) is performed and classified as abnormal data. Various machine learning algorithms are performed on the data, and finally, the results obtained using a probabilistic model called as Markov model have a high performance evaluated based on the I-IDS IoT network. The results obtained during the experimental analysis show that the Markov model has obtained a 100% detection rate and 19% of false alarm rate (FAR) with high precision and low error rate. The algorithms such as naïve Bayes classifier, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, and Adaboost are considered in comparison with the Markov model. The optimal solution is obtained concerning other evaluation metrics like sensitivity, F1, and true-positive rate (TPR). Therefore, the integrated network of IoT-WSN with its performance metrics is tabulated to show the potentials of securing a network system. Additionally, the proposed work gives a high level of security for IoT smart environment as compared with the other machine learning algorithms using the novel technique of intelligent IDS. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cloud computing; Computing; Fog computing; Internet of Things (IoT); Intrusion detection; Security; Wireless sensor network (WSN)","Adaptive boosting; Computer crime; Data communication systems; Decision trees; Gateways (computer networks); Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Markov processes; Network security; Routers; Support vector machines; Basic characteristics; Experimental analysis; Intelligent Intrusion detection systems; Internet of thing (IOT); Machine learning models; Man in the middles (MITM); Probabilistic modeling; True positive rates; Internet of things","Alaparthy, V.T., Morgera, S.D., A multi_level intrusion detection system for wireless sensor networks based on immune theory (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 47364-47373; Ammar, M., Russello, G., Crispo, B., Internet of Things: a survey on the security of IoT frameworks (2018) J Inf Secure Appl, 38, pp. 8-27; Arshad, J., Azad, M.A., Abdeltaif, M.M., Salah, K., An intrusion detection framework for energy-constrained IoT devices (2020) Mech Syst Signal Process, 136, p. 106436; Breitenbacher, D., Homoliak, I., Aung, Y.L., Tippenhauer, N.O., Elovici, Y., HADES-IoT: A practical host-based anomaly detection system for IoT devices (2019) Proc.

For IDS technology to improve, a next-generation cyber defense is proposed in which cyber attacks are unconventionally reimagined as free sources of live IDS training data. Rather than aborting attacks against legitimate services, adversarial interactions are selectively prolonged to maximize the defender's harvest of useful threat intelligence. Enhancing web services with deceptive attack-responses in this way is shown to be a powerful and practical strategy for improved detection, addressing several perennial challenges for machine learning-based IDS in the literature, including scarcity of training data, the high labeling burden for (semi-)supervised learning, encryption opacity, and concept differences between honeypot attacks and those against genuine services. By reconceptualizing software security patches as feature extraction engines, the approach conscripts attackers as free penetration testers, and coordinates multiple levels of the software stack to achieve fast, automatic, and accurate labeling of live web streams. Prototype implementations are showcased for two feature set models to extract security-relevant network- and system-level features from cloud services hosting enterprise-grade web applications. The evaluation demonstrates that the extracted data can be fed back into a network-level IDS for exceptionally accurate, yet lightweight attack detection. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cloud computing; Cyberdeception; Datasets; Honeypots; Intrusion detection; Neural networks; Software-as-a-service","Computer crime; Cryptography; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Web services; Attack detection; Intrusion detection system (IDSes); Learning experiences; Multiple levels; Prototype implementations; Software security; Software stacks; WEB application; Network security","Vulnerability statistics report (2019); Internet Security Threat Report, Vol. 23 (2018); The future of cybercrime and security: Key takeaways and juniper leaderboard (2017); Denning, D.E., An intrusion-detection model (1987) IEEE Trans Softw Eng (TSE), 13 (2), pp. 222-232; Sager, T., Killing advanced threats in their tracks: An intelligent approach to attack prevention (2014) InfoSec Read Room; DiMaggio, J., The Black Vine cyberespionage group (2015) Symantec Security Response; Jeng, A., Minimizing damage from J.P.

However, this has also created an additional attack vector; the machine learning models which support the IDS's decisions may also be subject to cyberattacks known as Adversarial Machine Learning (AML). In the context of IoT, AML can be used to manipulate data and network traffic that traverse through such devices. These perturbations increase the confusion in the decision boundaries of the machine learning classifier, where malicious network packets are often miss-classified as being benign. Consequently, such errors are bypassed by machine learning based detectors, which increases the potential of significantly delaying attack detection and further consequences such as personal information leakage, damaged hardware, and financial loss. Given the impact that these attacks may have, this paper proposes a rule-based approach towards generating AML attack samples and explores how they can be used to target a range of supervised machine learning classifiers used for detecting Denial of Service attacks in an IoT smart home network. The analysis explores which DoS packet features to perturb and how such adversarial samples can support increasing the robustness of supervised models using adversarial training. The results demonstrated that the performance of all the top performing classifiers were affected, decreasing a maximum of 47.2 percentage points when adversarial samples were present. Their performances improved following adversarial training, demonstrating their robustness towards such attacks. © 2021","Adversarial machine learning; Attack detection; Internet of things (IoT); Intrusion detection systems; Networking; Smart homes; Supervised machine learning","Automation; Denial-of-service attack; Home networks; Intelligent buildings; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Losses; Network security; Personal communication systems; Supervised learning; Adversarial machine learning; Attack detection; Cyber-attacks; Internet of thing; Intrusion Detection Systems; Learning classifiers; Machine-learning; Networking; Smart homes; Supervised machine learning; Internet of things","Abusnaina, A., Khormali, A., Alasmary, H., Park, J., Anwar, A., Mohaisen, A., Adversarial learning attacks on graph-based IoT malware detection systems (2019) 2019 IEEE 39th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS), pp. 1296-1305. , IEEE; Alazab, A., Hobbs, M., Abawajy, J., Alazab, M., Using feature selection for intrusion detection system (2012) 2012 International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT), pp. 296-301. , IEEE; Amouri, A., Alaparthy, V.T., Morgera, S.D., Cross layer-based intrusion detection based on network behavior for IoT (2018) Wireless and Microwave Technology Conference (WAMICON), 2018 IEEE 19th, pp. 1-4. , IEEE; Anthi, E., Williams, L., Malgortzata, G., Theodorakopoulos, G., Burnap, P., A supervised intrusion detection system for smart home IoT (2018) IEEE Internet Things J., 78, pp. 477-490; Anthi, E., Williams, L., Rhode, M., Burnap, P., Wedgbury, A., Adversarial attacks on machine learning cybersecurity defences in industrial control systems (2021) J.

However, ML/DL has shown to be extremely vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially in such security-sensitive systems. Many adversarial attacks have been proposed to evaluate the robustness of ML-based NIDSs. Unfortunately, existing attacks mostly focused on feature-space and/or white-box attacks, which make impractical assumptions in real-world scenarios, leaving the study on practical gray/black-box attacks largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first systematic study of the gray/black-box traffic-space adversarial attacks to evaluate the robustness of ML-based NIDSs. Our work outperforms previous ones in the following aspects: (i) practical - the proposed attack can automatically mutate original traffic with extremely limited knowledge and affordable overhead while preserving its functionality; (ii) generic - the proposed attack is effective for evaluating the robustness of various NIDSs using diverse ML/DL models and non-payload-based features; (iii) explainable - we propose an explanation method for the fragile robustness of ML-based NIDSs. Based on this, we also propose a defense scheme against adversarial attacks to improve system robustness. We extensively evaluate the robustness of various NIDSs using diverse feature sets and ML/DL models. Experimental results show our attack is effective (e.g., >97% evasion rate in half cases for Kitsune, a state-of-the-art NIDS) with affordable execution cost and the proposed defense method can effectively mitigate such attacks (evasion rate is reduced by >50% in most cases). © 1983-2012 IEEE.","adversarial machine learning; evasion attack; machine learning security; Network anomaly detection; network intrusion detection systems","Deep learning; Intrusion detection; Network security; Diverse features; Network intrusion detection systems; Network intrusions; Real-world scenario; Sensitive systems; State of the art; System robustness; Systematic study; Learning systems","García-Teodoro, P., Díaz-Verdejo, J., Maciá-Fernández, G., Vázquez, E., Anomaly-based network intrusion detection: Techniques, systems and challenges (2009) Comput.

Yet, Deep neural network (DNN) models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. An attacker can use a generator, here a Generative Adversarial Network, to alter an attack so that the IDS model misclassify it as normal network traffic. There is a race between adversarial attacks and mechanisms to make robust IDSs, like Adversarial Training. To our knowledge, no study thoroughly assesses how attack generators or IDS training is sensitive to parameters controlling resources spent during training. Such results provide insights on how much to spend on IDS training. This paper presents the outcome of this assessment for GANs vs adversarial training. Interestingly, it shows that GANs' evasion capabilities are either very good or poor, with almost no average cases. Resources impact the likelihood of obtaining an efficient generator. © 2021 IEEE.","Adversarial machine learning; GAN; Intrusion Detection System; Sensitivity analysis","Anomaly detection; Deep neural networks; Intrusion detection; Network security; Adversarial networks; Average case; Detection accuracy; Network based intrusion detection systems; Network traffic; Training effects; Neural networks","Biggio, B., Evasion attacks against machine learning at test time (2013) Ecml Pkdd; Chen, P.-Y., Zoo: Zeroth order optimization based black-box attacks to deep neural networks without training substitute models (2017) Proceedings of the 10th ACM-AISec; Goodfellow, I., Shlens, J., Szegedy, C., Explaining and harnessing adversarial examples (2015) Iclr; Ilyas, A., Black-box adversarial attacks with limited queries and information (2018) Icml, 80; Lin, Z., Shi, Y., Xue, Z., (2018) IDSGAN: Generative Adversarial Networks for Attack Generation against Intrusion Detection; Msika, S., Quintero, A., Khomh, F., (2019) Sigma : Strengthening Ids with Gan and Metaheuristics Attacks; Qiu, S., Review of artificial intelligence adversarial attack and defense technologies (2019) Applied Sciences, 9; Ren, K., Adversarial attacks and defenses in deep learning (2020) Engineering, 6 (3); Ring, M., A survey of network-based intrusion detection data sets (2019) Computers &Security, 86; Samangouei, P., Kabkab, M., Chellappa, R., Defense-GAN: Protecting classifiers against adversarial attacks using generative models (2018) Iclr; Sharafaldin, I., Lashkari, A.H., Ghorbani, A.A., Toward generating a new intrusion detection dataset and intrusion traffic characterization (2018) Icissp; Tavallaee, M., A detailed analysis of the KDD CUP 99 data set (2009) IEEE Cisda, pp. 1-6; Usama, M., Generative adversarial networks for launching and thwarting adversarial attacks on network intrusion detection systems (2019) Iwcmc; Yang, K., Adversarial examples against the deep learning based network intrusion detection systems (2018) Milcom; Zhang, S., Xie, X., Xu, Y., A brute-force black-box method to attack machine learning-based systems in cybersecurity (2020) IEEE Access, 8",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781665402859,,,"English","Proc.

However, most attention was paid to the improvement of the performance of the target system while few to the security issues of the neural network itself. The online learning network uses the constant network traffic as the training data to achieve lower memory usage, better adaptation to the environment over time, and an infinite amount of training data. Due to the existence of network attacks specifically designed for neural networks such as poison attacks and evasion attacks, as well as the existence of the false positives of the model itself, suspicious traffic will be inevitably put into training, resulting in performance drops or even collapse. Furthermore, autoencoder based anomaly detection needs pure normal data for train, which is more dangerous in the situation mentioned above. This article proposes a novel idea to improve the training process of autoencoder based NIDS under online learning. Since the training data in online learning can be regarded as infinite, we can randomly throw away a part of the data that is about to enter training. Experiments were implemented by the DAE-based anomaly detection algorithm and KDD99 datasets. It can be known that performance deduction can be significantly alleviated by tuning the leakage ratio and accuracy decrease can be suppressed effectively. © 2021 ACM.","Anomaly Detection,; Autoencoder; Network Intrusion Detection; Online Learning","Anomaly detection; Computer crime; E-learning; Intrusion detection; Anomaly detection; Anomaly detection,; Auto encoders; Network intrusion detection; Network intrusion detection systems; Neural-networks; Online learning; Performance; Target systems; Training data; Learning systems","Yisroel, M., Tomer, D., Yuval, E., Asaf, S., (2018) Kitsune: An Ensemble of Autoencoders for Online Network Intrusion Detection, , arXiv preprint arXiv 1802 09089; Nirmalya, T., Han Chia, Y., An Approach for Detection ofWalking Related Falls during Activities of Daily Living (2020) 2020 International Conference on Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things Engineering ICBAIE, pp. 280-283; Soto, C., Tavakolizadeh, F.J.A., Dávid, G., An online machine learning framework for early detection of product failures in an Industry 4.0 context (2019) International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing, 32, pp. 452-465; Rupam Kumar, S., Hemanta Kr, K., Biju, I., Are machine learning based intrusion detection system always secure?

As the number of IoT devices grows exponentially, intrusion detection on the back-end servers or indeed even the fog will become intractable. Consequently, there is a need to move intrusion detection closer to the IoT edge. Doing so will have a significant impact on the network as well as the compute required on the server-side. In this paper, we show how deep learning can be used to build state-of-the intrusion detection algorithms that can be executed on small routers near the IoT edge. Adversarial autoencoders with the K nearest neighbor algorithm were trained on the NSL-KDD intrusion data set to yield state-of-the-art results. The model had an accuracy of 99.991% and an F1-Score of 0.9990. On a Raspberry PI 3B (RPI) device, using TensorFlow Lite, the model achieved an average per-packet latency of less than 16ms which is sufficient for many IoT sensors on the edge giving a worst-case bandwidth of 3kibts/second. © 2021 IEEE.","Adversarial Autoencoder; edge computing; IoT; K Nearest Neighbor; Network Intrusion Detection; SMOTE","Deep learning; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Pattern recognition; Back-end servers; Intrusion data; Intrusion detection algorithms; K nearest neighbor algorithm; Network intrusion detection; Network intrusion detection systems; Packet latencies; Server sides; Internet of things","NSL-KDD Intrusion Detection Dataset, , https://www.kaggle.com/what0919/intrusion-detection; Tavallaee, M., Bagheri, E., Lu, W., Ghorbani, A., A detailed analysis of the kdd cup 99 data set (2009) Ieee Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Security and Defense Applications, , July; Makhzani, A., Shlens, J., Jaitly, N., Goodfellow, I., Frey, B., Adversarial autoencoders (2016) ArXiv151105644 Cs, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05644, May; Puuska, S., Kokkonen, T., Alatalo, J., Heilimo, E., Anomaly-based network intrusion detection using wavelets and adversarial autoencoders (2019) Innovative Security Solutions for Information Technology and Communications, pp. 234-246. , Cham, Springer; Olusola, A., Oladele, A., Abosede, D., Analysis of kdd '99 intrusion detection dataset for selection of relevance features (2010) World Congress on Engineering and Computer Science, p. 20; Ieracitano, C., Statistical analysis driven optimized deep learning system for intrusion detection (2018) ArXiv180805633 Cs, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05633, Aug; Wu, K., Chen, Z., Li, W., A novel intrusion detection model for a massive network using convolutional neural networks (2018) Ieee Access, 6, pp. 50850-50859. , September; Xiao, Y., Xing, C., Zhang, T., Zhao, Z., An intrusion detection model based on feature reduction and convolutional neural networks (2019) Ieee Access, 7, pp. 42210-42219. , March; Zhang, L., Li, M., Wang, X., Huang, Y., An improved network intrusion detection based on deep neural network (2019) Iop Conf.

For example, the identification of anomaly patterns on infrastructure sensor curves helps locate equipment failures. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection approach for time series, which can comprehensively consider both point anomalies and subsequence anomalies. We innovatively introduce RNN into the architecture of Adversarial Autoencoder to better analyze anomaly events based on overall relationship of time series. In addition, we innovatively apply the Outlier Exposure technique for the performance optimization of anomaly detector. Meanwhile, a WGAN-based method is utilized to generate anomaly datasets through normal distribution learning. Finally, we apply the proposed method for fraud detection on a financial statement dataset and intrusion detection on a network traffic dataset. Experimental results demonstrates that our model can comprehensively consider different anomaly types in time series, and achieve promising detection performance overall. In the experiment of fraud detection, the LSTM integrated AAE model achieves an F1 score of 0.810, while the Outlier Exposure enhanced model achieves an F1 score of 0.894. This indicates that our method can improve the performance of current audit systems and facilitate discovering malicious behaviors. © 2021 ACM.","Adversarial Autoencoder; anomaly detection; time series","Crime; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Management information systems; Normal distribution; Time series; Anomaly detector; Anomaly patterns; Detection performance; Equipment failures; Financial statements; Malicious behavior; Performance optimizations; Unsupervised anomaly detection; Anomaly detection","Akcay, S., Atapour Abarghouei, A., Breckon, T.P., (2018) 2018 GANomaly: Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection Via Adversarial Training.

However, adversarial alterations of the sensor data can disrupt the occupants’ comfort or increase energy consumption. Several intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are proposed to detect the tempering of the sensor measurements. However, these approaches either demonstrate a high false alarm rate or fail to detect anomalies, putting the HVAC control or the building occupants in a vulnerable condition. This paper proposes a novel intrusion detection technique amalgamating two unsupervised machine learning techniques, namely autoencoder(AE) and one-class support vector machine (OCSVM), for identifying abnormality in smart building sensor measurements. Our experimental analysis shows that the AE model-based anomaly detector demonstrates satisfactory performance for lowering false alarms but fails to detect a number of anomalous samples. In contrast, the OCSVM-based anomaly detection model performs significantly well for anomaly detection while raises a lot of false alarms. Our proposed ensembled AE-OCSVM model combines both models’ benefits, resulting in significant reductions of false positive and false negative rates compared to the existing smart building IDSs. We evaluate the proposed intrusion detection system on the commercial occupancy dataset (COD) and find that the proposed IDS model can achieve a 99.6% F1-score. © 2021 IEEE.","Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Unsupervised learning","Air conditioning; Alarm systems; Application programs; Computer crime; Control systems; Energy utilization; Errors; HVAC; Intelligent buildings; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Network security; Real time systems; Support vector machines; Anomaly detection models; Building control systems; Experimental analysis; False positive and false negatives; Internet of thing (IOT); Intrusion Detection Systems; One-class support vector machines (OCSVM); Unsupervised machine learning; Anomaly detection","(2019) 5 Key Benefits of Smart Buildings, , https://www.trueoccupancy.com/blog/5-key-benefits-of-smart-buildings, accessed: 2021-01-10; Learn How Smart Hvac Technology Is Designed to Modernize Your Workplace, , https://serraview.com/smart-hvac-sensor-technology-smart-buildings, accessed: 2021-01-23; (2021) Smart Buildings at High Risk for Cyber Attacks: Study, , https://www.facilitiesnet.com/buildingautomation/tip/Smart-Buildings-At-High-Risk-for-Cyber-Attacks-Study-44839, accessed: 2021-01-11; (2021) Smart Building Automation Systems Vulnerable to Cyber Attack, , https://inbuildingtech.com/smart-buildings/cyber-attack-smart-building-iot/, accessed: 2021-01-15; Aleroud, A., Karabatis, G., Toward zero-day attack identification using linear data transformation techniques (2013) 2013 IEEE 7th International Conference on Software Security and Reliability, pp. 159-168; Zhu, Y., Xiao, Z., Chen, Y., Li, Z., Liu, M., Zhao, B.Y., Zheng, H., (2018) Et Tu Alexa?

Facing challenges of the rapidly increasing amount of diverse network traffic, recent research has employed end-to-end deep learning-based intrusion detectors for automatic feature extraction and high detection accuracy. However, deep learning has been proved vulnerable to adversarial attacks that may cause misclassification by imposing imperceptible perturbation on input samples. Though such vulnerability is widely discussed in the image processing domain, very few studies have investigated its perniciousness against network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and proposed corresponding defense strategies. In this paper, we try to fill this gap by proposing Def-IDS, an ensemble defense mechanism specially designed for NIDS, against both known and unknown adversarial attacks. It is a two-module training framework that integrates multi-class generative adversarial networks and multi-source adversarial retraining to improve model robustness, while the detection accuracy on unperturbed samples is maintained. We evaluate the mechanism over CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset and compare its performance with the other three defense methods. The results demonstrate that Def-IDS is able to detect various adversarial attacks with better precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. © 2021 IEEE.","adversarial attacks; deep learning; Network intrusion detection","Feature extraction;

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) can mitigate the security threats by detecting abnormal network behaviours. However, existing IDS solutions are limited to detect abnormal network behaviors under local sub-networks rather than the entire VANET. To address this problem, we utilize deep learning with generative adversarial networks and explore distributed SDN to design a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) for VANETs, which enables multiple SDN controllers jointly train a global intrusion detection model for the entire network without directly exchanging their sub-network flows. We prove the correctness of our CIDS in both IID (Independent Identically Distribution) and non-IID situations, and also evaluate its performance through both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset. Detailed experimental results validate that our CIDS is efficient and effective in intrusion detection for VANETs. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Collaborative intrusion detection; deep learning; distributed SDN; generative adversarial networks; intelligent transportation","Computer crime; Deep learning; Intelligent systems; Intrusion detection; Network security; Adversarial networks; Collaborative intrusion detection system; Enabling technologies; Experimental evaluation; Intelligent transportation systems; Intrusion detection models; Intrusion Detection Systems; Sub-network flows; Vehicular ad hoc networks","Wang, D., Chen, D., Song, B., Guizani, N., Yu, X., Du, X., From IoT to 5G I-IoT: The next generation IoT-based intelligent algorithms and 5G technologies (2018) IEEE Commun.

Deep learning models are the current mainstream intrusion detection techniques for threat analysis, and the state-of-the-art intrusion detection technique introduces the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) model to generate usable attacked samples to supplement the training samples, but it exists the limitations of rough CAN message block construction and fails to detect the data tampering threat. Based on the CAN communication matrix defined by the automotive Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for a vehicle model, we propose an enhanced deep learning GAN model with elaborate CAN message blocks and the enhanced GAN discriminator. The elaborate CAN message blocks in the training samples can precisely reflect the real generated CAN message blocks in the detection phase. The GAN discriminator can detect whether each message has suffered from the data tampering threat. Experimental results illustrate that the enhanced deep learning GAN model has higher detection accuracy, recall, and F1 scores than the state-of-the-art deep learning GAN model under various attacks and threats. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Automotive networks; deep learning; intrusion detection; threat analysis","Automobile manufacture; Autonomous vehicles; Control system synthesis; Deep learning; Learning systems; Sampling; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Adversarial networks; Autonomous driving; Block construction; CAN communications; Controller area network; Detection accuracy; Model-based intrusion detection; Original equipment manufacturers; Intrusion detection","Bräuninger, J., Emig, R., Küttner, T., Loffler, A., Controller area network for truck and bus applications (1990) SAE Trans., 99, pp. 704-714. , Jan; Wu, W., A survey of intrusion detection for in-vehicle networks (2020) IEEE Trans.

Although a variety of methods have been designed to leverage DL models for security protection, whether these systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs) is unknown. In this article, we design a novel adversarial attack against DL-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) in the Internet-of-Things environment, with only black-box accesses to the DL model in such NIDS. We introduce two techniques: 1) model extraction is adopted to replicate the black-box model with a small amount of training data and 2) a saliency map is then used to disclose the impact of each packet attribute on the detection results, and the most critical features. This enables us to efficiently generate AEs using conventional methods. With these tehniques, we successfully compromise one state-of-the-art NIDS, Kitsune: the adversary only needs to modify less than 0.005% of bytes in the malicious packets to achieve an average 94.31% attack success rate. © 2014 IEEE.","Adversarial examples (AEs); Deep learning (DL); Internet of Things (IoT); Network intrusion detection","Computer crime; Deep learning; Internet of things; Conventional methods; Critical features; Malicious packets; Network activities; Network intrusion detection; Network intrusion detection systems; Security protection; State of the art; Intrusion detection","Garciá-Teodoro, P., Diáz-Verdejo, J., Maciá-Fernández, G., Vázquez, E., Anomaly-based network intrusion detection: Techniques, systems and challenges (2009) Comput.

In the case of software-defined networks (SDN), not only the connected devices and services but also the SDN controllers may be subjected to intrusion attempts. The advent of efficient and robust machine learning (ML) algorithms along with the availability of a large number of network datasets enabled the development of ML-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Recent work has demonstrated that ML-based NIDS systems are vulnerable to evasion attacks where the adversary targets the ML classifier in the NIDS system to evade detection by performing various packet perturbations. In this work, we propose an approach to build robust ML based NIDS systems that use multiple ML classifiers trained with reduced feature sets. Our approach depends on a careful feature selection procedure based on Permutation Feature Importance, a wrapper based feature engineering method. Our evaluations on well-known datasets show that the proposed hybrid multi-classifier system is robust and performs well against the packet perturbation attacks considered in this work. © 2021 IEEE.","Adversarial evasion attacks; Feature engineering; Intrusion detection systems; Machine learning; Multi-classifier systems; Software defined networks","Classification (of information); Intrusion detection; Large dataset; Feature engineerings; Feature sets; Multiclassifier system; Network intrusion detection systems; Network-based; Networked systems; Security threats; Selection procedures; Machine learning","Corona, I., Giacinto, G., Roli, F., Adversarial attacks against intrusion detection systems: Taxonomy, solutions and open issues (2013) IS; Xie, J., Yu, F.R., Huang, T., Xie, R., Liu, J., Wang, C., Liu, Y., A survey of machine learning techniques applied to software defined networking: Research issues and challenges (2019) IEEE CST; Aiken, S.S.J., Investigating adversarial attacks against network intrusion detection systems in sdns (2019) IEEE Conference NFV-SDN; http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html, Kdd cup 1999 dataset; Sharafaldin, I., Lashkari, A.H., Ghorbani, A., Toward generating a new intrusion detection dataset and intrusion traffic characterization (2018) ICISSP; Gharaibeh, M., (2009) DARPA 2009 Intrusion Detection Dataset, , http://www.darpa2009.netsec.colostate.edu; Lee, S., Kim, J., Shin, S., Porras, P., Yegneswaran, V., Athena: A framework for scalable anomaly detection in software-defined networks (2017) 47th Annual International Conference on DSN; Niyaz, Q., Sun, W., Javaid, A.Y., A deep learning based ddos detection system in software-defined networking (2017) EAI Endorsed Transactions on Security and Safety; Hashemi, M.J., Keller, E., (2020) Enhancing Robustness against Adversarial Examples in Network Intrusion Detection Systems; Zhang, F., Chan, P.P.K., Biggio, B., Yeung, D.S., Roli, F., Adversarial feature selection against evasion attacks (2016) IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics; Pawlicki, M., Chorás, M., Kozik, R., Defending network intrusion detection systems against adversarial evasion attacks (2020) FGCS; Polat, H., Polat, O., Cetin, A., Detecting ddos attacks in softwaredefined networks through feature selection methods and machine learning models (2020) Sustainability; Guyon, I., Elisseeff, A., An introduction to variable and feature selection (2003) J.

Given a trained classifier, a malicious attack may attempt to craft a data observation whereby the data features purposefully trigger the classifier to yield incorrect responses. This has been observed in various image classification tasks, including falsifying road sign detection and facial recognition, which could have severe consequences in real-world deployment. In this work, we investigate how these attacks could impact on network traffic analysis, and how a system could perform misclassification of common network attacks such as DDoS attacks. Using the CICIDS2017 data, we examine how vulnerable the data features used for intrusion detection are to perturbation attacks using FGSM adversarial examples. As a result, our method provides a defensive approach for assessing feature robustness that seeks to balance between classification accuracy whilst minimising the attack surface of the feature space. © 2021 IEEE.","adversarial learning; machine learning; network traffic analysis","Denial-of-service attack; Face recognition; Intrusion detection; Network security; Traffic signs; Classification accuracy; Facial recognition; Malicious attack; Misclassifications; Network traffic analysis; Real world deployment; Road sign detection; Robustness assessment; Machine learning","Sfakianakis, A., Douligeris, C., Marinos, L., Lourenço, M., Raghimi, O., (2019) Enisa Threat Landscape Report 2018: 15 Top Cyberthreats and Trends, , https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisathreat-landscape-report-2018; Satter, R., (2020) Experts Who Wrestled with Solarwinds Hackers Say Cleanup Could Take Months - Or Longer, , https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-cyberusa-solarwinds-idUSKBN28Y1K3, 12-24 [Online]; Sirota, S., Air force response to solarwinds hack: Preserve commercial partnerships, improve transparency into security efforts (2021) Inside Cybersecurity, , https://search-proquestcom.ezproxy.uwe.ac.uk/trade-journals/air-force-response-solarwindshack-preserve/docview/2477182241/se-2?accountid=14785, Jan 12, name - Department of Defense; Copyright - Copyright Inside Washington Publishers Jan 12, 2021; Last updated - 2021-01-13.

Now different types of intrusion traffic in the real network environment are imbalanced, which lead to poor recognition rate of classification models when dealing with rare attack types with few training samples. In order to solve the above problems, a new VAE-GAN model is proposed by combining VAE with GAN and optimizing the loss function to generate high-quality intrusion samples more efficiently and stably. In the training phase, original samples and generated samples are mixed as the input of classifiers. The experimental results show that the proposed VAE-GAN model has stronger stability and faster model convergence speed in the process of generating data. For small-sample data, the Recall and F1-score are significantly improved by using the generated samples of VAE-GAN model as the training set of classifiers. © 2021 IEEE.","Deep learning; Generative Adversarial Network; Intrusion detection; samples class imbalance; Variational Auto-Encoder","Big data; Classification (of information); Network security; Adversarial networks; Classification models; Intrusion detection method; Intrusion detection technologies; Model convergence; Security research; Small sample datum; Training sample; Intrusion detection","Negi, A., Saini, H., An overview of intrusion detection system in computer networks (2014) International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering (IJITEE), 4, pp. 90-92; Salam, A.M., Akram, Z.A.K., Salwani, A., Efendy, M.S.M.F., An analysis of the KDD99 and UNSW-NB15 datasets for the intrusion detection system (2020) Symmetry, 12, p. 1666; Goodfellow, I.J., Pouget-Abadie, J., Mirza, M., Generative adversarial nets (2014) Proc.

In order to ensure the security of the network, Intrusion Detection system (IDS) has become very important. However, when met with the adversarial examples, IDS has itself become no longer secure, and the attackers can increase the success rate of attacks by misleading IDS. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the robustness of the IDS. In this paper, we employ Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) to generate adversarial examples to test the robustness of three intrusion detection models based on convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU). We employ three training methods: the first is to train the models with normal examples, the second is to train the models directly with adversarial examples, and the last is to pretrain the models with normal examples, and then employ adversarial examples to train the models. We evaluate the performance of the three models under different training methods, and find that under normal training method, CNN is the most robust model to adversarial examples. After adversarial training, the robustness of GRU and LSTM to adversarial examples has greatly been improved. © 2021, Institut Mines-Télécom and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adversarial examples; Adversary training; CNN; FGSM; GRU; LSTM","Computer crime; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Network security; Internet of thing (IOT); Intrusion detection models; Intrusion Detection Systems; Network attack; Robust modeling; Three models; Training methods; Long short-term memory","Elrawy, M.F., Awad, A.I., Hamed, H.F.A., Intrusion detection systems for IoT-based smart environments: a survey (2018) J Cloud Comput, 7, pp. 1-20; Weber, M., Boban, M., Security challenges of the Internet of Things (2016) 2016 39th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO), pp. 638-643. , (,),.

In this paper, we present an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) specially designed for the SG environments that use Modbus/Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Distributed Network Protocol 3 (DNP3) protocols. The proposed IDS called MENSA (anoMaly dEtection aNd claSsificAtion) adopts a novel Autoencoder-Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture for (a) detecting operational anomalies and (b) classifying Modbus/TCP and DNP3 cyberattacks. In particular, MENSA combines the aforementioned Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in a common architecture, taking into account the adversarial loss and the reconstruction difference. The proposed IDS is validated in four real SG evaluation environments, namely (a) SG lab, (b) substation, (c) hydropower plant and (d) power plant, solving successfully an outlier detection (i.e., anomaly detection) problem as well as a challenging multiclass classification problem consisting of 14 classes (13 Modbus/TCP cyberattacks and normal instances). Furthermore, MENSA can discriminate five cyberattacks against DNP3. The evaluation results demonstrate the efficiency of MENSA compared to other Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods in terms of Accuracy, False Positive Rate (FPR), True Positive Rate (TPR) and the F1 score. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Anomaly detection; auto-encoder; cybersecurity; deep learning; generative adversarial network; machine learning; modbus; smart grid","Anomaly detection; Deep neural networks; Electric power transmission networks; Hydroelectric power plants; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Network architecture; Network protocols; Network security; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Privacy by design; Smart power grids; Adversarial networks; Classification approach; Common architecture; Distributed network protocols; False positive rates; Intrusion Detection Systems; Multiclass classification problems; True positive rates; Deep learning","Tan, S., De, D., Song, W.-Z., Yang, J., Das, S.K., Survey of security advances in smart grid: A data driven approach (2017) Ieee Commun.

However, in real-world scenarios, data is often insufficient (few-shot), which leads to various deviations between the models prediction and the ground truth. Consequently, downstream tasks such as unknown attack detection based on few-shot will be limited by insufficient data. In this paper, we propose a novel unknown attack detection method based on Intra Categories Generation in Embedding Space, namely SFE-GACN, which might be the solution of few-shot problem. Concretely, we first propose Session Feature Embedding (SFE) to summarize the context of basic granularity of network traffic: sessions, bring the insufficient data to the pre-trained embedding space. In this way, we achieve the goal of preliminary information extension in the few-shot case. Second, we further propose the Generative Adversarial Cooperative Network (GACN), which improves the conventional Generative Adversarial Network by supervising the generated sample to avoid falling into similar categories, and thus enables samples to generate intra categories. Our proposed SFE-GACN achieved that it can accurately generate session samples in the case of few-shot, and ensure the difference between categories during data augmentation. The detection results show that compared to the state-of-the-art method, the average TPR is 8.38% higher, and the average FPR is 12.77% lower. In addition, we evaluated the graphics generation capabilities of GACN on the graphics dataset, the result shows our proposed GACN can be popularized for generating easy-confused multi-categories graphics. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Few-shot; Generative adversarial cooperative network (GACN); Intra categories generation; Session feature embedding; Unknown attack detection","Deep learning; Intrusion detection; Attack detection; Cooperative networks; Embeddings; Feature embedding; Few-shot; Generative adversarial cooperative network; Intra category generation; Session feature embedding; Unknown attack detection; Unknown attacks; Embeddings","Annadani, Y., Biswas, S., Preserving semantic relations for zero-shot learning (2018) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR); Bamler, R., Mandt, S., Dynamic word embeddings (2017) Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, 70, pp. 380-389. , International Convention Centre Sydney, Australia; Goodfellow, I., Pouget-Abadie, J., Mirza, M., Xu, B., Warde-Farley, D., Ozair, S., Courville, A., Bengio, Y., Generative adversarial nets (2014) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2672-2680. , Curran Associates, Inc; Hu, H., Tan, T., Qian, Y., Generative adversarial networks based data augmentation for noise robust speech recognition (2018) 2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 5044-5048; Kodirov, E., Xiang, T., Gong, S., Semantic autoencoder for zero-shot learning (2017) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR); Morgado, P., Vasconcelos, N., Semantically consistent regularization for zero-shot recognition (2017) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR); Patrick, D., Christian, G., Ulrich, F., Sven, D., Michael, M., Detecting zero-day attacks using context-aware anomaly detection at the application-layer (2017) Int.

This article introduces the concept of covert attacks on autonomous vehicles which can jeopardize the safety of passengers. Covert attacks are designed to manipulate outputs of cyber physical systems through network channels in a way that while the changes are not easily perceptible by human beings, systems are negatively affected in the long run. We argue that future smart vehicles are vulnerable to viruses which can use adversarial learning methods to adapt themselves to hosts and remain stealth for a long period. As a case study, we design a covert attack on the lane keeping system of autonomous vehicles. In the scenario, an intelligent adversary manipulates sensor readings (lane position, curvature, etc.) in order to deceive the controller to drive the vehicle closer to the boundaries. The virus/attacker interactively learns the host vehicle behaviors in terms of lateral deviation and maneuverability and tries to increase the errors to the extent that remains unnoticeable to the driver. This process is carried out through actor-critic learning based on the Newton - Raphson method. We additionally design an intrusion detection system for such covert attacks. We use the GPS data and offline maps to reconstruct road curves and match them against readings. A simulation testbed is developed based on the map of Nurburgring-Grand Prix track to evaluate our models. Results confirm the validity and effectiveness of the proposed models. © 1996-2012 IEEE.","Adversarial machine learning; covert attack; cyber-physical systems (CPSs); fault diagnosis and prognosis; intelligent control; Internet of Things (IoT) in industry; lane keeping (LK); security; unmanned autonomous systems; vehicle safety","Artificial intelligence; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Global positioning system; Highway planning; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Maneuverability; Newton-Raphson method; Roads and streets; Actor-critic learning; Adversarial learning; Developed model; Intrusion Detection Systems; Lateral deviation; Road management systems; Sensor readings; Simulation test beds; Autonomous vehicles","Dong, C., Dolan, J.M., Litkouhi, B., Smooth behavioral estimation for ramp merging control in autonomous driving (2018) Proc.

It starts with an introduction of Industry 4.0 concept and an understanding of AI use in this context. Then provides elements of security principles and detection techniques applied to operational technology (OT) which forms the main attack surface of manufacturing systems. As some intrusion detection systems (IDS) already involve some AI-based techniques, we focus on existing machine-learning and data-mining based techniques in use for intrusion detection. This article presents the major strengths and weaknesses of the main techniques in use. We also discuss an assessment of their relevance for application to OT, from the manufacturer point of view. Another part of the paper introduces the essential drivers and principles of Industry 4.0, providing insights on the advent of AI in manufacturing systems as well as an understanding of the new set of challenges it implies. AI-based techniques for production monitoring, optimisation and control are proposed with insights on several application cases. The related technical, operational and security challenges are discussed and an understanding of the impact of such transition on current security practices is then provided in more details. The final part of the report further develops a vision of security challenges for Industry 4.0. It addresses aspects of orchestration of distributed detection techniques, introduces an approach to adversarial/robust AI development and concludes with human–machine behaviour monitoring requirements. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence; Industry 4.0; Intrusion detection systems; Security","Data mining; Industry 4.0; Intrusion detection; Network security; Artificial intelligence technologies; Behaviour monitoring; Distributed detection; Intrusion Detection Systems; Manufacturing sector; Operational technologies; Production monitoring; Security principles; Artificial intelligence","Adadi, A., Berrada, M., Peeking inside the black-box: a survey on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 52138-52160; Aickelin, U., Greensmith, J., Kim, J., Bentleytedesco, P.J., Immune system approaches to intrusion detection—a review (2007) Nat Comput, pp. 413-466; Althubiti, S.A., Jones, E.M., Roy, K., LSTM for anomaly-based network intrusion detection.

Although most applications encrypt their network traffic and some of them dynamically change their port numbers, Machine Learning (ML) and especially Deep Learning (DL)-based classifiers have shown impressive performance in network traffic classification. In this article, we evaluate the robustness of DL-based network traffic classifiers against Adversarial Network Traffic (ANT). ANT causes DL-based network traffic classifiers to predict incorrectly using Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) generating methods. Since there is no need to buffer network traffic before sending ANT, it is generated live. We partition the input space of the DL-based network traffic classification into three categories: packet classification, flow content classification, and flow time series classification. To generate ANT, we propose three new attacks injecting UAP into network traffic. AdvPad attack injects a UAP into the content of packets to evaluate the robustness of packet classifiers. AdvPay attack injects a UAP into the payload of a dummy packet to evaluate the robustness of flow content classifiers. AdvBurst attack injects a specific number of dummy packets with crafted statistical features based on a UAP into a selected burst of a flow to evaluate the robustness of flow time series classifiers. The results indicate injecting a little UAP into network traffic, highly decreases the performance of DL-based network traffic classifiers in all categories. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","adversarial example; adversarial machine learning; adversarial network traffic; deep learning; Network traffic classification","Classifiers; Intrusion detection; Time series; Adversarial networks; Content classification; Generating methods; Intrusion Detection Systems; Network traffic classification; Network traffic management; Packet classification; Statistical features; Deep learning","Pacheco, F., Exposito, E., Gineste, M., Baudoin, C., Aguilar, J., Towards the deployment of machine learning solutions in network traffic classification: A systematic survey (2019) Ieee Commun.

The smart home in the era of the IoE is born on the basis of the high integration of emerging communication technologies such as big data, sensors, and machine learning. In this paper, we focus on wireless detection technologies using smartphones and computers in smart homes. Among them, the indoor Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) personnel intrusion detection technology based on the database construction has become one of the comprehensive detection technologies by advantages of the convenient accessibility of the WLAN signal and minimal hardware requirement. However, the considerable labor and time cost involved in the database construction affects the popularity and application of database-based intrusion detection systems. To cope with this problem, we propose a new indoor WLAN personnel intrusion detection approach with the reduced overhead of the database construction. Specifically, first of all, the offline database is extended by fake Received Signal Strength (RSS) data, which are generated by the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based supervised learning from actual labeled RSS data. Second, the difference between the extended database and online RSS data caused by the time-variant environment noise is reduced by minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between marginal distributions of RSS data through the transfer learning. Finally, the intrusion detection is achieved by classifying online RSS data with classifiers trained from the extended database. Furthermore, experimental results show that the proposed approach can not only perform well in reducing the database overhead and the difference of data in source and target domains, which are corresponding to the same environment state but also detect environment states with satisfactory accuracy. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Database extension; Generative adversarial network; Personnel intrusion detection; Transfer learning; Wireless local area network","Ambient intelligence; Automation; Classification (of information); Cost reduction; Distributed database systems; Engineering education; Intelligent buildings; Personnel; Transfer learning; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Communication technologies; Database construction; Intrusion detection approaches; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion detection technologies; Marginal distribution; Network infrastructure; Received signal strength; Intrusion detection","Ullah, F., Intelligence and security in big 5G-oriented IoNT: an overview (2020) Futur Gener Comput Syst, 102 (1), pp. 357-368; Alabady, S.A., Fadi, A.T., Sadia, D., A novel security model for cooperative virtual networks in the IoT era (2018) Int J Parallel Prog, 48, pp. 280-295; Al-Turjman, F., Smart-cities medium access for smart mobility applications in IoT (2019) Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies Article Number; Yang, Z., Zhou, Z., Liu, Y., From RSSI to CSI: indoor localization via channel response (2013) ACM Comput Surv, 46 (2), pp. 1-32; Poongodi, M., Vijayakumar, V., Al-Turjman, F., Hamdi, M., Ma, M., Intrusion prevention system for DDoS attack on VANET with reCAPTCHA controller using information based metrics (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 158481-158491; Guan, L., Hu, F., Al-Turjman, F., Khan, M.B., Yang, X., A non-contact paraparesis detection technique based on 1D-CNN (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 182280-182288; Ullah, F., Naeem, H., Jabber, S., Khalid, S., Latif, M.A., Al-turjman, F., Cyber security threats detection in internet of things using deep learning approach (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 124379-124389; Al-Urjman, F., Zahmatkesh, H., Shahroze, R., Article number: E3677) An overview of security and privacy in smart cities IoT communications (2019) Trans Emerg Telecommun Technol, , https://doi.org/10.1002/ett.3677; Chowdhury, S.A., Uddin, M.N., Kowsar, M.M.S., Deb, K., Occlusion handling and human detection based on histogram of oriented gradients for automatic video surveillance (2016) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Innovations in Science, Eng Technol, pp. 1-4. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ICISET.2016.7856523; Sahoo, K.C., Pati, U.C., IoT based intrusion detection system using PIR sensor (2017) Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Recent Trends in Electronics.

As ML techniques are becoming a popular solution for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) applications in research literatures, the security of these applications is of concern. However, current studies on adversarial machine learning (AML) mainly focus on pure cyberspace domains. The risks the adversarial examples can bring to the CPS applications have not been well investigated. In particular, due to the distributed property of data sources and the inherent physical constraints imposed by CPSs, the widely-used threat models and the state-of-the-art AML algorithms in previous cyberspace research become infeasible. We study the potential vulnerabilities of ML applied in CPSs by proposing Constrained Adversarial Machine Learning (ConAML), which generates adversarial examples that satisfy the intrinsic constraints of the physical systems. We first summarize the difference between AML in CPSs and AML in existing cyberspace systems and propose a general threat model for ConAML. We then design a best-effort search algorithm to iteratively generate adversarial examples with linear physical constraints. We evaluate our algorithms with simulations of two typical CPSs, the power grids and the water treatment system. The results show that our ConAML algorithms can effectively generate adversarial examples which significantly decrease the performance of the ML models even under practical constraints. © 2021 ACM.","adversarial machine learning;

However, it has been found that deep learning models are vulnerable to data instances that can mislead the model to make incorrect classification decisions socalled adversarial examples. Such vulnerability allows attackers to target NIDSs in a black-box setting by adding small crafty perturbations to the malicious traffic to evade detection and disrupt the system's critical functionalities. Yet, little researches have addressed the risks of black-box adversarial attacks against NIDS and proposed mitigation solutions. This survey explores this research problem and identifies open issues and certain areas that demand further research for considerable impacts. © 2021 IEEE.","Adversarial Attacks; Adversarial Examples; Adversarial Machine Learning; Black-box Attacks; Deep Neural Networks; Network Intrusion Detection; Network Security","Computer crime; Deep learning; Internet of things; Learning systems; Surveys; Classification decision; Detection rates; Feature engineerings; Learning techniques; Malicious traffic; Network intrusion detection; Network intrusion detection systems; Research problems; Intrusion detection","Buczak, A.L., Guven, E., A survey of data mining and machine learning methods for cyber security intrusion detection (2015) Ieee Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 18 (2), pp. 1153-1176; Mishra, P., Varadharajan, V., Tupakula, U., Pilli, E.S., A detailed investigation and analysis of using machine learning techniques for intrusion detection (2018) Ieee Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 21 (1), pp. 686-728; Shone, N., Ngoc, T.N., Phai, V.D., Shi, Q., A deep learning approach to network intrusion detection (2018) Ieee Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence, 2 (1), pp. 41-50; Huang, L., Joseph, A.D., Nelson, B., Rubinstein, B.I., Tygar, J.D., Adversarial machine learning (2011) Proceedings of the 4th Acm Workshop on Security and Artificial Intelligence, pp. 43-58; Szegedy, C., Zaremba, W., Sutskever, I., Bruna, J., Erhan, D., Goodfellow, I., Fergus, R., (2013) Intriguing Properties of Neural Networks, , arXiv preprint; Zhang, C., Costa-Pérez, X., Patras, P., Tiki-taka: Attacking and defending deep learning-based intrusion detection systems (2020) Proceedings of the 2020 Acm Sigsac Conference on Cloud Computing Security Workshop, pp. 27-39; Ibitoye, O., Abou-Khamis, R., Matrawy, A., Shafiq, M.O., (2019) The Threat of Adversarial Attacks on Machine Learning in Network Security-A Survey, , arXiv preprint; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Jha, S., Fredrikson, M., Celik, Z.B., Swami, A., The limitations of deep learning in adversarial settings (2016) 2016 Ieee European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P), pp. 372-387. , ieee; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Goodfellow, I., (2016) Transferability in Machine Learning: From Phenomena to Black-Box Attacks Using Adversarial Samples, , arXiv preprint; Usama, M., Asim, M., Latif, S., Qadir, J., Generative adversarial networks for launching and thwarting adversarial attacks on network intrusion detection systems (2019) 2019 15th International Wireless Communications & Mobile Computing Conference IWCMC, pp. 78-83. , ieee; Lin, Z., Shi, Y., Xue, Z., (2018) Idsgan: Generative Adversarial Networks for Attack Generation against Intrusion Detection, , arXiv preprint; Li, P., Zhao, W., Liu, Q., Liu, X., Yu, L., Poisoning machine learning based wireless idss via stealing learning model (2019) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 10874 Lncs, No, 2018, pp. 261-273. , December; Kuppa, A., Grzonkowski, S., Asghar, M.R., Le-Khac, N.-A., Black box attacks on deep anomaly detectors (2019) Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security, pp. 1-10; Schlegl, T., Seeböck, P., Waldstein, S.M., Schmidt-Erfurth, U., Langs, G., Unsupervised anomaly detection with generative adversarial networks to guide marker discovery (2017) International Conference on Information Processing in Medical Imaging, pp. 146-157. , Springer; Zenati, H., Romain, M., Foo, C.-S., Lecouat, B., Chandrasekhar, V., Adversarially learned anomaly detection (2018) 2018 Ieee International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM), pp. 727-736. , ieee; Ruff, L., Vandermeulen, R., Goernitz, N., Deecke, L., Siddiqui, S.A., Binder, A., Müller, E., Kloft, M., Deep one-class classification (2018) International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 4393-4402; Yan, Q., Wang, M., Huang, W., Luo, X., Yu, F.R., Automatically synthesizing dos attack traces using generative adversarial networks (2019) International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics, 10 (12), pp. 3387-3396. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13042-019-00925-6, [Online]; Peng, X., Huang, W., Shi, Z., Adversarial attack against dos intrusion detection: An improved boundary-based method (2019) 2019 Ieee 31st International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI), pp. 1288-1295; Usama, M., Qayyum, A., Qadir, J., Al-Fuqaha, A., Black-box adversarial machine learning attack on network traffic classification (2019) 2019 15th International Wireless Communications & Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC, pp. 84-89; Aiken, J., Scott-Hayward, S., Investigating adversarial attacks against network intrusion detection systems in sdns (2019) 2019 Ieee Conference on Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Networks (NFV-SDN).

Cyber agility has become a critical proactive security resource that makes it possible to measure defense adjustments and reactions to rising threats. Subsequently, machine learning has been applied to support cyber agility prediction as an essential effort to anticipate future security performance. Nevertheless, apt and treacherous actors motivated by economic incentives continue to prevail in circumventing machine learning-based protection tools. Adversarial learning, widely applied to computer security, especially intrusion detection, has emerged as a new area of concern for the recently recognized critical cyber agility prediction. The rationale is, if a sophisticated malicious actor obtains the cyber agility parameters, correct prediction cannot be guaranteed. Unless with a demonstration of white-box attack failures.The challenge lies in recognizing that unconstrained adversaries hold vast potential capabilities. In practice, they could have perfect-knowledge, i.e., a full understanding of the defense tool in use. We address this challenge by proposing an adversarial machine learning approach that achieves accurate cyber agility forecast through mapped nefarious influence on static defense tools metrics. Considering an adversary would aim at influencing perilous confidence in a defense tool, we demonstrate resilient cyber agility prediction through verified attack signatures in dynamic learning windows. After that, we compare cyber agility prediction under negative influence with and without our proposed dynamic learning windows. Our numerical results show the model's execution degrades without adversarial machine learning. Such a feigned measure of performance could lead to incorrect software security patching. © 2021 IEEE.","Adversarial machine learning; Cyber agility; Predictive analytics","Forecasting; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Adversarial learning; Economic incentive; Machine learning approaches; Measure of performance; Potential capability; Proactive security; Security performance; Software security; Network security","Huang, K., Siegel, M., Madnick, S., Systematically understanding the cyber attack business: A survey (2018) ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 51 (4), pp. 1-36; Colbaugh, R., Glass, K., Predictive defense against evolving adversaries (2012) 2012 IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics.

Yet one of the biggest challenges is that ML-based IDSs suffer from adversarial example (AE) attacks. By applying small perturbations (e.g. slightly increasing packet inter-arrival time) to the intrusion traffic, an AE attack can flip the prediction of a well-trained IDS. We address this challenge by proposing MANDA, a MANifold and Decision boundary-based AE detection system. Through analyzing AE attacks, we notice that 1) an AE tends to be close to its original manifold (i.e., the cluster of samples in its original class) regardless which class it is misclassified into; and 2) AEs tend to be close to the decision boundary so as to minimize the perturbation scale. Based on the two observations, we design MANDA for accurate AE detection by exploiting inconsistency between manifold evaluation and IDS model inference and evaluating model uncertainty on small perturbations. We evaluate MANDA on NSL-KDD under three state-of-the-art AE attacks. Our experimental results show that MANDA achieves as high as 98.41% true-positive rate with 5% false-positive rate and can be applied to other problem spaces such as image recognition. © 2021 IEEE.",,"Computer crime; Image recognition; Network security; Uncertainty analysis; Decision boundary; Evaluating models; False positive rates; Inter-arrival time; Intrusion Detection Systems; Network intrusion detection systems; Small perturbations; True positive rates; Intrusion detection","Liao, H.-J., Lin, C.-H.R., Intrusion detection system: A comprehensive review (2013) Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 36 (1), pp. 16-24; McHugh, J., Testing intrusion detection systems: A critique of the 1998 and 1999 DARPA intrusion detection system evaluations as performed by lincoln laboratory (2000) ACM Trans.

However, the introduction of such IDSs has also created an additional attack vector; the learning models may also be subject to cyber attacks, otherwise referred to as Adversarial Machine Learning (AML). Such attacks may have severe consequences in ICS systems, as adversaries could potentially bypass the IDS. This could lead to delayed attack detection which may result in infrastructure damages, financial loss, and even loss of life. This paper explores how adversarial learning can be used to target supervised models by generating adversarial samples using the Jacobian-based Saliency Map attack and exploring classification behaviours. The analysis also includes the exploration of how such samples can support the robustness of supervised models using adversarial training. An authentic power system dataset was used to support the experiments presented herein. Overall, the classification performance of two widely used classifiers, Random Forest and J48, decreased by 6 and 11 percentage points when adversarial samples were present. Their performances improved following adversarial training, demonstrating their robustness towards such attacks. © 2021","Adversarial Machine Learning; Attack detection; Industrial Control Systems; Intrusion Detection System; Supervised machine learning","Chemical detection; Crime; Damage detection; Decision trees; Intrusion detection; Losses; Machine learning; Network security; Robustness (control systems); Adversarial learning; Attack detection; Automated detection; Classification performance; Industrial control systems; Intrusion Detection Systems; Learning models; Percentage points; Computer crime","Kravchik, M., Shabtai, A., Detecting cyber attacks in industrial control systems using convolutional neural networks (2018) 2018 workshop on cyber-physical systems security and privacy, pp. 72-83. , ACM; Ashibani, Y., Mahmoud, Q.H., Cyber physical systems security: Analysis, challenges and solutions (2017) Comput Secur, 68, pp. 81-97; Erba, A., Taormina, R., Galelli, S., Pogliani, M., Carminati, M., Zanero, S., Real-time evasion attacks with physical constraints on deep learning-based anomaly detectors in industrial control systems (2019), arXiv preprint; Beaver, J.M., Borges-Hink, R.C., Buckner, M.A., An evaluation of machine learning methods to detect malicious scada communications (2013) 2013 12th international conference on machine learning and applications, vol. 2, pp. 54-59. , IEEE; Bigham, J., Gamez, D., Lu, N., Safeguarding SCADA systems with anomaly detection (2003) International workshop on mathematical methods, models, and architectures for computer network security, pp. 171-182. , Springer; Teixeira, M.A., Salman, T., Zolanvari, M., Jain, R., Meskin, N., Samaka, M., SCADA system testbed for cybersecurity research using machine learning approach (2018) Future Internet, 10 (8), p. 76; Strauss, T., Hanselmann, M., Junginger, A., Ulmer, H., Ensemble methods as a defense to adversarial perturbations against deep neural networks (2017), arXiv preprint; Goh, J., Adepu, S., Tan, M., Lee, Z.S., Anomaly detection in cyber physical systems using recurrent neural networks (2017) 2017 IEEE 18th international symposium on high assurance systems engineering, pp. 140-145. , IEEE; Maglaras, L.A., Jiang, J., Intrusion detection in SCADA systems using machine learning techniques (2014) 2014 science and information conference, pp. 626-631. , IEEE; Linda, O., Vollmer, T., Manic, M., Neural network based intrusion detection system for critical infrastructures (2009) 2009 International joint conference on neural networks, pp. 1827-1834. , IEEE; Rigaki, M., Adversarial deep learning against intrusion detection classifiers (2017); Biggio, B., Fumera, G., Roli, F., Multiple classifier systems under attack (2010) International workshop on multiple classifier systems, pp. 74-83. , Springer; Huang, L., Joseph, A.D., Nelson, B., Rubinstein, B.I., Tygar, J.D., Adversarial machine learning (2011) Proceedings of the 4th ACM workshop on security and artificial intelligence, pp. 43-58. , ACM; Nelson, B., Barreno, M., Chi, F.J., Joseph, A.D., Rubinstein, B.I., Saini, U., Exploiting machine learning to subvert your spam filter (2008) LEET, 8, pp. 1-9; Zhou, Y., Kantarcioglu, M., Thuraisingham, B., Xi, B., Adversarial support vector machine learning.

Machine learning algorithms have been proposed for hindering cyber-attacks on CPSs, but the absence of labeled data from novel attacks makes their detection quite challenging. In this context, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a promising unsupervised approach to detect cyber-attacks by implicitly modeling the system. However, the detection of cyber-attacks on CPSs has strict latency requirements, since the attacks need to be stopped before the system is compromised. In this article, we propose FID-GAN, a novel fog-based, unsupervised intrusion detection system (IDS) for CPSs using GANs. The IDS is proposed for a fog architecture, which brings computation resources closer to the end nodes and thus contributes to meeting low-latency requirements. In order to achieve higher detection rates, the proposed architecture computes a reconstruction loss based on the reconstruction of data samples mapped to the latent space. Other works that follow a similar approach struggle with the time required to compute the reconstruction loss, which renders them impractical for latency constrained applications. We address this problem by training an encoder that accelerates the reconstruction loss computation. Experiments show that the proposed solution achieves higher detection rates and is at least 5.5 times faster than a baseline approach in the three studied data sets. © 2014 IEEE.","Cyber-physical systems (CPSs); generative adversarial networks (GANs); industrial security; intrusion detection systems (IDSs); machine learning","Crime; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Fog; Fog computing; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Network architecture; Network security; Adversarial networks; Computation resources; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Detection rates; Intrusion Detection Systems; Physical objects; Proposed architectures; Unsupervised approaches; Computer crime","Ding, D., Han, Q.-L., Xiang, Y., Ge, X., Zhang, X.-M., A survey on security control and attack detection for industrial cyber-physical systems (2018) Neurocomputing, 275, pp. 1674-1683. , Jan; Alguliyev, R., Imamverdiyev, Y., Sukhostat, L., Cyber-physical systems and their security issues (2018) Comput.

In a dynamic environment such as the Internet of Things (IoT), which is vulnerable to various types of attacks, fast and robust solutions are in demand to handle fast-changing threats and thus the ever-increasing difficulty of detection. In this paper, we present a novel framework for the detection of anomalies, which, in particular, supports intrusion detection. The anomaly-detection framework we propose combines reinforcement learning with class-imbalance techniques. Our goal is not only to exploit the auto-learning ability of the reinforcement-learning loop but also to address the dataset imbalance problem, which is pervasive in existing learning-based solutions. We introduce an adapted SMOTE to address the class-imbalance problem while remodelling the behaviors of the environment agent for better performance. Experiments are conducted on NSL-KDD datasets. Comparative evaluations and their results are presented and analyzed. Using techniques such as SMOTE, ROS, NearMiss1 and NearMiss2, performance measures obtained from our simulations have led us to recognize specific performance trends. In particular, the proposed model AESMOTE outperforms AE-RL in several cases. Experiment results show an Accuracy greater than 0.82 and a F1 greater than 0.824. © 2013 IEEE.","adversarial strategy; anomaly detection; class-imbalance; deep reinforcement learning; dynamic training; feature-selection","Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Reinforcement learning; Anomaly detection frameworks; Class imbalance problems; Comparative evaluations; Data-centric networks; Dynamic environments; Internet of thing (IOT); Intrusion Detection Systems; Performance measure; Anomaly detection","Fernandes, G., Rodrigues, J., Carvalho, L., Al-Muhtadi, J., Proenca, M., A comprehensive survey on network anomaly detection (2019) Telecommun.

Remote attacks on the SAE J1939 protocol based on controller access network (CAN) bus for heavy-duty ground vehicles can lead to detectable changes in the physical characteristics of the vehicle. In this paper, I develop an unsupervised learning approach to monitor the normal behavior within the CAN bus data and detect malicious traffic. The J1939 data packets have some text-based features that I convert to numerical values. In addition, I propose an algorithm based on hierarchical agglomerative clustering that considers multiple approaches for linkages and pairwise distances between observations. I present prediction performance results to show the effectiveness of this ensemble algorithm. In addition to in-vehicle network security, this algorithm is also transferrable to other cybersecurity datasets, including botnet attacks in traditional enterprise IP networks. © 2021 IEEE.","Cybersecurity; Hierarchical clustering; In-vehicle networks; Unsupervised learning","Access control; Clustering algorithms; Ground vehicles; Hierarchical clustering; Intrusion detection; Network security; Unsupervised learning; Ensemble algorithms; Hierarchical agglomerative clustering; In-vehicle network securities; In-vehicle networks; Pairwise distances; Physical characteristics; Prediction performance; Text-based features; Internet protocols","Koscher, K., Savage, S., Roesner, F., Patel, S., Kohno, T., Czeskis, A., Checkoway, S., Experimental security analysis of a modern automobile (2010) 2010 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 447-462; Checkoway, S., McCoy, D., Kantor, B., Anderson, D., Shacham, H., Savage, S., Koscher, K., Kohno, T., Comprehensive experimental analyses of automotive attack surfaces (2011) USENIX Security Symposium, 4, pp. 447-462; Lokman, S.F., Othman, A.T., Abu-Bakar, M.H., Intrusion detection system for automotive Controller Area Network (CAN) bus system: A review (2019) EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking, 2019 (1); Chandola, V., Banerjee, A., Kumar, V., Anomaly detection: A survey (2009) ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR) 41, (3), pp. 1-58; Al-Jarrah, O.Y., Maple, C., Dianati, M., Oxtoby, D., Mouzakitis, A., Intrusion detection systems for intra-vehicle networks: A review (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 21266-21289; Young, C., Svoboda, J., Zambreno, J., Towards reverse engineering controller area network messages using machine learning (2020) IEEE WFIoT IEEE; Weber, M., Klug, S., Sax, E., Zimmer, B., Embedded hybrid anomaly detection for automotive CAN communication (2018) 9th European Congress on Embedded Real Time Software and Systems (ERTS 2018); Cho, K., Shin, K.G., Fingerprinting electronic control units for vehicle intrusion detection (2016) 25th {USENIX} Security Symposium ({USENIX} Security 16), pp. 911-927; Moore, M.R., Bridges, R.A., Combs, F.L., Starr, M.S., Prowell, S.J., Modeling inter-signal arrival times for accurate detection of can bus signal injection attacks: A data-driven approach to in-vehicle intrusion detection (2017) Proceedings of the IEEE 12th Annual Conference on Cyber and Information Security Research, pp. 1-4; Taylor, A., Japkowicz, N., Leblanc, S., Frequency-based anomaly detection for the automotive CAN bus (2015) 2015 World Congress on Industrial Control Systems Security (WCICSS), IEEE; Taylor, A., Leblanc, S., Japkowicz, N., Anomaly detection in automobile control network data with long short-term memory networks (2016) 2016 IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA), pp. 130-139; Kang, M., Kang, J., Intrusion detection system using deep neural network for in-vehicle network security (2016) PloS One 11, (6); Jain, A., Dubes, R.C., Algorithms for clustering data (1988) Prentice-Hall, Inc.; Kleinberg, J., An impossibility theorem for clustering (2003) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 463-470; Pedregosa, F., Varoquaux, G., Gramfort, A., Michel, V., Thirion, B., Grisel, O., Scikit-learn: Machine learning in python (2011) The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 12, pp. 2825-2830","Leslie, N.; Raytheon TechnologiesUnited States; email: nandi.o.leslie@raytheon.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781665412681,,,"English","Annu.

Although deep neural networks demonstrate satisfactory performance regarding image and voice recognition, as well as pattern analysis and intrusion detection, they exhibit inferior performance towards adversarial examples. Noise introduction, to some degree, to the original data could lead adversarial examples to be misclassified by deep neural networks, even though they can still be deemed as normal by humans. In this paper, a robust diversity adversarial training method against adversarial attacks was demonstrated. In this approach, the target model is more robust to unknown adversarial examples, as it trains various adversarial samples. During the experiment, Tensorflow was employed as our deep learning framework, while MNIST and Fashion-MNIST were used as experimental datasets. Results revealed that the diversity training method has lowered the attack success rate by an average of 27.2 and 24.3% for various adversarial examples, while main-taining the 98.7 and 91.5% accuracy rates regarding the original data of MNIST and Fashion-MNIST. © 2021 by the authors.

Their primary objective is to gain unauthorized access to network assets, compromise system and data. APTs are stealthy and remain dormant for an extended period of time, which makes their detection challenging. In this article, we leverage machine learning (ML) to detect hosts in a network that are a target of an APT attack. We evaluate a number of ML classifiers to detect susceptible hosts in the Los Alamos National Lab dataset. We (i) scrutinize graph-based features extracted from host authentication logs, (ii) use feature engineering to reduce dimensionality, (iii) explore balancing the training dataset using over- and under-sampling techniques, (iv) evaluate numerous supervised ML techniques and their ensemble, (v) compare our classification model to the state-of-the-art approaches that leverage the same dataset, and show that our model outperforms them with respect to prediction performance and overhead, and (vi) perturb the attack patterns to study the influence of change in attack frequency and scale on classification performance, and propose a solution for such adversarial behavior. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","advanced persistent threat; adversarial learning; intrusion detection; Machine learning","Authentication; Balancing; Graphic methods; Classification models; Classification performance; Feature engineerings; Graph-based features; Host authentication; Prediction performance; State-of-the-art approach; Unauthorized access; Classification (of information)","Gatlan, S., (2019) Asus Live Update Infected with Backdoor in Supply Chain Attack., , https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/asus-liveupdate-infected-with-backdoor-in-supply-chain-attack/, Mar.

However, building a good deep learning model needs a huge amount of data that is not easily provided, especially in the applications that need sensitive information. Accordingly, researchers propose multiple methodologies for sharing the model rather than sharing the dataset itself. Nevertheless, it has been proven that the shared models still could leak a lot of sensitive information about the private data. In this work, we introduce a survey about the attacks that could be launched against the shared models and the countermeasures that could be taken to preserve the privacy of the sensitive data that is used for the training process. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Adversarial machine learning; Convolutional neural network; Deep neural network; Machine learning","Data privacy; Face recognition; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Learning models; Privacy Attacks; Private data; Sensitive datas; Sensitive informations; Shared model; Training process; Deep learning","Zheng, X., Zhou, Y., Ye, Y., Li, F., A cloud data deduplication scheme based on certificateless proxy re-encryption (2020) J.

However, an adversarial example, created by adding a little noise to an original sample, can cause misclassification by a DNN. This is a serious threat to the DNN because the added noise is not detected by the human eye. For example, if an attacker modifies a right-turn sign so that it misleads to the left, autonomous vehicles with the DNN will incorrectly classify the modified sign as pointing to the left, but a person will correctly classify the modified sign as pointing to the right. Studies are under way to defend against such adversarial examples. The existing method of defense against adversarial examples requires an additional process such as changing the classifier or modifying input data. In this paper, we propose a new method for detecting adversarial examples that does not invoke any additional process. The proposed scheme can detect adversarial examples by using a pattern feature of the classification scores of adversarial examples. We used MNIST and CIFAR10 as experimental datasets and Tensorflow as a machine learning library. The experimental results show that the proposed method can detect adversarial examples with success rates: 99.05% and 99.9% for the untargeted and targeted cases in MNIST, respectively, and 94.7% and 95.8% for the untargeted and targeted cases in CIFAR10, respectively. © 2020, The Author(s).","Adversarial example; Classification score; Deep neural network; Detection method; Evasion attack; Machine learning","Classification (of information); Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Image recognition; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Speech recognition; Turing machines; Human eye; Input datas; Misclassifications; On-machines; Original sample; Pattern analysis; Pattern features; Neural networks","Abadi, M., Barham, P., Chen, J., Chen, Z., Davis, A., Dean, J., Devin, M., Isard, M., (2016) Tensorflow: A System for Large-Scale Machine Learning in OSDI, p. 16; Towards evaluating the robustness of neural networks.

The existing detection and defense mechanisms might be suitable for simple attack environments but become ineffective when the system faces advanced attack scenarios wherein simultaneous attacks of different types are involved. This is because these mechanisms overlook the attackers' strategies in the detection system's design, ignore the system's resource constraints, and lack sufficient knowledge about the attackers' types and abilities. To address these shortcomings, we propose a repeated Bayesian Stackelberg game consisting of the following phases: risk assessment framework that identifies the VMs' risk levels, live-migration-based defense mechanism that protects services from being successful targets for attackers, machine-learning-based technique that collects malicious data from VMs using honeypots and employs one-class Support Vector Machine to learn the attackers' types distributions, and resource-Aware Bayesian Stackelberg game that provides the hypervisor with the detection load's optimal distribution over VMs that maximizes the detection of multi-Type attacks. Experiments conducted using Amazon's datacenter and Amazon Web Services honeypot data reveal that our solution maximizes the detection, minimizes the number of attacked services, and runs efficiently compared to the state-of-The-Art detection and defense strategies, namely Collabra, probabilistic migration, Stackelberg, maxmin, and fair allocation. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Adversarial artificial intelligence; data-driven optimization; game theory; honeypots; intrusion detection; machine learning; Moving Target Defense (MTD); security risk assessment","Cloud computing; Computation theory; Computer games; Game theory; Learning systems; Monitoring; Network security; Risk assessment; Support vector machines; Virtual machine; Web services; Bayes method; Data-driven optimization; Games; Honeypots; Moving target defense; Security risk assessments; Virtual machine monitors; Intrusion detection","Wahab, O.A., Bentahar, J., Otrok, H., Mourad, A., Optimal load distribution for the detection of VM-based DDoS attacks in the cloud (2017) Ieee Trans.

Firstly, the vehicle driving data is collected, the collected data are put into the Generative Adversarial Networks for data classification, and the data set after training classification is used for model training.

The model converts network traffic data into grayscale images, generates the same proportion of attack samples by generating the counter network, ensures the uniform distribution of attack samples in the training set, and introduces the gradient penalty function to improve the stability of the training model. Secondly, CNN is used to better extract sample features. In order to prevent overfitting, the nonlinear activation function Relu and Dropout method are introduced. At the same time, the convergence speed of the model is accelerated, and the detection efficiency of the model is improved. Attention is introduced to highlight the key features and to classify samples based on these key features. In this paper, the KDDCUP99 data set is used for model evaluation. Experimental results show that this algorithm (ACGANs-CNN) has stronger model training stability, higher quality of generated fake samples, and better feature extraction effect in small sample data. Its detection rate and accuracy of attack types are significantly higher than that of traditional machine learning algorithms such as SVM, KNN, RF, and other CNN models. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","ACGANs-CNN; Conditional generation adversarial network; Intrusion detection","Big data; Classification (of information); Image enhancement; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Sampling; Convergence speed; Detection efficiency; Gray-scale images; Intrusion detection method; Intrusion detection models; Nonlinear activation functions; Small sample datum; Uniform distribution; Extraction","Wang, H, Chen, H, Yang, S, An Novel Intrusion Detection System Based on Naive Bayesian Algorithm (2013) J.

We name this system as DRLDO, for deep reinforcement learning based de-obfuscator. With the inclusion of the DRLDO as a sub-component, an existing intrusion detection system could be augmented with defensive capabilities against 'zero-day' attack from obfuscated and metamorphic variants of existing malware. This gains importance, not only because there exists no system till date that use advance DRL to intelligently and automatically normalise obfuscation down even to the opcode level, but also because the DRLDO system does not mandate any changes to the existing IDS. The DRLDO system does not even mandate the IDS' classifier to be retrained with any new dataset containing obfuscated samples. Hence DRLDO could be easily retrofitted into any existing IDS deployment. We designed, developed, and conducted experiments on the system to evaluate the same against multiple-simultaneous attacks from obfuscations generated from malware samples from a standardised dataset that contain multiple generations of malware. Experimental results prove that DRLDO was able to successfully make the otherwise undetectable obfuscated variants of the malware detectable by an existing pre-trained malware classifier. The detection probability was raised well above the cut-off mark to 0.6 for the classifier to detect the obfuscated malware unambiguously. Further, the de-obfuscated variants generated by DRLDO achieved a very high correlation (of ≈ 0.99) with the base malware. This observation validates that the DRLDO system is actually learning to de-obfuscate and not exploiting a trivial trick. © 2021, DESIDOC","Adversarial artificial intelligence; De-obfuscation; Deep reinforcement learning;

This dataset includes realistic adversarial samples that are generated by leveraging two widely used Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques. These adversarial samples are proved to evade state of the art detectors based on Machine- and Deep-Learning algorithms. The initial corpus of malicious samples consists of network flows belonging to different botnet families presented in three public datasets containing real enterprise network traffic. We use these datasets to devise detectors capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance. We then train two DRL agents, based on Double Deep Q-Network and Deep Sarsa, to generate realistic adversarial samples: the goal is achieving misclassifications by performing small modifications to the initial malicious samples. These alterations involve the features that can be more realistically altered by an expert attacker, and do not compromise the underlying malicious logic of the original samples. Our dataset represents an important contribution to the cybersecurity research community as it is the first including thousands of automatically generated adversarial samples that are able to thwart state of the art classifiers with a high evasion rate. The adversarial samples are grouped by malware variant and provided in a CSV file format. Researchers can validate their defensive proposals by testing their detectors against the adversarial samples of the proposed dataset. Moreover, the analysis of these samples can pave the way to a deeper comprehension of adversarial attacks and to some sort of explainability of machine learning defensive algorithms. They can also support the definition of novel effective defensive techniques. © 2020","Adversarial attacks; Botnet; Cyber security; Deep reinforcement learning; Intrusion detection system",,"Cheng, H.-T., Koc, L., Harmsen, J., Shaked, T., Chandra, T., Aradhye, H., Anderson, G., Shah, H., Wide & deep learning for recommender systems (2016) Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Deep Learning for Recommender Systems, pp. 7-10; Garcia, S., Grill, M., Stiborek, J., Zunino, A., An empirical comparison of botnet detection methods (2014) Elsev.

Although deep learning performs more accurately than machine learning algorithms when learning large amounts of data, the performance declines significantly in the case of learning from imbalanced data. And, while there are many studies on imbalanced data, most have weaknesses that can result in data loss or overfitting. The purpose of this study is to solve data imbalance by using the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) model, which is an unsupervised learning method of deep learning which generates new virtual data similar to the existing data. It also proposed a model that would be classified as Random Forest to identify detection performance after addressing data imbalances based on a GAN. The results of the experiment showed that the performance of the model proposed in this paper was better than the model classified without addressing the imbalance of data. In addition, it was found that the performance of the model proposed in this paper was excellent when compared with other models that were previously used widely for the data imbalance problem. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Deep learning;

Classifying infrequent intrusion types such as root-to-local (R2L) and user-to-root (U2R) attacks is a reoccurring problem for IDSs. In this study, various data sampling and class balancing techniques-Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based oversampling, k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) oversampling, NearMiss-1 undersampling, and class weights-were used to resolve the severe class imbalance affecting U2R and R2L attacks in the NSL-KDD intrusion detection dataset. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were trained on the adjusted datasets, and their performances were evaluated with a multitude of classification metrics. Here, we show that using no data sampling technique (baseline), GAN-based oversampling, and NearMiss-l undersampling, all with class weights, displayed high performances in identifying R2L and U2R attacks. Of these, the baseline with class weights had the highest overall performance with an F1-score of 0.11 and 0.22 for the identification of U2R and R2L attacks, respectively. © 2021 IEEE.","Data Sampling; Generative Adversarial Networks; Internet of Things; Intrusion Detection; Machine Learning; NSL-KDD","Classification (of information); Computer crime; Intrusion detection; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Adversarial networks; Balancing techniques; Class imbalance; Internet of Things (IOT); Intrusion Detection Systems; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Network intrusions; Under-sampling; Internet of things","Cashell, B., Jackson, W., Jickling, M., Webel, B., The economic impact of cyber-attacks (2004) Congressional Research Service Documents, 2. , CRS RL32331 (Washington DC); Bourke, E., A war without bullets: Protecting civilians in the technology trenches (2017) Alb.

Therefore, many IDS proposals have been presented to protect the controller area network (CAN) in a vehicle. Some studies showed that deep neural network models could be effectively used to detect various attacks on the CAN bus. However, it is still questionable whether such an IDS is sufficiently robust against adversarial attacks that are crafted aiming to target the IDS. In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm to generate adversarial CAN attack messages for Denial-of-Service (DoS), fuzzy, and spoofing attacks to target the state-of-the-art deep learning-based IDS for CAN. The experimental results demonstrate that the state-of-the-art IDS is not effective in detecting the generated adversarial CAN attack messages. The detection rates of the IDS were significantly decreased from 99.27%, 96.40%, and 99.63% to 2.24%, 11.59%, and 0.01% for DoS, fuzzy, and spoofing attacks, respectively. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adversarial attack; Controller area network (CAN); Intrusion detection system","5G mobile communication systems; Control system synthesis; Deep neural networks; Denial-of-service attack; Genetic algorithms; Network security; Process control; Adversarial attack; Communication capabilities; Controller area network; Controller-area network; Denialof- service attacks; Intrusion Detection Systems; Network attack; Spoofing attacks; State of the art; Third party application (Apps); Intrusion detection","Checkoway, S., Comprehensive experimental analyses of automotive attack surfaces (2011) Proceedings of the USENIX Conference on Security.

However, sophisticated attackers can manipulate the IDS’ attacks samples to evade possible detection. In this paper, we present a network-based IDS and investigate the viability of generating interpretable evasion attacks against the IDS through the application of a machine learning technique and an evolutionary algorithm. We employ a genetic algorithm to generate optimal attack features for certain attack categories, which are evaluated against a decision tree-based IDS in terms of their fitness measurements. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we perform experiments based on the NSL-KDD dataset and analyze the algorithm performance. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adversarial machine learning; Evasion attacks; Genetic algorithms; Intrusion detection","Computer crime; Decision trees; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Network security; Adversarial machine learning; Evasion attack; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion-Detection; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Network based intrusion detection systems; Network intrusion detection systems; Networked systems; Tree-based; Intrusion detection","Alqahtani, H., Sarker, I.H., Kalim, A., Minhaz Hossain, S.M., Ikhlaq, S., Hossain, S.: Cyber intrusion detection using machine learning classification techniques.

In platooning, vehicles follow one another according to an agreed-upon control law that determines vehicle separation. We show that a vehicle within a platoon and under the control of a malicious actor could cause collisions or decrease the efficiency of surrounding vehicles. This paper focuses on detecting, identifying, and mitigating so-called destabilizing attacks that could cause vehicle collisions. Our approach is decentralized and requires only local sensor information for each vehicle to identify the vehicle responsible for the attack and then deploy an appropriate mitigating controller that prevents collisions. We use a Deep Learning approach (Convolutional Neural Network) with various data preprocessing techniques to detect and identify the malicious vehicle. Results indicate that even with decent noise levels in range and relative speed data, we achieve accuracy up to 96.3\%. Also, once the adversarial vehicle is localized, we derive conditions for controller gains using the Routh Hurwitz criterion to mitigate the attack and ensure the stability of the platoon. Realistic simulator CARLA and MATLAB simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.

A novel anomaly detection solution that takes both data-level and algorithm-level approaches into account to cope with the class-imbalance problem is proposed. This solution integrates the auto-learning ability of Reinforcement Learning with the oversampling ability of a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN). To further investigate the potential of a CGAN, in imbalanced classification tasks, the effect of CGAN-based oversampling on the following classifiers is examined: Naïve Bayes, Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest and Logistic Regression. Through the experimental results, the authors demonstrate improved performance from the proposed approach, and from CGAN-based oversampling in general, over other oversampling techniques such as Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique and Adaptive Synthetic. © 2021 The Authors.

Deep learning (DL) has achieved success in network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) for IoT. Its capability of automatically extracting high-dimensional features from data and finding the association between data make it easy to identify abnormal activity from network traffic. However, DL method requires a large amount of labeled data, which is very time-consuming and expensive. Due to the privacy of IoT data, it is hard to collect enough data to train models. Also, the heterogeneity of IoT makes the NID model trained from the data collected from one IoT unable to be directly applied to another one. To address the problem, domain adaptation (DA) has been used by transferring the knowledge from the domain with huge amounts of labeled data to the domain with less or unlabeled data. However, previous DA methods generally assume the same label spaces between source and target domain, which is not feasible in a complex real environment of IoT. In this paper, we propose a NID framework using a weighted adversarial nets-based partial domain adaptation method to address this problem of inconsistent label spaces by mapping two domains to a domain-invariant feature space. The proposal can train a highly accurate NID model through the knowledge transfer from the abundant public labeled dataset of the traditional Internet to the unlabeled dataset of IoT. In addition, the proposed scheme can detect unknown attacks in the IoT with the help of knowledge from the traditional Internet. Moreover, the proposed scheme is an online NID detection which is more suitable for real IoT application. The experiments results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can achieve a good performance to detect attacks. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Intrusion detection; IoT; Partial domain adaptation","Deep learning; Internet of things; Knowledge management; Adaptation methods; Detection framework; Domain adaptation; In networks; Intrusion-Detection; Label space; Labeled data; Network intrusion detection systems; Partial domain adaptation; Security problems; Intrusion detection","Gubbi, J., Buyya, R., Marusic, S., Palaniswami, M., Internet of Things (IoT): A vision, architectural elements, and future directions (2013) Futur.

We use machine learning models as detection tools of intrusion detection systems and consider cyber attacks against node computers as well as adversarial attacks against machine learning models. We pay our attention to two problems. The first problem is when the network is attacked, how we can observe the states of the network and estimate its equilibrium with a lower cost. We apply an event-based observation and estimation method combined with machine learning-based intrusion detection systems. The second problem is to control the cost and the convergence speed of cybersecurity dynamics when it is under attack. An event-based control method and machine learning-based intrusion detection systems are put into use in this scenario. We simulate both scenarios and analyze the dynamics’ behaviors under an adversarial attack against the machine learning models on intrusion detection systems. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cybersecurity dynamics; Intrusion detection systems; Machine learning","Computer crime; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Dynamics; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Network security; Cyber security; Cybersecurity dynamic; Detection tools; Dynamics theory; Event-based; Intrusion Detection Systems; Low-costs; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Observation method; Cybersecurity","Al-Bataineh, A., White, G., Analysis and detection of malicious data exfiltration in web traffic (2012) 2012 7Th International Conference on Malicious and Unwanted Software, Pp. 26–31.

In real-world applications, the number of cyber-attack and faulty samples is usually far less than normal samples. This causes the skewed class distribution in data collected from cyber-physical systems. Training an accurate predictive model under skewed class conditions is not an easy task. In this work, we introduce a new generative adversarial framework for learning from skewed class distributions. This novel Adversarial Class-Imbalance Learning (ACIL) scheme has a novel loss function that is used during the adversarial training session. ACIL tries to iteratively adjust weights of an auxiliary multilayer perceptron to learn the minority class (i.e., cyber-attacks and physical faults) distributions along with the majority class (i.e., normal) distribution. Moreover, we devise an inclusive data-driven scheme for classifying cyber-attacks and faults, which includes four experiments of a baseline, nine state-of-the-art class-imbalance learning methods, two different generative-adversarial network-based approaches, and ACIL. These techniques are verified and compared through several experimental cyber-physical power scenarios. The obtained results show the effectiveness of ACIL for classifying samples of cyber-attacks and faults with skewed class distributions.

A huge number of new attacks are performed each day. The existing mechanisms to deal with these threats are intrusion detection system, firewall, antiviruses, etc. Nowadays, most works are based on machine learning techniques which needs huge amount of data. There are several benchmark datasets available, but most datasets are highly imbalanced in nature. Machine learning attack defense techniques which uses this type of dataset ends with ignoring the class having less instances. Also, the generation of data by performing attacks needs a deep knowledge and is time consuming. In order to get a well representative data for any attack, we have proposed a conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network.

However, due to the unbalanced nature of traffic datasets, NTC can be extremely challenging and poor management can degrade classification performance. While existing NTC methods seek to re-balance data distribution through resampling strategies, such approaches are known to suffer from information loss, overfitting, and increased model complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a new cost-sensitive deep learning approach to increase the robustness of deep learning classifiers against the imbalanced class problem in NTC. First, the dataset is divided into different partitions, and a cost matrix is created for each partition by considering the data distribution. Then, the costs are applied to the cost function layer to penalize classification errors. In our approach, costs are diverse in each type of misclassification because the cost matrix is specifically generated for each partition. To determine its utility, we implement the proposed cost-sensitive learning method in two deep learning classifiers, namely: stacked autoencoder and convolution neural networks. Our experiments on the ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset show that the proposed approach can obtain higher classification performance on low-frequency classes, in comparison to three other NTC methods.

Since the introduction of many external interfaces in modern vehicles exposes users to the risk of cyber-attacks, the need of focus on security is concrete. An IDS is a component that can detect anomalies in the behavior of the system where it is deployed. The proposed machine learning based solution is composed of two parts. The first includes a supervised trained neural network that is able to distinguish among different known attacks. The second includes a discriminator that has been trained exploiting the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) paradigm, to distinguish among the attack-free situation and an anomalous situation. It will be demonstrated how the supervised training can achieve state of the art performance in classification and how the unsupervised training can guarantee a certain level of security even without the necessity of feeding labeled data to the network. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

This protocol operates at the network layer and can create routing and optimally distribute routing information between nodes. RPL is a low-power, high-throughput IPv6 routing protocol that uses distance vectors. Each sensor-to-wire network router has a collection of fixed parents and a preferred parent on the path to the Destination-oriented directed acyclic graph (DODAG) graph's root in steady-state. Each router part of the graph sends DODAG information object (DIO) control messages and specifies its rank within the graph, indicating its position within the network relative to the root. When a node receives a DIO message, it determines its network rank, which must be higher than all its parents' rank, and then continues sending DIO messages using the trickle timer. As a result, DODAG begins at the root and eventually extends to encompass the whole network. This paper is the first review to study intrusion detection systems in the RPL protocol based on machine learning (ML) techniques to the best of our knowledge. The complexity of the new attack models identified for RPL and the efficiency of ML in intelligent and collaborative threats detection, and the issues of deploying ML in challenging LLN environments underscore the importance of research in this area.

Support vector machines (SVMs), as a kind of successful approach, were widely used to solve security problems, such as image classification, malware detection, spam filtering, and intrusion detection. However, many adversarial attack methods have emerged recently, considering deep neural networks as machine learning models. Therefore, we consider applying them to SVMs and put forward an effective defense strategy against the attacks. In this paper, we aim to develop secure kernel machines against a prevalent attack method that was previously proposed in deep neural networks. This defense approach is based on the kernel optimization of SVMs with radial basis function kernels. To test this hypothesis, we evaluate our approach on MNIST and CIFAR-10 image classification datasets, and the experimental results show that our method is beneficial and makes our classifier more robust. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adversarial machine learning; Kernel optimization; Support vector machines","Classification (of information); Computers; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Image classification; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Malware; Network security; Neural networks; Application fields; Classification datasets; Kernel optimizations; Machine learning models; Malware detection; Radial basis function kernels; Security problems; Support vector machine (SVMs); Support vector machines","Vorobeychik, Y., Adversarial machine learning (2018) Synthesis Lectures on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, 12 (3), pp. 1-169. , , vol., no.

Due to IP-Convergence, the control systems and sensor/actuator communication networks are often directly or indirectly connected to the Internet. While network intrusion detection can provide certain cyber defense capabilities, that is not sufficient due to covert attacks or insider attacks. Therefore, in recent years, a lot of research is being carried out to detect intrusion by observing anomalies in the plants’ physical dynamics. In this work, we propose a robust anomaly detection mechanism based on a semi-supervised machine learning technique allowing us near real-time localization of attacks. Deep neural network architecture is used to detect anomaly – based on reconstruction error. We demonstrate our method’s efficacy on the SWaT dataset. Our method outperforms other existing anomaly detection techniques with an AUC score of 0.9275. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Autoencoder; Cyber-physical system; Denoising autoencoder; Industrial control system; Intrusion detection system; Localization; MODBUS; Neural networks; Robustness; SCADA; SWaT dataset; Vulnerabilty","Anomaly detection; Cryptography; Cyber Physical System; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Embedded systems; Intrusion detection; Network architecture; Network security; Semi-supervised learning; Anomaly based intrusion detection systems; Cyber physicals; Detection mechanism; Network intrusion detection; Physical dynamics; Reconstruction error; Semi-supervised; Sensor/actuator; Learning systems","Bernabeu, E.E., Thorp, J.S., Centeno, V., Methodology for a security/dependability adaptive protection scheme based on data mining (2011) IEEE Trans.

The development of efficient and reliable Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) is an effective countermeasure against the growing cyber threats. In modern high-bandwidth, large-scale network environments, traditional IDSs suffer from a high rate of missed and false alarms. Researchers have introduced machine learning techniques into intrusion detection with good results. However, due to the scarcity of attack data, such methods' training sets are usually unbalanced, affecting the analysis performance. In this paper, we survey and analyze the design principles and shortcomings of existing oversampling methods. Based on the findings, we take the perspective of imbalance and high dimensionality of datasets in the field of intrusion detection and propose an oversampling technique based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and feature selection. Specifically, we model the complex high-dimensional distribution of attacks based on Gradient Penalty Wasserstein GAN (WGAN-GP) to generate additional attack samples. We then select a subset of features representing the entire dataset based on analysis of variance, ultimately generating a rebalanced low-dimensional dataset for machine learning training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposal, we conducted experiments based on the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS-2017 datasets. The experimental results show that our method can effectively improve the detection performance of machine learning models and outperform the baselines. © 2021 Xiaodong Liu et al.",,"Feature extraction;

However, it is still necessary to dedicate effort towards investigating protection mechanisms against cyberattacks in these scenarios. Despite the power demonstrated by Anomaly Detection-based Intrusion Detection Systems in industrial scenarios, their vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, especially to evasion attacks, make Machine Learning and Deep Learning models ineffective for real scenarios. These type of attacks craft samples misclassified by the Intrusion Detection System and potentially reach industrial devices, causing potentially damaging impacts to factory workers and industry resources. Adversarial attacks linked to industrial scenarios are currently in early stages of development, hence most of them have the capability to craft samples misclassified by the IDS but not reach industrial devices. In this work, we present a new adversarial attack named Selective and Iterative Gradient Sign Method that overcomes the limitation of the adversarial attacks present in the literature. To complement this work we also detail a study of how the detection rate of an Intrusion Detection System is degraded and the time required by each technique to generate adversarial samples. The experiments were carried out using a dataset named Electra, collected from an Electric Traction Substation, and showed that adversarial attacks evaluated crafted samples misclassified by the IDS. However, only the method we proposed generated samples that can be understood by intermediate network devices and, therefore, reach their destination. Our experiment outputs demonstrate a lower period of time to achieve and craft adversarial samples using out our iterative based process method as opposed to other current iterative methods currently available. © 2021 The Authors.

In reality, intrusion detection systems pay more attention to the detection accuracy of a small number of classes, that is, attack samples. In order to improve the detection accuracy of intrusion detection system, a network intrusion detection method based on deep convolution generative adversarial networks (DCGAN) was proposed. Firstly, the sample data of network intrusion is preprocessed, and the character data set is replaced by image data. Then, DCGAN is used to train and test the sample data. Both the generator and the discriminator are constructed by CNN. The generator is used to construct attack samples, balance the number of training samples, and solve the over fitting problem caused by insufficient training samples. Finally, the trained discriminator is used to test the classification accuracy of samples.

It assesses this cyber attack from the steady state and optimal scheduling point of view. In order to stop the cyber hacking, a new deep learning-based framework has been developed based on the generative adversarial networks (GANs). In this framework, two networks compete with each other, wherein the first network generates fake data, and the second one is responsible for the data classification. In order to get into the most optimal features, a new optimization method based on a modified teaching-learning based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is also devised to reinforce the GAN model and help a better matching training process. In addition, a new modification is introduced for TLBO to avoid premature convergence and provide high population diversity. To show the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a real dataset of several smart metering devices in a MG has been tested. Results illustrate the high performance of the proposed framework, comparing to the well-known conventional detection frameworks with hit rate of 93.11%, miss rate of 6.89%, false alarm rate of 7.76% and correct reject rate of 92.24%. © 2013 IEEE.","Cyberattack; data injection; intrusion detection; prediction interval; smart meters","Microgrids; Personal computing; Security of data; Adversarial networks; Conventional detection; Data classification; Modified teaching-learning-based optimizations; Optimal scheduling; Optimization method; Population diversity; Pre-mature convergences; Deep learning","Mishra, S., Anderson, K., Miller, B., Boyer, K., Warren, A., Microgrid resilience: A holistic approach for assessing threats, identifying vulnera-bilities, and designing corresponding mitigation strategies (2020) Appl.

As a strategy to alleviate the escalation of resource congestion, collaborative edge computing (CEC) has become a new paradigm for solving the needs of the Internet of Things (IoT). CEC can provide computing, storage, and network connection resources for remote devices. Because the edge network is closer to the connected devices, it involves a large amount of users' privacy. This also makes edge networks face more and more security issues, such as Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, unauthorized access, packet sniffing, and man-in-the-middle attacks. To combat these issues and enhance the security of edge networks, we propose a deep learning-based intrusion detection algorithm. Based on the generative adversarial network (GAN), we designed a powerful intrusion detection method. Our intrusion detection method includes three phases. First, we use the feature selection module to process the collaborative edge network traffic. Second, a deep learning architecture based on GAN is designed for intrusion detection aiming at a single attack. Finally, we propose a new intrusion detection model by combining several intrusion detection models that aim at a single attack. Intrusion detection aiming at multiple attacks is realized through the designed GAN-based deep learning architecture. Besides, we provide a comprehensive evaluation to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In this study, we evaluate the vulnerability of contemporary datasets (in particular, UNSW-NB15 and Bot-IoT datasets) that represent the modern network environment against popular adversarial deep learning attack methods, and assess various machine learning classifiers’ robustness against the generated adversarial samples.

However, and despite the progress made in this area, machine learning models have been found to be vulnerable to slightly modified data samples called adversarial examples. Thereby, a small and well-computed perturbation may allow adversaries to evade intrusion detection systems. Numerous works have already successfully applied adversarial examples to network intrusion detection datasets. Yet little attention was given so far to the practicality of these examples in the implementation of end-to-end network attacks. In this paper, we study the applicability of network attacks based on adversarial examples in real networks.

IAS are highly cognitive, rich in knowledge discovery, reflective through rapid adaptation, and provide security assurance. It is paramount to have effective reasoning, decision-making, and understanding of operational context since IAS are exposed to advanced multi-stage attacks during training and inference time. Advanced malware types such as file-less malware with benign initial execution phase can mislead IAS to accept them as normal processes and execute malicious code later. IAS are also exposed to adaptive poisoning attacks where adversary inputs malicious data into training/testing set to manipulate the learning. Hence it is vital to monitor IAS activities/interactions to conduct forensics. This project will advance science of security in IAS through multifaceted advanced analytics, cognitive and adversarial machine learning, and cyber attribution based on the following approaches. (a) Implement deep learning-based application profiling to categorize adaptive cyberattacks and poison attacks on machine learning models using contextual information about the origin, trust, and transformation of data. (b) Using HW/OS/SW data to develop perception algorithms using LSTM deep neural networks for detecting malware/anomalies and classifying dynamic attack contexts. (c) Facilitate cyber attribution for forensics through privacy-preserving provenance structure for knowledge representation and perform intrusion detection sampling on HW /OS/SW data. (d) Employ advanced data analytics to aid ontological and semantic reasoning models to enhance decision-making, attack adaptiveness, and self-healing. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

Machine learning technique has been used in advanced intrusion detection system (IDS) which detects new attacks by analyzing existing attacks’ metrics with the help of rich collection of datasets. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) has found lots of attentions in recent times, in particular, for forgery detection in image data. GAN also shows its potential that can be used in text-based traffic inspection to check whether the traffic contains any suspicious strings. In this paper, we present an intrusion detection system using GAN, termed as GIDS, that detects anomalies in input strings with a reasonable accuracy. GIDS minimizes the mapping error without using an external encoder. The analysis and experimental results show that GIDS detects anomalies with an accuracy of 83.66%, while keeping false positive rate low. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Anomaly detection; Generative adversarial network; Intrusion detection; Network security","Computer crime; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Network security; Adversarial networks; Cyber security; False positive rates; Forgery detections; Intrusion Detection Systems; Machine learning techniques; Malicious entity; Reasonable accuracy; Anomaly detection","Crothers, T., (2020) Implementing Intrusion Detection Systems: A Hands-On Guide for Securing the Network, , Wiley; Goodfellow, I.J., Generative adversarial networks (2014) Commun.

However, detecting intrusions using deep learning methods from infrared images captured at night remains a challenging task because of the lack of sufficient training samples. To address this issue, a transfer strategy that migrates daytime RGB images to the nighttime style of infrared images is proposed in this study. The proposed method consists of two stages. In the first stage, a data generation model is trained on the basis of generative adversarial networks using RGB images and a small number of infrared images, and then, synthetic samples are generated using a well-Trained model. In the second stage, a single shot multibox detector (SSD) model is trained using synthetic data and utilized to detect abnormal objects from infrared images at nighttime. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, two groups of experiments, namely, railway and non-railway scenes, are conducted. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and an improvement of 17.8% is achieved for object detection at nighttime. © 2021-IOS Press.

However, a network-based intrusion detection system can be deceived by attackers that imitate the system’s normal activity. In this work, we proposed a novel solution to this problem based on measurement data in the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The proposed approach is called measurement intrusion detection system (MIDS), which enables the system to detect any abnormal activity in the system even if the attacker tries to conceal it in the system’s control layer. A supervised machine learning model is generated to classify normal and abnormal activities in an ICS to evaluate the MIDS performance. A hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed is developed to simulate the power generation units and exploit the attack dataset. In the proposed approach, we applied several machine learning models on the dataset, which show remarkable performances in detecting the dataset’s anomalies, especially stealthy attacks. The results show that the random forest is performing better than other classifier algorithms in detecting anomalies based on measured data in the testbed. © 2021 by the authors.

Most existing machine learning-based IDSs learn patterns from the features extracted from network traffic flows, and the deep learning-based approaches can learn data distribution features from the raw data to differentiate normal and anomalous network flows. Although having been used in the real world widely, the above methods are vulnerable to some types of attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework, Anti-Intrusion Detection AutoEncoder (AIDAE), to generate features to disable the IDS. In the proposed framework, an encoder transforms features into a latent space, and multiple decoders reconstruct the continuous and discrete features, respectively. Additionally, a generative adversarial network is used to learn the flexible prior distribution of the latent space. The correlation between continuous and discrete features can be kept by using the proposed training scheme. Experiments conducted on NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS2017 datasets show that the generated features indeed degrade the detection performance of existing IDSs dramatically. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Autoencoder; Cyber attacks; Generative adversarial networks; Intrusion detection",,"Sun, N., Zhang, J., Rimba, P., Gao, S., Zhang, L.Y., Xiang, Y., Data-driven cybersecurity incident prediction: a survey (2018) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 21 (2), pp. 1744-1772; Liu, Q., Li, P., Zhao, W., Cai, W., Yu, S., Leung, V.C., A survey on security threats and defensive techniques of machine learning: a data driven view (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 12103-12117; Zhang, J., Xiang, Y., Wang, Y., Zhou, W., Xiang, Y., Guan, Y., Network traffic classification using correlation information (2012) IEEE Trans.

Generative adversarial nets (GAN)-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) for in-vehicle network can eliminate the limit of insufficient types of attack data suffered by the deep learning-based IDSs. The existing GAN-based IDS is a hybrid deep learning model built by DNN and GAN, which is too complex to have a short detection time. The evaluation performance of this model can be further improved. To mitigate this issue, we propose another GAN-based intrusion detection method for in-vehicle network, which is a single improved GAN. The proposed model can have better evaluation metrics, e.g., the testing accuracy rate is up to 99.8% and poor detection performance is addressed when a single GAN is used in intrusion detection for the in-vehicle network. In this paper, we design a new loss function for generator in GAN to enhance an ability to produce fake abnormal data, and utilize a sparse enhancement training method helping discriminator in GAN to correct the arbitration bias for fake attack data every 100 steps. In addition, we utilize fewer convolution and de-convolution layers for constructing GAN model, which can reduce the calculation time theoretically and ultimately shorten the detection time to 0.12±0.03ms for a data block built by 64 CAN messages. We evaluate this improved GAN-based intrusion detection by test set. The results demonstrate that our method has not only a capacity of five classifications, but also better evaluation performance than the existing method in the area of GAN-based IDSs for the in-vehicle network. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.","CAN; GAN; IDSs; in-vehicle network","Control system synthesis; Convolution; Deep learning; Learning systems; Network security; Privacy by design; Vehicle performance; Controller area networkbus; Detection performance; Evaluation performance; In-vehicle networks; Intrusion detection method; Intrusion Detection Systems; Privacy and security; Security vulnerabilities; Intrusion detection","Bosch, R., (1991) Can specification, , http://esd.cs.ucr.edu/webres/can20.pdf; Xie, G., Zeng, G., Kurachi, R., Takada, H., Li, Z., Li, R., Li, K., Wcrt analysis of can messages in gateway-integrated in-vehicle networks (2017) IEEE Trans.

Yet, this approach requires huge amounts of barely available labeled training data with recent and realistic behavior. This paper analyzes if the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can improve the quality of LSTM classifiers on flow-based network data. GANs provide an opportunity to generate synthetic, but realistic data without creating exact copies. The classification objective is to separate flow-based network data into normal behavior and anomalies. To that end, we build a transformation process of the underlying data and develop a baseline LSTM classifier and a GAN-based model called LSTM-WGAN-GP. We investigate the effect of training the LSTM classifier only on real world data and training the LSTM-WGAN-GP on real and synthesized data. An experimental evaluation using the CIDDS-001 and ISCX Botnet data sets shows a general improvement in terms of Accuracy and F1-Score, while maintaining identical low False Positive Rates. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","GANs; Intrusion detection; NetFlow; Synthetic data","Information systems; Information use; Intelligent computing; Intrusion detection; Long short-term memory; Metadata; Adversarial networks; Experimental evaluation; False positive rates; Intrusion detection method; Labeled training data; Sequential information; Traffic classification; Transformation process; Classification (of information)","(2017) Cost of Cyber Crime Study, , https://www.accenture.com/t20170926T072837Zw/us-en/acnmedia/PDF-61/Accenture-2017-CostCyberCrimeStudy.pdf, Accenture, Institute, P.: (2017).

Unlike classical network anomaly detectors that observe the network traffic, reconstruction-based detectors operate on the measured sensor data, leveraging physical process models learned a priori. In this work, we investigate different approaches to evade prior-work reconstruction-based anomaly detectors by manipulating sensor data so that the attack is concealed. We find that replay attacks (commonly assumed to be very strong) show bad performance (i.e., increasing the number of alarms) if the attacker is constrained to manipulate less than 95% of all features in the system, as hidden correlations between the features are not replicated well. To address this, we propose two novel attacks that manipulate a subset of the sensor readings, leveraging learned physical constraints of the system. Our attacks feature two different attacker models: A white box attacker, which uses an optimization approach with a detection oracle, and a black box attacker, which uses an autoencoder to translate anomalous data into normal data. We evaluate our implementation on two different datasets from the water distribution domain, showing that the detector's Recall drops from 0.68 to 0.12 by manipulating 4 sensors out of 82 in WADI dataset. In addition, we show that our black box attacks are transferable to different detectors: They work against autoencoder-, LSTM-, and CNN-based detectors. Finally, we implement and demonstrate our attacks on a real industrial testbed to demonstrate their feasibility in real-time. © 2020 ACM.","Adversarial Machine Learning; Autoencoder; Classifier Evasion; Deep Learning; Evasion Attack; Industrial Control System; Intrusion Detection; Mean Squared Error; Multivariate Time Series","Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Security of data; Security systems; Water supply systems; Anomaly detector; Industrial control systems; Industrial controls; Network anomalies; Optimization approach; Physical constraints; Physical process; Water distributions; Anomaly detection","Abrams, M., (2008) Malicious Control System Cyber Security Attack Case Study-Maroochy Water Services, Australia, , 2008; Mujeeb Ahmed, C., Reddy Palleti, V., Mathur, A., WADI: A water distribution testbed for research in the design of secure cyber physical systems (2017) Proceedings of the Workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems for Smart Water Networks).

Various augmentation methods have been proposed to improve data quality and eventually to enhance the performance of DL models. However, the classic augmentation methods cannot be applied to those DL models which exploit the system-call sequences to detect intrusion. Previously, the seq2seq model has been explored to augment system-call sequences. Following this work, we propose a gated convolutional neural network (GCNN) model to thoroughly extract the potential information of augmented sequences. Also, in order to enhance the model’s robustness, we adopt adversarial training to reduce the impact of adversarial examples on the model. Adversarial examples used in adversarial training are generated by the proposed adversarial sequence generation algorithm. The experimental results on different verified models show that GCNN model can better obtain the potential information of the augmented data and achieve the best performance. Furthermore, GCNN with adversarial training can enhance robustness significantly. © 2020, The Author(s).","Data augmentation; Intrusion detection system; Machine learning algorithms; System call","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Augmentation methods; Convolution model; Data augmentation; Data quality; In-field; Sequence generation; System-call sequence; Intrusion detection","Akhtar, N., Mian, A., Threat of adversarial attacks on deep learning in computer vision: A survey (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 14410-14430; Al-Qatf, M., Lasheng, Y., Al-Habib, M., Al-Sabahi, K., Deep learning approach combining sparse autoencoder with svm for network intrusion detection (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 52843-52856; Bahdanau, D., Cho, K., Bengio, Y., (2015) Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate.

However, novel attacks such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) could evade detection of the intrusion detection system, which may lead to serious data leakage in cloud. Existing methods studied the countermeasures to defend against evasion attacks. However, a cloud service provider (CSP) also have to balance between its expect revenue and the security risk of system with limited resources. In this paper, we present the CSP's optimal strategy for effective and safety operation, in which the CSP decides the size of users that the cloud service will provide and whether enhanced countermeasures will be conducted for discovering the possible evasion attacks. While the CSP tries to optimize its profit by carefully making a two-step decision of the defense plan and service scale, the attacker considers its expected revenue to launch evasion attacks or not. To obtain insights of such a highly coupled system, we consider a system with one CSP and one attacker with two attack choices of whether to launch an evasion attack. We propose a two-stage Stackelberg game, in which the CSP acts as the leader who decides the defense plan and service scale in Stage I, and the attacker acts as the follower that determines whether to make evasion attacks in Stage II. We derive the Nash Equilibrium by analyzing the attacker's choices under different scenarios that the CSP selects. Then, we provide the CSP's optimal strategies to maximize its revenue. The simulation results help to better understand the CSP's optimal solutions under different situations. © 2020 IEEE.","Cloud service; Evasion attacks; Game theory; Nash Equilibrium; Stackelberg game","Chemical detection; Intrusion detection; Network security; Optimal systems; Cloud applications; Cloud service providers; Detection methods; Intrusion Detection Systems; Optimal solutions; Optimal strategies; Safety operations; Stackelberg Games; Computer crime","Min, M., Xiao, L., Xie, C., Hajimirsadeghi, M., Mandayam, N.B., Defense against advanced persistent threats in dynamic cloud storage: A colonel blotto game approach (2018) IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 5 (6), pp. 4250-4261; Fang, Z., Wang, J., Li, B., Wu, S., Zhou, Y., Huang, H., Evading anti-malware engines with deep reinforcement learning (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 48867-48879; Xiao, L., Xu, D., Xie, C., Mandayam, N.B., Poor, H.V., Cloud storage defense against advanced persistent threats: A prospect theoretic study (2017) IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 35 (3), pp. 534-544; Yang, L.-X., Li, P., Yang, X., Xiang, Y., Jiang, F., Zhou, W., Effective quarantine and recovery scheme against advanced persistent threat (2019) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems; Chen, J., Zhu, Q., Security as a service for cloud-enabled internet of controlled things under advanced persistent threats: A contract design approach (2017) IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 12 (11), pp. 2736-2750; Feng, X., Zheng, Z., Cansever, D., Swami, A., Mohapatra, P., Stealthy attacks with insider information: A game theoretic model with asymmetric feedback (2016) MILCOM 2016-2016 IEEE Military Communications Conference.

Unfortunately, the fine data perturbation of AE ignores to keep potential data correlations between feature pairs. Thus, such AE will be easily filtered by configuring data correlations as basic filtering rules. In this paper, avoiding not to be filtered as well as causing false classification, an advanced robust AE generation attack is proposed. We first define four basic data correlations called strict linear constraint, approximate linear constraint, addition boundary constraint and zero multiplication constraint. Then, based on embedding multiple data correlations into one constraint matrix from the Pearson analysis, our approach can enable a Hadamard product of the constraint matrix and the sign of gradient matrix to craft perturbations, keeping consistent data correlations. Experimental results on intrusion detection system (IDS) indicate: 1) Nearly all AEs from original IFGSM are invalid by filtering according to basic data correlations; 2) In our method, AEs against a targeted DNN-based classifier can achieve an attack success rate of 99%, with transfer attack ability of 94% average success rate to attack other different mainstream classifiers. © 2020 IEEE.","Adversarial examples generation; Deep neural network; Feature constraints; Pearson correlation coefficient","Distributed database systems; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Network security; Turing machines; Boundary constraints; Constraint-based; Data correlations; Data perturbation; Filtering rules; Hadamard products; Intrusion Detection Systems; Linear constraints; Matrix algebra","He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., Deep residual learning for image recognition[c] (2016) Ieee Conference on Computer Vision &Pattern Recognition.

With neural networks being vulnerable to adversarial examples, attackers who wish to cause damage to an ICS can attempt to hide their attacks from detection by using adversarial example techniques. In this work we address the domain specific challenges of constructing such attacks against autoregressive based intrusion detection systems (IDS) in an ICS setting. We model an attacker that can compromise a subset of sensors in a ICS which has a LSTM based IDS. The attacker manipulates the data sent to the IDS, and seeks to hide the presence of real cyber-physical attacks occurring in the ICS. We evaluate our adversarial attack methodology on the Secure Water Treatment system when examining solely continuous data, and on data containing a mixture of discrete and continuous variables. In the continuous data domain our attack successfully hides the cyber-physical attacks requiring 2.87 out of 12 monitored sensors to be compromised on average. With both discrete and continuous data our attack required, on average, 3.74 out of 26 monitored sensors to be compromised. © 2020 IEEE.","Machine Learning, Intrusion Detection, Adversarial Examples, Machine Learning Security, Industrial Control Systems, Cyber Physical System Security","Computer crime; Control systems; Cyber Physical System; Damage detection; Long short-term memory; Network security; Water treatment; Auto-regressive; Continuous data; Continuous variables; Cyber physicals; Domain specific; Industrial control systems; Intrusion Detection Systems; Water treatment systems; Intrusion detection","Carlini, N., Wagner, D., Towards evaluating the robustness of neural networks (2017) 2017 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP).

People hope to find reliable anomaly detection technology to help improve the security of cyberspace. The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology provides new development opportunities for anomaly detection technology, and the anomaly detection system based on deep learning performs well in some studies. However, neural networks are highly dependent on data quality, and a small number of poisoned samples injected into the data set will have a huge impact on the results. The online abnormal threat detection system based on deep learning is likely to be attacked by poisoning due to the need for continuous data collection and training. We propose a poisoning attack method using adversarial samples to resist the anomaly detection system based on an unsupervised deep neural network, which can destroy the neural network with as few samples as possible. We verified the effectiveness of poisoning attacks on the network security data set of los alamos national laboratory and further demonstrated its generality on other abnormal detection data set. © 2020 IEEE.","Adversarial sample; Anomaly detection; Poisoning attack; Unsupervised recurrent neural network","Anomaly detection; Computer crime; Deep neural networks; Engineering education; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Recurrent neural networks; Anomaly detection systems; Artificial intelligence technologies; Continuous data collections; Detection technology; Internet environment; Intrusion Detection Systems; Los Alamos National Laboratory; Threat detection system; Network security","Khraisat, A., Gondal, I., Vamplew, P., Kamruzzaman, J., Survey of intrusion detection systems: Techniques, datasets and challenges (2019) Cybersecurity, 2 (1), p. 20; Tuor, A.R., Baerwolf, R., Knowles, N., Hutchinson, B., Nichols, N., Jasper, R., Recurrent neural network language models for open vocabulary event-level cyber anomaly detection (2018) Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence; Tuor, A., Kaplan, S., Hutchinson, B., Nichols, N., Robinson, S., Deep learning for unsupervised insider threat detection in structured cybersecurity data streams (2017) Thirty-First AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence; Chen, X., Liu, C., Li, B., Lu, K., Song, D., (2017) Targeted Backdoor Attacks on Deep Learning Systems Using Data Poisoning; Du, M., Jia, R., Song, D., (2019) Robust Anomaly Detection and Backdoor Attack Detection Via Differential Privacy; Szegedy, C., Zaremba, W., Sutskever, I., Bruna, J., Erhan, D., Goodfellow, I., Fergus, R., (2013) Intriguing Properties of Neural Networks; Chan-Hon-Tong, A., (2019) Adversarial Poisoning and Inverse Poisoning against Deep Learning; Miyato, T., Dai, A.M., Goodfellow, I., Adversarial training methods for semi-supervised text classification (2017) International Conference on Learning Representations; Hochreiter, S., Schmidhuber, J., Long short-term memory (1997) Neural Computation, 9 (8), pp. 1735-1780; Kent, A.D., Comprehensive, multi-source cyber-security events (2015) Los Alamos National Laboratory; Ju, W.-H., Vardi, Y., A hybrid high-order markov chain model for computer intrusion detection (2001) Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 10 (2), pp. 277-295; Forrest, S., Hofmeyr, S.A., Somayaji, A., Longstaff, T.A., A sense of self for unix processes (1996) Proceedings 1996 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy.

Security practitioners need IoT network traffic data to develop and assess network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Emulating realistic network traffic will avoid the costly physical deployment of thousands of smart devices. From an attacker's perspective, generating network traffic that mimics the legitimate behavior of a device can be useful to evade NIDS. As network traffic data consist of sequences of packets, the problem is similar to the generation of sequences of categorical data, like word by word text generation. Many solutions in the field of natural language processing have been proposed to adapt a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate sequences of categorical data. In this paper, we propose to combine an autoencoder with a GAN to generate sequences of packet sizes that correspond to bidirectional flows. First, the autoencoder is trained to learn a latent representation of the real sequences of packet sizes. A GAN is then trained on the latent space, to learn to generate latent vectors that can be decoded into realistic sequences. For experimental purposes, bidirectional flows produced by a Google Home Mini are used, and the autoencoder is combined with a Wassertein GAN. Comparison of different network characteristics shows that our proposed approach is able to generate sequences of packet sizes that behave closely to real bidirectional flows. We also show that the synthetic bidirectional flows are close enough to the real ones that they can fool anomaly detectors into labeling them as legitimate. © 2020 IEEE.","Autoencoder; Deep Learning; Generative Adversarial Network; Internet of Things; Network Security","Clustering algorithms; Deep learning; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Network security; Vector spaces; Adversarial networks; Bi-directional flows; Internet of thing (IOT); NAtural language processing; Network based intrusion detection systems; Network characteristics; Network traffic generation; Security practitioners; Internet of things","Antonakakis, M., April, T., Bailey, M., Bernhard, M., Bursztein, E., Cochran, J., Durumeric, Z., Kallitsis, M., (2017) Understanding the Mirai Botnet, , 26th {USENIX} Security Symposium {USENIX} Security 17; Chaabouni, N., Mosbah, M., Zemmari, A., Sauvignac, C., Faruki, P., Network intrusion detection for iot security based on learning techniques (2019) Ieee Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 21 (3), pp. 2671-2701; Rigaki, M., Garcia, S., Bringing a gan to a knife-fight: Adapting malware communication to avoid detection (2018) 2018 Ieee Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW; Kusner, M.J., Hernandez-Lobato, J.M., (2016) Gans for Sequences of Discrete Elements with the Gumbel-softmax Distribution, , arXiv preprint arXiv 1611.04051; Yu, L., Zhang, W., Wang, J., Yu, Y., Seqgan: Sequence generative adversarial nets with policy gradient (2017) Thirty-First Aaai Conference on Artificial Intelligence; Donahue, D., Rumshisky, A., (2018) Adversarial Text Generation without Reinforcement Learning, , arXiv preprint arXiv 1810 06640; Sommers, J., Barford, P., Self-configuring network traffic generation (2004) Proceedings of the 4th Acm Sigcomm Conference on Internet Measurement.

Supervised classifiers are prone to adversarial evasion, and existing countermeasures suffer from many limitations. Most solutions degrade performance in the absence of adversarial perturbations; they are unable to face novel attack variants; they are applicable only to specific machine learning algorithms. We propose the first framework that can protect botnet detectors from adversarial attacks through deep reinforcement learning mechanisms. It automatically generates realistic attack samples that can evade detection, and it uses these samples to produce an augmented training set for producing hardened detectors. In such a way, we obtain more resilient detectors that can work even against unforeseen evasion attacks with the great merit of not penalizing their performance in the absence of specific attacks. We validate our proposal through an extensive experimental campaign that considers multiple machine learning algorithms and public datasets. The results highlight the improvements of the proposed solution over the state-of-the-art. Our method paves the way to novel and more robust cybersecurity detectors based on machine learning applied to network traffic analytics. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Adversarial attack; botnet; deep reinforcement learning; machine learning; network intrusion detection","Botnet; Deep learning; Learning systems; Reinforcement learning; Security of data; Adversarial learning; Cyber security; Experimental campaign; Multiple machine; Network traffic; State of the art; Supervised classifiers; Training sets; Learning algorithms","Du, M., Li, F., Zheng, G., Srikumar, V., DeepLog: Anomaly detection and diagnosis from system logs through deep learning (2017) Proc.

An intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors the network traffic and system-level applications to detect malicious activities in the network. However, most of the existing IDSs are incapable of providing higher accuracy and less false positive rate (FPR). Therefore, there is a need for adaptive techniques to detect network intrusions that maintain a balance between accuracy and FPR. In this paper, we present a context-adaptive IDS that uses multiple independent deep reinforcement learning agents distributed across the network for accurate detection and classification of new and complex attacks. We have done extensive experimentation using three benchmark datasets including NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15 and AWID on our model that shows better accuracy and less FPR compared to the state-of-the-art systems. Further, we analysed the robustness of our model against adversarial attack and observed only a small decrease in accuracy as compared to the existing models. To further improve the robustness of the system, we implemented the concept of denoising autoencoder. Also, we have shown the usability of our system in real-life application with changes in the attack pattern. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Adversarial attack; AWID; Context; Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent; Denoising autoencoder; FPR; IDS; NSL-KDD; UNSW-NB15","Computer crime; Deep learning; Intelligent agents; Intrusion detection; Network security; Reinforcement learning; Adversarial attack; Auto encoders; AWID; Context; NSL-KDD; UNSW-NB15; Learning systems","Mohamed, A.B., Idris, N.B., Shanmugum, B., A Brief Introduction to Intrusion Detection System (2012) Communications in Computer and Information Science, pp. 263-271. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg, Berlin, Heidelberg; Buczak, A.L., Guven, E., A survey of data mining and machine learning methods for cyber security intrusion detection (2016) IEEE Commun.

In this context, the massive end devices (IoTs) and the large volume of data raise security and privacy challenges. To tackle these issues, the joint use of the Bockchain (BC) and Machine Learning (ML) seems attractive to achieve decentralized, secure, intelligent and efficient management of networks. On the one hand, the BC can greatly facilitate the sharing of training data and ML models, the decentralization of intelligence, security, privacy and reliable ML decision-making. On the other hand, ML may have significant impacts on the development of BC in communications and networking systems, including energy and resource efficiency, scalability, security, privacy and smart contracting. An important aspect of security intends to detect unusual and potentially inappropriate activities according to traffic patterns. This paper focuses on the problem of imbalance data where the number of abnormal samples is significantly lower than that of the normal (secure) ones. In particular, this paper presents a new equilibrium model based on an exciting recent innovation in ML namely Generator Adverse Networks (GANs) to address the problem of class imbalance and data noise to Intrusion Detection System (IDS) performance. The proposed approach use is illustrated by a case study: a smart house system-based scenario. © 2020 IEEE.","Blockchain; Generative Adversarial Network (GAN); Internet of Things (IoT); Intrusion Detection System IDS; Machine Learning; Security","Blockchain; Data Sharing; Decision making; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Privacy by design; Software engineering; Communications and networkings; Efficient managements; Equilibrium modeling; Information and Communication Technologies; Internet of thing (IOT); Intrusion Detection Systems; Resource efficiencies; Security and privacy; Network security","Miraz, M.H., Blockchain of things (bcot): The fusion of blockchain and iot technologies (2019) Advanced Applications of Blockchain Technology, Studies in Big Data, 60, pp. 141-159. , Chapter 7, September, Springer; Yang, Y., Zheng, K., Wu, C., Yang, Y., Improving the classification effectiveness of intrusion detection by using improved conditional variational autoencoder and deep neural network (2019) Sensors, 19 (11), p. 2528; Panetta, K., 5 trends emerge in the gartner hype cycle for emerging technologies (2019) Smarter with Gartner, , https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-trendsemerge-in-gartner-hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies-2018/, Retrieved January 7; Reyna, A., Martín, C., Chen, J., Soler, E., Diáz, M., On blockchain and its integration with iot. challenges and opportunities (2018) Future Generation Computer Systems, 88, pp. 173-190. , May 24; Atzei, N., Bartoletti, M., Cimoli, T., A survey of attacks on ethereum smart contracts (sok) (2017) International Conference on Principles of Security and Trust, LNCS 10204, pp. 164-186. , March; Jesus, E.F., Chicarino, V.R., Albuquerque, C.V., Rocha, A.A., A survey of how to use blockchain to secure internet of things and the stalker attack (2018) Security and Communication Networks, 2018, pp. 1-27. , April 8; Kouicem, D.E., Bouabdallah, A., Lakhlef, H., Internet of things security: A top-down survey (2018) Computer Networks, 141, pp. 199-221. , August 4; Ye, C., Li, G., Cai, H., Gu, Y., Fukuda, A., Analysis of security in blockchain: Case study in 51%-attack detecting (2018) 5th International Conference on Dependable Systems and Their Applications (DSA); Buterin, V., Ethereum white paper.

These cyber attacks often can not be detected by classical information security methods. Moreover, the consequences of cyber attack's impact can be catastrophic. Since cyber attacks leads to appearance of anomalies in the ICS and technological equipment controlled by it, the task of intrusion detection for ICS can be reformulated as the task of industrial process anomaly detection. This paper considers the applicability of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in the field of industrial processes anomaly detection. Existing approaches for GANs usage in the field of information security (such as anomaly detection in network traffic) were described. It is proposed to use the BiGAN architecture in order to detect anomalies in the industrial processes. The proposed approach has been tested on Secure Water Treatment Dataset (SWaT). The obtained results indicate the prospects of using the examined method in practice. © 2020 IEEE.","deep learning; generative adversarial networks (GAN); industrial control systems (ICS); information security",,"Zhang, Q., Zhou, C., Tian, Y.C., Xiong, N., A fuzzy probabilitybayesian network approach for dynamic cybersecurity risk assessment in industrial control systems (2018) Ieee Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 14 (6), pp. 2497-3250; Hink, R.C.B., Goseva-Popstojanova, K., Characterization of cyberattacks aimed at integrated industrial control and enterprise systems: A case study (2016) 2016 Ieee 17th Int.

However, false data attacks, as a major threat with wide targets and severe impacts, have exposed the SG systems to a large variety of security issues. To detect this threat effectively, several machine learning (ML)-based methods have been developed in the past few years. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of these advances. The paper starts by providing a brief overview of SG architecture and its data sources. Moreover, the categories of false data attacks followed by data security requirements are introduced. Then, the recent ML-based detection techniques are summarized by grouping them into three major detection scenarios: non-technical losses, state estimation, and load forecasting. At last, we further investigate the potential research directions at the end of the paper, considering the deficiencies of current ML-based mechanisms. Specifically, we discuss intrusion detection against adversarial attacks, collaborative and decentralized detection framework, detection with privacy preservation, and some potential advanced ML techniques. © 2020","False data; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Security; Smart grid","Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Information management; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Surveys; Decentralized detection; Load forecasting; Machine learning techniques; Non-technical loss; Potential researches; Privacy preservation; Security issues; Security requirements; Smart power grids","Abur, A., Exposito, A.G., Power System State Estimation: Theory and Implementation (2004), CRC press; Adamiak, M., Kasztenny, B., Premerlani, W., (2005), pp. 27-29. , Synchrophasors: definition, measurement, and application.

Detection of encrypted malware command and control traffic based on TCP/IP flow features can be framed as a learning task and is thus vulnerable to evasion attacks. However, unlike e.g. in image processing where generated adversarial samples can be directly mapped to images, going from flow features to actual TCP/IP packets requires crafting the sequence of packets, with no established approach for such crafting and a limitation on the set of modifiable features that such crafting allows.In this paper we discuss learning and evasion consequences of the gap between generated and crafted adversarial samples. We exemplify with a deep neural network detector trained on a public C2 traffic dataset, white-box adversarial learning, and a proxy-based approach for crafting longer flows. Our results show 1) the high evasion rate obtained by using generated adversarial samples on the detector can be significantly reduced when using crafted adversarial samples; 2) robustness against adversarial samples by model hardening varies according to the crafting approach and corresponding set of modifiable features that the attack allows for; 3) incrementally training hardened models with adversarial samples can produce a level playing field where no detector is best against all attacks and no attack is best against all detectors, in a given set of attacks and detectors. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that level playing field feature set- A nd iteration-hardening are analyzed in encrypted C2 malware traffic detection. © 2020 ACM.","adversarial learning; intrusion detection; malware command and control","Cryptography; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Feature extraction; Hardening; Image processing; Iterative methods; Transmission control protocol; Adversarial learning; Command and control; Learning techniques; Level playing fields; Neural network detectors; Proxy-based approach; State of the art; Traffic detection; Malware","Anderson, B., Chi, A., Dunlop, S., McGrew, D., Limitless http in an https world: Inferring the semantics of the https protocol without decryption (2019) Proceedings of the Ninth ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy, pp. 267-278. , (Richardson, Texas, USA, Mar.), CODASPY '19, Association for Computing Machinery; Anderson, B., McGrew, D., Machine learning for encrypted malware traffic classification: Accounting for noisy labels and non-stationarity Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 1723-1732. , (New York, NY, USA, 2017), KDD '17, ACM; Anderson, B., Paul, S., McGrew, D., Deciphering malware's use of tls (without decryption) (2018) Journal of Computer Virology and Hacking Techniques, 14 (3), pp. 195-211. , Aug; Apruzzese, G., Colajanni, M., Evading botnet detectors based on flows and random forest with adversarial samples (2018) 2018 IEEE 17th International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA), pp. 1-8; Cheng, A., (2019) 2019 IEEE 10th Annual Information Technology, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference (IEMCON), pp. 0728-0734. , Oct; Demontis, A., Melis, M., Pintor, M., Jagielski, M., Biggio, B., Oprea, A., Nita-Rotaru, C., Roli, F., Why do adversarial attacks transfer explaining transferability of evasion and poisoning attacks (2019) 28th {USENIX} Security Symposium ({USENIX} Security 19), pp. 321-338; Gardiner, J., Nagaraja, S., On the security of machine learning in malware c&c detection: A survey (2016) ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 49 (3), pp. 1-39; Goodfellow, I.J., Shlens, J., Szegedy, C., (2015) Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples, , 1412.6572, [cs, stat] (Mar.); Han, D., Wang, Z., Zhong, Y., Chen, W., Yang, J., Lu, S., Shi, X., Yin, X., (2020) Practical Traffic-space Adversarial Attacks on Learning-based Nidss, , 2005.07519; Laskov, P., Al, E., Practical evasion of a learning-based classifier: A case study (2014) 2014 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 197-211; Lin, Z., Shi, Y., Xue, Z., (2019) IDSGAN: Generative Adversarial Networks for Attack Generation against Intrusion Detection, , 1809.02077, [cs] (June); Marín, G., Casas, P., Capdehourat, G., Deep in the dark-deep learning-based malware traffic detection without expert knowledge (2019) 2019 IEEE Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW), pp. 36-42. , May; Papernot, N., Faghri, F., Carlini, N., Goodfellow, I., Feinman, R., Kurakin, A., Xie, C., Long, R., (2018) Technical Report on the Cleverhans v2.1.0 Adversarial Examples Library, , 1610.00768; Rigaki, M., Garcia, S., Bringing a gan to a knife-fight: Adapting malware communication to avoid detection (2018) 2018 IEEE Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW), pp. 70-75. , May; Ring, M., Schlör, D., Landes, D., Hotho, A., Flow-based network traffic generation using generative adversarial networks (2019) Computers & Security, 82, pp. 156-172. , May; Trevisan, M., Finamore, A., Mellia, M., Munafo, M., Rossi, D., Traffic analysis with off-the-shelf hardware: Challenges and lessons learned (2017) IEEE Commun.

Wide range of applications depends on the high performance of deep learning to solve real-life challenges. Deep learning is being applied in many safety-critical environments. However, deep neural networks have been recently found vulnerable to adversarial examples and backdoor attacks. Stealthy adversarial examples and backdoor attacks can easily fool deep neural networks to generate the wrong results. The risk of adversarial examples attacks that target deep learning models impedes the wide deployment of deep neural networks in safety-critical environments. In this work we propose a defensive technique for deep learning by combining activation function and neurons pruning to reduce the effects of adversarial examples and backdoor attacks. We evaluate the efficacy of the method on an anomaly detection application using Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Coupled Generative Adversarial Network (CoGAN). The method reduces the loss of accuracy from the attacks from an average 10% to 2% using DBN and from an average 14% to 2% using CoGAN. We evaluate the method using two benchmark datasets: NSL-KDD and ransomware. © 2020 IEEE.","Adversarial Examples; Backdoor Attacks; Deep Learning; GAN; Intrusion Detection System; Neural Network","Anomaly detection;

These NIDS perform better when they can monitor all the traffic traversing through the network like when being deployed on a Software-Defined Network (SDN). Because of the inability to detect zeroday attacks, signature-based NIDS which were traditionally used for detecting malicious traffic are beginning to get replaced by anomaly-based NIDS built on neural networks. However, recently it has been shown that such NIDS have their own drawback namely being vulnerable to the adversarial example attack. Moreover, they were mostly evaluated on the old datasets which don't represent the variety of attacks network systems might face these days. In this paper, we present Reconstruction from Partial Observation (RePO) as a new mechanism to build an NIDS with the help of denoising autoencoders capable of detecting different types of network attacks in a low false alert setting with an enhanced robustness against adversarial example attack. Our evaluation conducted on a dataset with a variety of network attacks shows denoising autoencoders can improve detection of malicious traffic by up to 29% in a normal setting and by up to 45% in an adversarial setting compared to other recently proposed anomaly detectors. © 2020 IEEE.","Adversarial Example; Anomaly Detection; Intrusion Detection Systems; Neural Networks","Computer crime; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Network security; Rhenium compounds; Software defined networking; Transfer functions; Anomaly detector; Anomaly-based NIDS; Malicious traffic; Network intrusion detection systems; Network systems; New mechanisms; Partial observation; Zero day attack; Network function virtualization","(2019) Internet Security Threat Report, , https://www.symantec.com/security-center/threat-report, Symantec; (2016) Cyber-Attack against Ukrainian Critical Infrastructure, , www.ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/IR-ALERT-H-16-056-01, ics-cert; Kumar, R.S.S., Wicker, A., Swann, M., Practical machine learning for cloud intrusion detection: Challenges and the way forward (2017) Proceedings of the 10th Acm Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Security, Ser.

Deep learning-based detectors can be however vulnerable to adversarial examples, by which attackers that may be oblivious to the precise mechanics of the targeted NIDS add subtle perturbations to malicious traffic features, with the aim of evading detection and disrupting critical systems in a cost-effective manner. Defending against such adversarial attacks is therefore of high importance, but requires to address daunting challenges. In this paper, we introduce Tiki-Taka, a general framework for (i) assessing the robustness of state-of-the-art deep learning-based NIDS against adversarial manipulations, and which (ii) incorporates our proposed defense mechanisms to increase the NIDS' resistance to attacks employing such evasion techniques. Specifically, we select five different cutting-edge adversarial attack mechanisms to subvert three popular malicious traffic detectors that employ neural networks. We experiment with a publicly available dataset and consider both one-to-all and one-to-one classification scenarios, i.e., discriminating illicit vs benign traffic and respectively identifying specific types of anomalous traffic among many observed. The results obtained reveal that, under realistic constraints, attackers can evade NIDS with up to 35.7% success rates, by only altering time-based features of the traffic generated. To counteract these weaknesses, we propose three defense mechanisms, namely: model voting ensembling, ensembling adversarial training, and query detection. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to propose defenses against adversarial attacks targeting NIDS. We demonstrate that when employing the proposed methods, intrusion detection rates can be improved to nearly 100% against most types of malicious traffic, and attacks with potentially catastrophic consequences (e.g., botnet) can be thwarted. This confirms the effectiveness of our solutions and makes the case for their adoption when designing robust and reliable deep anomaly detectors. © 2020 ACM.","adversarial attacks; deep learning; network intrusion detection systems",,"Abadi, M., Barham, P., Chen, J., Chen, Z., Davis, A., TensorFlow: A system for large-scale machine learning (2016) OSDI; Abbasi, M., Gagné, C., Robustness to adversarial examples through an ensemble of specialists (2017) Workshop in ICLR; Arjovsky, M., Chintala, S., Bottou, L., Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (2017) ICML; Bell, S., Bala, K., Learning visual similarity for product design with convolutional neural networks (2015) ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 34 (4), p. 98. , 2015; Brendel, W., Rauber, J., Bethge, M., Decision-based adversarial attacks: Reliable attacks against black-box machine learning models (2018) ICLR; Buczak, A.L., Guven, E., A survey of data mining and machine learning methods for cyber security intrusion detection (2015) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 18 (2), pp. 1153-1176. , 2015; Carlini, N., Wagner, D., Adversarial examples are not easily detected: Bypassing ten detection methods (2017) Proc.

This makes Tor attractive to cyber criminals, and the anonymity provided can be misused by hackers to enable remote control of victim systems. Indeed, a large volume of Tor traffic is used for malicious purposes such as fast port scans, hacking attempts, ex-filtration of stolen credentials, etc. This makes Tor traffic detection an important component of intrusion detection and prevention systems. Hence, in this paper we present a deep neural network (DNN) based system for the detection and classification of encrypted Tor traffic. The system achieved 99.89% accuracy in the classification of Tor and non-Tor traffic on the UNB-CIC Tor network dataset. Experiments conducted for classifying Tor traffic types demonstrated an accuracy of 95.6%, which is 6.2% higher than previous work on the same dataset. Additionally, the robustness of the proposed DNN classifier is evaluated using adversarial samples generated from a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We observed that 100% of the adversarial examples were unidentified by the DNN classifiers. Further retraining of the DNN classifiers with adversarial examples eventually improved their robustness against the adversarial attack. © 2020 IEEE.",,"Classification (of information); Deep neural networks; Intrusion detection; Network security; Personal computing; Remote control; Adversarial networks; Cyber criminals; Free software; Intrusion detection and prevention systems; Large volumes; Onion routers; Tor networks; Traffic detection; Deep learning","Saputra, F.A., Nadhori, I.U., Barry, B.F., Detecting and blocking onion router traffic using deep packet inspection (2016) Electronics Symposium (Ies), 2016 International, , ieee; AlSabah, M., Bauer, K., Goldberg, I., Enhancing tor's performance using real-time traffic classification Proceedings of the 2012 Acm Conference on Computer and Communications Security; Nguyen, T.T.T., Armitage, G., A survey of techniques for internet traffic classification using machine learning (2008) Ieee Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 10 (4), pp. 56-76; Dingledine, R., Mathewson, N., Syverson, P., (2004) Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router, , Naval Research Lab Washington DC; Basant, S., Biswas, S., Karmakar, S., A neural network based system for intrusion detection and attack classification (2016) Communication (NCC), 2016 Twenty Second National Conference on, pp. 1-6; Moore, A.W., Zuev, D., Internet traffic classification using bayesian analysis techniques (2005) Acm Sigmetrics Performance Evaluation Review, 33 (1), pp. 50-60; Nguyen, T.T.T., Armitage, G., A survey of techniques for internet traffic classification using machine learning (2008) Ieee Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 10 (4), pp. 56-76; Zhang, Q., Yang, L.T., Chen, Z., Li, P., A survey on deep learning for big data (2018) Information Fusion, 42, pp. 146-157; Zahangir, A., Taha, T.M., Yakopcic, C., Westberg, S., Hasan, M., Van Esesn, B.C., Awwal, A.A.S., Asari, V.K., (2018) The History Began from AlexNet: A Comprehensive Survey on Deep Learning Approaches, , arXiv preprint; Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 1097-1105; Majumder, N., Poria, S., Gelbukh, A., Cambria, E., Deep learning-based document modeling for personality detection from text (2017) Ieee Intelligent Systems, 32 (2), pp. 74-79; Lv, Y., Duan, Y., Kang, W., Li, Z., Wang, F.Y., Traffic flow prediction with big data: A deep learning approach (2015) Ieee Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 16 (2), pp. 865-873; Lopez-Martin, M., Carro, B., Sanchez-Esguevillas, A., Lloret, J., Network traffic classifier with convolutional and recurrent neural networks for internet of things (2017) Ieee Access, 5, p. 1804218050; Yerima, S.Y., Alzaylaee, M.K., High accuracy phishing detection based on convolutional neural networks"" (2020) Proc. 3rd International Conference on Computer Applications and Information Security (ICCAIS, pp. 19-21. , Mar; Ali, W., Ahmed, A.A., Hybrid intelligent phishing website prediction using deep neural networks with genetic algorithm-based feature selection and weighting (2019) Iet Information Security, 13 (6), p. 659669; Yerima, S.Y., Alzaylaee, M.K., Mobile botnet detection: A deep learning approach using convolutional neural networks (2020) 2020 International Conference on Cyber Situational Awareness, Data Analytics and Assessment (CyberSA), pp. 1-8. , Dublin, Ireland; Goodfellow, I., Generative adversarial nets (2014) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems; Salimans, T., Improved techniques for training gans (2016) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems; Ioffe, S., Szegedy, C., Batch normalization: Accelerating deep network training by reducing internal covariate shift (2015) International Conference on Machine Learning; Hodo, E., Machine learning approach for detection of nontor traffic Journal of Cyber Security, 6 (2), pp. 171-194; Lashkari, A.H., Characterization of tor traffic using time based features (2017) Icissp; Bai, X., Zhang, Y., Niu, X., Traffic identification of tor and web-mix (2008) 2008 Eighth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications, 1, pp. 548-551; Chaabane, A., Manils, P., Kaafar, M.A., Digging into anonymous traffic: A deep analysis of the tor anonymizing network (2010) Proceedings of the 2010 Fourth International Conference on Network and System Security, Nss 10, p. 167174. , Washington, DC, USA.

However, machine learning algorithms are very vulnerable under the attacks of adversarial samples. Up to now, multiple methods of generating adversarial samples have been proposed. However, they cannot be applied to LSTM-based DDoS detection directly because of the discrete property and the utility requirement of its input samples. In this paper, we propose two methods to generate DDoS adversarial samples, named Genetic Attack (GA) and Probability Weighted Packet Saliency Attack (PWPSA) respectively. Both methods modify original input sample by inserting or replacing partial packets. In GA, we evolve a set of modified samples with genetic algorithm and find the evasive variant from it. In PWPSA, we modify original sample iteratively and use the position saliency as well as the packet score to determine insertion or replacement order at each step. Experimental results on CICIDS2017 dataset show that both methods can bypass DDoS detectors with high success rate. © 2020 IEEE.","Adversarial samples; DDoS detector; genetic algorithm; LSTM; probability weighted","Genetic algorithms; Intrusion detection; Iterative methods; Long short-term memory; Machine learning; DDoS detection; Input sample; Intrusion Detection Systems; Multiple methods; Original sample; Partial packets; Learning algorithms","Alzantot, M., Sharma, Y., Elgohary, A., Ho, B., Srivastava, M., Chang, K., Generating natural language adversarial examples , 2018, pp. 2890-2896; Chen, T., Tang, K., Chen, G., Yao, X., A large population size can be unhelpful in evolutionary algorithms (2012) Theoretical Computer Science, 436, pp. 54-70; Ebrahimi, J., Rao, A., Lowd, D., Dou, D., (2017) Hotflip: White-box Adversarial Examples for Text Classification, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1712 06751; Gong, Z., Wang, W., Li, B., Song, D., Ku, W.-S., (2018) Adversarial Texts with Gradient Methods, , arXiv preprint arXiv 1801 07175; Goodfellow, I., Shlens, J., Szegedy, C., (2014) Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples, , arXiv: Machine Learning; Hashemi, M.J., Cusack, G., Keller, E., Towards evaluation of nidss in adversarial setting (2019) Proceedings of the 3rd Acm CoNEXT Workshop on Big DAta, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for Data Communication Networks, pp. 14-21; Ibitoye, O., Shafiq, O., Matrawy, A., (2019) Analyzing Adversarial Attacks against Deep Learning for Intrusion Detection in Iot Networks, , arXiv preprint arXiv 1905 05137; Kim, J., Kim, J., Thu, H.L.T., Kim, H., (2016) Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network Classifier for Intrusion Detection, pp. 1-5; Kuleshov, V., Thakoor, S., Lau, T., Ermon, S., (2018) Adversarial Examples for Natural Language Classification Problems; Le, T., Kim, J., Kim, H., (2017) An Effective Intrusion Detection Classifier Using Long Short-Term Memory with Gradient Descent Optimization, pp. 1-6; Li, C., Wu, Y., Yuan, X., Sun, Z., Wang, W., Li, X., Gong, L., Detection and defense of ddos attack-based on deep learning in openflow-based sdn International Journal of Communication Systems, 31 (5), p. 2018; Li, J., Ji, S., Du, T., Li, B., Wang, T., (2018) Textbugger: Generating Adversarial Text against Real-world Applications, , arXiv preprint arXiv 1812 05271; Li, Q., Meng, L., Zhang, Y., Yan, J., DDoS Attacks Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms, 5 (2019), pp. 205-216; Li, Y., Lu, Y., (2019) Lstm-ba: Ddos Detection Approach Combining Lstm and Bayes, pp. 180-185; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Goodfellow, I., (2016) Transferability in Machine Learning: From Phenomena to Blackbox Attacks Using Adversarial Samples, , arXiv: Cryptography and Security; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Swami, A., Harang, R., Crafting adversarial input sequences for recurrent neural networks (2016) Milcom 2016-2016 Ieee Military Communications Conference.

The aim of our survey is to examine works completed in the area of GANs, specifically device and network security. This paper also discusses new challenges for intrusion detection systems that have been generated using GANs. Considering the promising results that have been achieved in different GAN applications, it is very likely that GANs can shape security advances if applied to cybersecurity. © 2020 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Cybersecurity; Generative Adversarial Networks; Machine Learning; Security","Intrusion detection; Mobile telecommunication systems; Surveys; Ubiquitous computing; Adversarial networks; Attack scenarios; Cyber security; Defense mechanism; Detection system; Information age; Intrusion Detection Systems; Unknown attacks; Network security","Number of Connected Devices Worldwide 2030-Statista, , https://www.statista.com/statistics/802690/worldwide-connected-devices-by-Access-technology, [Online]; Dutta, I.K., Ghosh, B., Bayoumi, M., Lightweight cryptography for internet of insecure things: A survey (2019) 2019 Ieee 9th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC), pp. 0475-0481; Khalil, K., Elgazzar, K., Ahmed, A., Bayoumi, M., A security approach for coap-based internet of things resource discovery (2020) Ieee 6th World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT); What Is a Cyber Attack?

Recently, Intrusion Detection Systems are rapidly enhancing their detection capabilities using machine learning algorithms. However, these algorithms are vulnerable to new unknown types of attacks that can evade machine learning IDS. In particular, they may be vulnerable to attacks based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). GANs have been widely used in domains such as image processing, natural language processing to generate adversarial data of different types such as graphics, videos, texts, etc. We propose a model using GAN to generate adversarial DDoS attacks that can change the attack profile and can be undetected. Our simulation results indicate that by continuous changing of attack profile, defensive systems that use incremental learning will still be vulnerable to new attacks. © 2020 IEEE.","Adversarial Attacks; DDoS attacks; Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN); IDS; Machine Learning","Computer networks; Denial-of-service attack; Image processing; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Network security; Adversarial networks; Defensive systems; Detection capability; Incremental learning; Intrusion Detection Systems; Malicious traffic; NAtural language processing; Networks and systems; Learning algorithms","Evaluation of Machine Learning Algorithms for Intrusion Detection System, , https://medium.com/cuelogictechnologies/evaluation-of-machine-learning-algorithms-for-intrusiondetection-system-6854645f9211, Cuelogic Technologies; Carlini, N., Wagner, D., Adversarial examples are not easily detected (2017) Proceedings of the 10th ACM Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Security, , https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3128572.3140444, November; Goodfellow, I., Generative adversarial nets (2014) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 27, pp. 2672-2680. , Z.

Network intrusion detection system is a widely used and effective security means at present. In addition, with the development of machine learning technology, various intelligent intrusion detection algorithms also start to sprout. By flexibly combining these intelligent methods with intrusion detection technology, the comprehensive performance of intrusion detection can be improved, but the vulnerability of machine learning model in the adversarial environment can not be ignored. In this paper, we study the defense problem of network intrusion detection system against adversarial samples. More specifically, we design a defense algorithm for NIDS against adversarial samples by using bidirectional generative adversarial network. The generator learns the data distribution of normal samples during training, which is an implicit model reflecting the normal data distribution. After training, the adversarial sample detection module calculates the reconstruction error and the discriminator matching error of sample. Then, the adversarial samples are removed, which improves the robustness and accuracy of NIDS in the adversarial environment. © 2020 IEEE.","adversarial sample; defense technology; machine learning; network and data security; network intrusion system","Computer crime; Machine learning; Network security; Software engineering; Adversarial environments; Comprehensive performance; Intrusion detection algorithms; Intrusion detection technologies; Machine learning models; Machine learning technology; Network intrusion detection systems; Reconstruction error; Intrusion detection","Kumar, S., (2007) Survey of Current Network Intrusion Detection Techniques[J], pp. 1-18. , Washington Univ. in St. Louis; Ahmed, M., Mahmood, A.N., Hu, J., A survey of network anomaly detection techniques[J] (2016) Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 60, pp. 19-31; Weller-Fahy, D.J., Borghetti, B.J., Sodemann, A.A., A survey of distance and similarity measures used within network intrusion anomaly detection[J] (2014) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 17 (1), pp. 70-91; Sommer, R., Paxson, V., Outside the closed world: On using machine learning for network intrusion detection[c] (2010) 2010 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy.

Recently, DLNN has been integrated with intrusion detection system (IDS) to enhance network security to detect zero-day attacks. However, DLNNs themselves have been recently found vulnerable to attacks called adversarial examples and backdoor attacks for image recognition applications. In this work, we present an effective defense method for DLNN based IDS by using Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the generation of triggers neurons selected based on their response to the features to produce the output. We embed the GA-Trigger-Detection neurons within the model to detect and prevent white-box advertorial examples and backdoor attacks against two DLNNs based IDS: Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Stacked Sparse AutoEncoder Based Extreme Learning Machine (SSAELM). We implement two white-box adversarial examples and backdoor attacks from prior work and use them to investigate the proposed defense method. We show that the defense method is sufficient to defend against sophisticated attackers with 99% success rate and only 1% degrade in accuracy. We then show that it successfully weakens backdoor attacks on the two DNN architectures using two benchmark datasets: KDDCUP'99 and Kyoto.

However, while such systems prove invaluable to security personnel, researchers have observed that data subject to inspection by behavioral analysis can be perturbed in order to evade detection. We investigated the use of adversarial techniques for adapting the communication patterns between botnet malware and control unit in order to evaluate the robustness of an existing Network Behavioral Analysis solution. We implemented a packet parser that let us extract and edit certain properties of network flows and automated an approach for conducting a grey-box testing scheme of Stratosphere Linux IPS. As part of our implementation, we provided several techniques for providing perturbation to network flow parameters, including a Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation method, which was able to produce sufficiently perturbed network flow patterns while adhering to an underlying objective function. Our results showed that network flow parameters could indeed be perturbed to ultimately enable evasion of intrusion detection based on the detection models that were used with the Intrusion Detection System. Additionally, we demonstrated that it was possible to combine evading detection with techniques for optimization problems that aimed to minimize the magnitude of perturbation to network flows, effectively enabling adaptive network flow behavior. © 2020 ACM.","Adversarial Techniques; Intrusion Detection; Machine Learning","Approximation theory; Behavioral research; Computer operating systems; Machine learning; Malware; Optimization; Perturbation techniques; Stochastic control systems; Stochastic systems; Turing machines; Behavioral analysis; Communication pattern; Intrusion detection and prevention systems; Intrusion Detection Systems; Objective functions; Optimization problems; Security personnel; Simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation methods; Intrusion detection","Aldweesh, A., Derhab, A., Emam, A.Z., Deep learning approaches for anomaly-based intrusion detection systems: A survey, taxonomy, and open issues (2020) Knowledge-Based Systems, 189, p. 105124; Vahdani Amoli, P., Hamalainen, T., David, G., Zolotukhin, M., Mirzamohammad, M., Unsupervised network intrusion detection systems for zero-day fast-spreading attacks and botnets (2016) JDCTA (International Journal of Digital Content Technology and Its Applications, 10 (2), pp. 1-13; (2018) RED TEAMING METHODOLOGY, , https://www.redteamsecure.com/red-teaming-methodology/, Red Team Security Consulting; (2020) CTU Public Datasets, , https://mcfp.felk.cvut.cz/publicDatasets/, CTU.

Watson Research Center Ibm, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States","Recent work has shown that deep learning (DL) techniques are highly effective for assisting network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) in identifying malicious attacks on networks. Training DL classification models, however, requires vast amounts of labeled data which is often expensive and time-consuming to collect. Also, DL models trained using data from one type of network may not be able to identify attacks on other types of network or identify new families of attacks discovered over time. In this paper, we propose and evaluate the use of adversarial domain adaptation to address the problem of scarcity of labeled training data in a dataset by transferring knowledge gained from an existing network intrusion detection (NID) dataset. Our approach works for scenarios where the source and target datasets have same or different feature spaces. We demonstrate that our proposed approach can create highly accurate DL classification models even when the number of labeled samples in the target dataset is significantly small. © 2020 ACM.","deep learning; intrusion detection; neural networks; transfer learning","Classification (of information); Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Network security; Classification models; Domain adaptation; Highly accurate; Labeled training data; Learning models; Malicious attack; Network intrusion detection; Network intrusion detection systems; Deep learning","NSL-KDD Dataset, , https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html, [n. d. ]; Abadi, M., Barham, P., Chen, J., Chen, Z., Davis, A., Dean, J., Devin, M., Isard, M., Tensorflow: A system for large-scale machine learning (2016) OSDI, 16, pp. 265-283; Arjovsky, M., Chintala, S., Bottou, L., Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (2017) International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 214-223; Bousmalis, K., Irpan, A., Wohlhart, P., Bai, Y., Kelcey, M., Kalakrishnan, M., Downs, L., Konolige, K., Using simulation and domain adaptation to improve efficiency of deep robotic grasping (2018) 2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA).

As the people are trying to adopt and integrate intelligent systems into daily lives, the risks around cyberattacks on user-specific information have significantly grown. To ensure safe communication, the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) were developed often by using machine learning (ML) algorithms that have the unique ability to detect malware against network security violations. Recently, it was reported that the IDS are prone to carefully crafted perturbations known as adversaries. With the aim to understand the impact of such attacks, in this paper, we have proposed a novel random neural network-based adversarial intrusion detection system (RNN-ADV). The NSL-KDD dataset is utilized for training. For adversarial attack crafting, the Jacobian Saliency Map Attack (JSMA) algorithm is used, which identifies the feature which can cause maximum change to the benign samples with minimum added perturbation.

However, what if an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) itself is attacked; in other words what defends the defender? In this work, the focus is on countering attacks on machine learning-based cyberattack detectors. In principle, we propose the adversarial machine learning detection solution. Indeed, contemporary machine learning algorithms have not been designed bearing in mind the adversarial nature of the environments they are deployed in. Thus, Machine Learning solutions are currently the target of a range of attacks. This paper evaluates the possibility of deteriorating the performance of a well-optimised intrusion detection algorithm at test time by crafting adversarial attacks with the four of the recently proposed methods and then offers a way to detect those attacks. The relevant background is provided for both artificial neural networks and four ways of crafting adversarial attacks. The new detection method is explained in detail, and the results of five different classifiers are compared. To the best of our knowledge, detecting adversarial attacks on artificial neural networks has not yet been widely researched in the context of intrusion detection systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,"Computer crime; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Network security; Neural networks; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Detection methods; IDS(intrusion detection system); Intrusion detection algorithms; Intrusion Detection Systems; Network intrusion detection systems; On-machines; Intrusion detection","Xiao, H., Biggio, B., Brown, G., Fumera, G., Eckert, C., Roli, F., Is feature selection secure against training data poisoning?

Thus, most researchers aim to improve the detection performance of classifiers. However, classifiers can only get limited useful information from the limited number of labeled training samples, which usually affects the generalization of classifiers. In order to enhance the network intrusion detection classifiers, we resort to adversarial training, and a novel supervised learning framework using generative adversarial network for improving the performance of the classifier is proposed in this paper. The generative model in our framework is utilized to continuously generate other complementary labeled samples for adversarial training and assist the classifier for classification, while the classifier in our framework is used to identify different categories. Meanwhile, the loss function is deduced again, and several empirical training strategies are proposed to improve the stabilization of the supervised learning framework. Experimental results prove that the classifier via adversarial training improves the performance indicators of intrusion detection. The proposed framework provides a feasible method to enhance the performance and generalization of the classifier. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Adversarial training; Artificial neural network; Generative adversarial networks; Intrusion detection; Machine learning","Classification (of information); Learning systems; Machine learning; Neural networks; Supervised learning; Adversarial networks; Detection performance; Generative model; Intrusion Detection Systems; Network intrusion detection; Performance indicators; Performance of classifier; Training strategy; Intrusion detection","Panda, M., Abraham, A., Das, S., Patra, M.R., Network intrusion detection system: a machine learning approach (2011) Intell Decis Technol, 5 (4), pp. 347-356; Tsai, C.-F., Hsu, Y.-F., Lin, C.-Y., Lin, W.-Y., Intrusion detection by machine learning: a review (2009) Expert Syst Appl, 36 (10), pp. 11994-12000; Reddy, R.R., Ramadevi, Y., Sunitha, K.V.N., Effective discriminant function for intrusion detection using SVM (2016) 2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI), pp. 1148-1153. , https://doi.org/10.1109/icacci.2016.7732199, 21–24 Sept. 2016; Wang, H., Gu, J., Wang, S., An effective intrusion detection framework based on SVM with feature augmentation (2017) Knowl Based Syst, 136, pp. 130-139; Performance analysis of NSL-KDD dataset using ANN (2015) 2015 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Engineering Systems, pp. 92-96. , https://doi.org/10.1109/spaces.2015.7058223, Ingre B, Yadav A, 2–3 Jan 2015; Akashdeep, M.I., Kumar, N., A feature reduced intrusion detection system using ANN classifier (2017) Expert Syst Appl, 88, pp. 249-257; Li, W., Yi, P., Wu, Y., Pan, L., Li, J., A new intrusion detection system based on KNN classification algorithm in wireless sensor network (2014) J Electr Comput Eng, 2014, p. 8; Lin, W.-C., Ke, S.-W., Tsai, C.-F., CANN: an intrusion detection system based on combining cluster centers and nearest neighbors (2015) Knowl Based Syst, 78, pp. 13-21; Masarat, S., Sharifian, S., Taheri, H., Modified parallel random forest for intrusion detection systems (2016) J Supercomput, 72 (6), pp. 2235-2258; Buczak, A.L., Guven, E., A survey of data mining and machine learning methods for cyber security intrusion detection (2016) IEEE Commun Surv Tutor, 18 (2), pp. 1153-1176; Khan, J.A., Jain, N., A survey on intrusion detection systems and classification techniques (2016) Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, 2 (5), pp. 202-208; Hodo, E., Bellekens, X., Hamilton, A., Tachtatzis, C., Atkinson, R., (2017) Shallow and Deep Networks Intrusion Detection System: A Taxonomy and Survey, , arXiv preprint arXiv:170102145; Bengio, Y., Delalleau, O., On the expressive power of deep architectures (2011) Paper Presented at the Proceedings of the 22Nd International Conference on Algorithmic Learning Theory, , Espoo, Finland; Goodfellow, I., Bengio, Y., Courville, A., (2016) Deep learning, , The MIT Press, Cambridge; Salimans, T., Goodfellow, I., Zaremba, W., Cheung, V., Radford, A., Chen, X., Improved techniques for training gans (2016) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2234-2242; Zenati, H., Romain, M., Foo, C., Lecouat, B., Chandrasekhar, V., Adversarially learned anomaly detection Proceedings of the 20Th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM), , https://doi.org/10.1109/icdm.2018.00088, Istanbul, Turkey, 2018.

In order to realize the multi-classification of samples, this paper transforms the previous binary classification model of the generated adversarial network into a supervised learning multi-classification model. The loss function of training is redefined, so that the corresponding training method and parameter setting are obtained. Under the same experimental conditions, several performance indicators are used to compare the detection ability of the proposed method, the original classification model and other models.

We explore different parameters and neural network settings of the learning algorithms, respectively. The returned results show that DAGMM gains the lowest false-positive rate and a relatively high detection rate on one of the data set, whereas SOM achieves the best results on the other data set. By comparing the detection rates of all algorithms on attacks that have no instance in the training set, and we find that K-Means works the better than the other three. Whereas the comparison on the attacks that have few instances in the training set shows that the ALAD works much better than the others since it uses the adversarial sample generation mechanism. We conclude that to achieve the best performance, integration of the traditional and deep-learning algorithms for network flow-based intrusion detection is critical. © 2020 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Intrusion Detection; Network Flow; Unsupervised Learning","Anomaly detection; Big data; Conformal mapping; Deep learning; Gaussian distribution; Intrusion detection; K-means clustering; Self organizing maps; Unsupervised learning; Benchmark data; Detection rates; False positive rates; Gaussian Mixture Model; High detection rate; Network flows; Network settings; Sample generations; Learning algorithms","Tang, T.A., Mhamdi, L., McLernon, D., Zaidi, S.A.R., Ghogho, M., Deep learning approach for network intrusion detection in software defined networking (2016) 2016 International Conference on Wireless Networks and Mobile Communications (WINCOM).

Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) technique is a machine learning technique used in detecting attack vs. benign data. However, it is difficult to construct any effective model when there are imbalances in the dataset that prevent proper classification of attack samples in data. In this research, we use UGR'16 dataset to conduct data wrangling initially. This technique helps to prepare a test set from the original dataset to train the neural network model effectively. We experimented with a series of inputs of varying sizes (i.e. 10000, 50000, 1 million) to observe the performance of the MLP neural network model with distribution of features over accuracy. Later, we use Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model that produces samples of different attack labels (e.g. blacklist, anomaly spam, ssh scan) for balancing the dataset. These samples are generated based on data from the UGR'16 dataset. Further experiments with MLP neural network model shows that a balanced attack sample dataset, made possible with GAN, produces more accurate results than an imbalanced one. © 2020 IEEE.","Adversarial Samples; Generative Adversarial Network (GAN); Imbalanced Dataset; Network security.; Neural Network (NN)","Balancing; Classification (of information); Data Science; Information use; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Multilayer neural networks; Network security; Statistical tests; Turing machines; Adversarial networks; Defense mechanism; Detecting attacks; Imbalanced data problems; Machine learning techniques; MLP neural networks; Multi layer perceptron; Neural network model; Data integration","Kotsiantis, S., Kanellopoulos, D., Pintelas, P., Handling imbalanced datasets: A review (2006) GESTS International Transactions on Computer Science and Engineering, 30 (1), pp. 25-36; Akbani, R., Kwek, S., Japkowicz, N., Applying support vector machines to imbalanced datasets (2004) European Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 39-50. , Springer; Yilmaz, I., (2020) Practical Fast Gradient Sign Attack against Mammographic Image Classifier, , arXiv preprint arXiv 2001 09610; What is Adversarial Machine Learning https://freshbusinessthinking.com/what-is-Adversarial-machine-learning; Lee, Y.O., Jo, J., Hwang, J., Application of deep neural network and generative adversarial network to industrial maintenance: A case study of induction motor fault detection (2017) 2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data).

With the rise of ubiquitous Machine Learning (ML) systems, malicious actors have been catching up quickly to find new ways to exploit ML vulnerabilities for profit. Recently developed adversarial ML techniques focus on computer vision and their applicability to network traffic is not straightforward: Network packets expose fewer features than an image, are sequential and impose several constraints on their features. We show that despite these completely different characteristics, adversarial samples can be generated reliably for RNNs. To understand a classifier's potential for misclassification, we extend existing explainability techniques and propose new ones, suitable particularly for sequential data. Applying them shows that already the first packets of a communication flow are of crucial importance and are likely to be targeted by attackers. Feature importance methods show that even relatively unimportant features can be effectively abused to generate adversarial samples. We thus introduce the concept of feature sensitivity which quantifies how much potential a feature has to cause misclassification. Since traditional evaluation metrics such as accuracy are not sufficient for quantifying the adversarial threat, we propose the Adversarial Robustness Score (ARS) for comparing IDSs and show that an adversarial training procedure can significantly and successfully reduce the attack surface. © 2020 IEEE.","adversarial machine learning; feature importance; interpretable machine learning; intrusion detection systems; recurrent neural networks","Big data; Computer networks; Intrusion detection; Evaluation metrics; Feature sensitivity; Intrusion Detection Systems; Misclassifications; Network packets; Recurrent neural network (RNNs); Sequential data; Training procedures; Recurrent neural networks","Meghdouri, F., Zseby, T., Iglesias, F., Analysis of lightweight feature vectors for attack detection in network traffic (2018) Applied Sciences, 8, p. 2196. , Nov; Bachl, M., Hartl, A., Fabini, J., Zseby, T., Walling up backdoors in intrusion detection systems (2019) Big-DAMA '19, Orlando, FL, USA, pp. 8-13; Hashemi, M.J., Cusack, G., Keller, E., Towards evaluation of nidss in adversarial setting (2019) Big-DAMA '19, (Orlando, FL, USA, pp. 14-21; Friedman, J.H., Greedy function approximation: A gradient boosting machine (2001) The Annals of Statistics, 29 (5), pp. 1189-1232; Sharafaldin, I., Habibi Lashkari, A., Ghorbani, A.A., Toward Generating a New Intrusion Detection Dataset and Intrusion Traffic Characterization (2018) ICISSP, (Funchal, Madeira, Portugal, pp. 108-116; Moustafa, N., Slay, J., UNSW-NB15: A comprehensive data set for network intrusion detection systems (UNSW-NB15 network data set (2015) MilCIS, pp. 1-6. , Nov; Szegedy, C., Zaremba, W., Sutskever, I., Bruna, J., Erhan, D., Goodfellow, I., Fergus, R., Intriguing properties of neural networks (2014) ICLR; Goodfellow, I., Shlens, J., Szegedy, C., Explaining and harnessing adversarial examples (2015) ICLR; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Swami, A., Harang, R., (2016) Crafting Adversarial Input Sequences for Recurrent Neural Networks, , Apr; Carlini, N., Wagner, D., Towards evaluating the robustness of neural networks (2017) S&P, pp. 39-57. , IEEE, May; Madry, A., Makelov, A., Schmidt, L., Tsipras, D., Vladu, A., Towards deep learning models resistant to adversarial attacks (2018) ICLR; Carlini, N., Athalye, A., Papernot, N., Brendel, W., Rauber, J., Tsipras, D., Goodfellow, I., Kurakin, A., (2019) On Evaluating Adversarial Robustness, , Feb; Shapley, L.S., A value for n-person games (1953) Contributions to the Theory of Games, 2 (28), pp. 307-317; Lundberg, S.M., Lee, S.I., A unified approach to interpreting model predictions (2017) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 30, pp. 4765-4774. , Curran Associates, Inc; Dhurandhar, A., Chen, P.Y., Shanmugam, K., Pedapati, T., Balakrishnan, A., Puri, R., (2018) Model Agnostic Contrastive Explanations for Machine Learning Classification Models; Ribeiro, M.T., Singh, S., Guestrin, C., Why Should i Trust You"": Explaining the predictions of any classifier (2016) KDD, San Francisco, California, USA, pp. 1135-1144; Olden, J.D., Joy, M.K., Death, R.G., An accurate comparison of methods for quantifying variable importance in artificial neural networks using simulated data (2004) Ecological Modelling, 178, pp. 389-397. , Nov; Olden, J.D., Jackson, D.A., Illuminating the black box"": A randomization approach for understanding variable contributions in artificial neural networks (2002) Ecological Modelling, 154, pp. 135-150. , Aug; (2019) Neural Networks-Variable Importance in RNN or LSTM, , https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/191855/variableimportance-inRnn-orLstm, StackExchange Cross Validated; Molnar, C., (2019) Interpretable Machine Learning: A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable; (2016) Feature Selection Using Deep Learning, , https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/250381/featureselection-using-deepLearning, StackExchange Cross Validated; Srivastava, N., Hinton, G., Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Salakhutdinov, R., Dropout: A simple way to prevent neural networks from overfitting (2014) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 15, pp. 1929-1958; Chang, C.H., Rampasek, L., Goldenberg, A., (2017) Dropout Feature Ranking for Deep Learning Models; Akhtar, N., Mian, A., Threat of adversarial attacks on deep learning in computer vision: A Survey (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 14410-14430",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728170220,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Due to the high sensitivity to their training data, cyber detectors based on machine learning are vulnerable to targeted adversarial attacks that involve the perturbation of initial samples. Existing defenses assume unrealistic scenarios; their results are underwhelming in non-Adversarial settings; or they can be applied only to machine learning algorithms that perform poorly for cyber security. We present an original methodology for countering adversarial perturbations targeting intrusion detection systems based on random forests. As a practical application, we integrate the proposed defense method in a cyber detector analyzing network traffic. The experimental results on millions of labelled network flows show that the new detector has a twofold value: it outperforms state-of-The-Art detectors that are subject to adversarial attacks; it exhibits robust results both in adversarial and non-Adversarial scenarios. © 2017 IEEE.","Adversarial samples; botnet; flow inspection; intrusion detection; machine learning; random forest","Decision trees; Intrusion detection; Random forests; Cyber security; High sensitivity; Intrusion Detection Systems; Network flows; Network traffic; New detectors; Non-adversarial setting; State of the art; Machine learning","Buczak, A.L., Guven, E., A survey of data mining and machine learning methods for cyber security intrusion detection (2016) Ieee Commun.

However, ML-based models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, attacks wherein slight perturbations of the input features, cause misclassifications. We propose a method that uses active learning and generative adversarial networks to evaluate the threat of adversarial attacks on ML-based IDS. Existing adversarial attack methods require a large amount of training data or assume knowledge of the IDS model itself (e.g., loss function), which may not be possible in real-world settings. Our method overcomes these limitations by demonstrating the ability to compromise an IDS using limited training data and assuming no prior knowledge of the IDS model other than its binary classification (i.e., benign or malicious). Experimental results demonstrate the ability of our proposed model to achieve a 98.86% success rate in bypassing the IDS model using only 25 labeled data points during model training. The knowledge gained by compromising the ML-based IDS, can be integrated into the IDS in order to enhance its robustness against similar ML-based adversarial attacks. © 2020 Owner/Author.","active learning;

While many of the pragmatic problems such as image classification, medical diagnosis, and statistical arbitrage have been addressed by extensive recent research in machine learning, it still lacks substantial work in the field of adversarial attacks on safety-critical networked systems. It is a matter of significant importance, as using the adversarial samples, attackers are now able to evade pre-trained systems and mount black-box attacks hence increasing the false positives. In this research, we are proposing a Random Neural Network-based Adversarial intrusion detection system (RNN-ADV). For adversarial attack generation, the Jacobian Saliency Map Attack (JSMA) algorithm has been used. Swarm optimization capabilities have been implemented by training the system with the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. Different scenarios have been designed and the proposed system is then evaluated with benchmark benign NSL-KDD dataset, adversarial data, and the performance is compared with deep neural networks (DNN) using several performance metrics. The results suggest that the proposed scheme outperforms DNN in terms of adversarial attack detection where it has successfully classified benign samples from crafted samples with better accuracy and high F1 scores. © 2020 IEEE.","Adversarial Machine Learning; Intrusion Detection; JSMA; NSL-KDD; Swarm Intelligence","Benchmarking; Computer aided diagnosis; Deep neural networks; Intrusion detection; Medical imaging; Medical problems; Optimization; Recurrent neural networks; Safety engineering; Artificial bee colony algorithms (ABC); Intrusion Detection Systems; Networked systems; Performance metrics; Random neural network; Recent researches; Statistical arbitrage; Swarm optimization; Learning systems","Qureshi, A.U.H., Larijani, H., Ahmad, J., Mtetwa, N., A heuristic intrusion detection system for internet-of-Things (iot) (2019) 2019 Springer Science and Information (SAI) Computing Conference., , Springer, July; Jover, R.P., The current state of affairs in 5g security and the main remaining security challenges (2019) CoRR, , vol. abs/1904.08394; Sriram, P.P., Wang, H.-C., Jami, H.G., Srinivasan, K., (2019) 5G Security: Concepts and Challenges, pp. 1-43. , Cham: Springer International Publishing; Qureshi, A., Larijani, H., Javed, A., Mtetwa, N., Ahmad, J., Intrusion detection using swarm intelligence (2019) 2019 UK/China Emerging Technologies (UCET), pp. 1-5. , Aug; Karaboga, D., Basturk, B., A powerful and efficient algorithm for numerical function optimization: Artificial bee colony (abc) algorithm (2007) Journal of Global Optimization, 39 (3), pp. 459-471. , Nov; Mirjalili, S., (2019) Genetic Algorithm., pp. 43-55. , Cham: Springer International Publishing; Wang, Z., Deep learning-based intrusion detection with adversaries (2018) Ieee Access, 6, pp. 38367-38384; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Jha, S., Fredrikson, M., Celik, Z.B., Swami, A., The limitations of deep learning in adversarial settings (2016) 2016 Ieee European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS P), pp. 372-387. , March; Martins, N., Cruz, J.M., Cruz, T., Abreu, P.H., Analyzing the footprint of classifiers in adversarial denial of service contexts (2019) Progress in Artificial Intelligence, pp. 256-267. , P.

However, many ML algorithms presume that training and testing data follow the same or similar data distributions, which may not hold in the dynamic time-varying systems like the smart grid. As operating points may change dramatically over time, the resulting data distribution shifts could lead to degraded detection performance and delayed incidence responses. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a semi-supervised framework based on domain-adversarial training to transfer the knowledge of known attack incidences to detect returning threats at different hours and load patterns. Using normal operation data of the ISO New England grids, the proposed framework leverages adversarial training to adapt learned models against new attacks launched at different times of the day. Effectiveness of the proposed detection framework is evaluated against the well-studied false data injection attacks synthesized on the IEEE 30-bus system, and the results demonstrated the superiority of the framework against persistent threats recurring in the highly dynamic smart grid. © 2020 IEEE.","Adversarial training; domain adaptation; false data injection; intrusion detection; smart grid security; transfer learning","Chemical detection; Electric power transmission networks; Network security; Neural networks; Smart power grids; Time varying systems; Cyber-physical threats; Data distribution; Detection framework; Detection performance; False data injection; False data injection attacks; Intrusion Detection Systems; Training and testing; Intrusion detection","Alom, M.Z., Taha, T.M., Network intrusion detection for cyber security on neuromorphic computing system (2017) 2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), pp. 3830-3837. , May; Yousefi-Azar, M., Varadharajan, V., Hamey, L., Tupakula, U., Autoencoder-based feature learning for cyber security applications (2017) 2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), pp. 3854-3861. , May; He, H., Yan, J., Cyber-physical attacks and defences in the smart grid: A survey (2016) Iet Cyber-Physical Systems: Theories & Applications, 1 (1), pp. 13-27; (2015) Business Blackout: The Insurance Implications of a Cyber Attack on the Us Power Grid, , Lloyd's and the University of Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies, Tech.

Given the heavily instrumented property of HPC systems, logs become an effective and direct data source that can be utilized to evaluate the system status, further, to detect anomalies or malicious users. In this paper, we offer a novel perspective, treating the anomaly detection in HPC as a sequential decision process, and further applying reinforcement learning techniques to learn the state transition process, based on which we build a framework named as ReLog to detect anomalies or malicious users. Besides, a common challenge of employing machine learning techniques is lacking sufficient data, we provide a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based solution to generate sufficient training data in HPC. The experimental validations are conducted based on real-world collected MPI logs, and our results demonstrate a 93% of detection accuracy on the collected dataset. © 2020 IEEE.","Defenses and attacks; High performance computing; Log analytics; Reinforcement learning; Security","Anomaly detection; Learning systems; Weather forecasting; Adversarial networks; Detection accuracy; Experimental validations; High performance computing (HPC); Machine learning techniques; Reinforcement learning techniques; Scientific researches; Sequential decision process; Reinforcement learning","Peisert, S., Security in high-performance computing environments (2017) Communications of the Acm, 60 (9), pp. 72-80; Campbell, S., Mellander, J., Experiences with intrusion detection in high performance computing (2011) Proceedings of the Cray User Group (CUG); Bulusu, R., Jain, P., Pawar, P., Afzal, M., Wandhekar, S., Addressing security aspects for hpc infrastructure (2018) 2018 International Conference on Information and Computer Technologies (ICICT).

In this paper, we study the resilience of deep learning-based intrusion detection systems against adversarial attacks. We apply the min-max (or saddle-point) approach to train intrusion detection systems against adversarial attack samples in UNSW-NB 15 dataset. We have the max approach for generating adversarial samples that achieves maximum loss and attack deep neural networks. On the other side, we utilize the existing min approach [1] [2] as a defense strategy to optimize intrusion detection systems that minimize the loss of the incorporated adversarial samples during the adversarial training. We study and measure the effectiveness of the adversarial attack methods as well as the resistance of the adversarially trained models against such attacks. We find that the adversarial attack methods that were designed in binary domains can be used in continuous domains and exhibit different misclassification levels. We finally show that principal component analysis (PCA) based feature reduction can boost the robustness in intrusion detection system (IDS) using a deep neural network (DNN). © 2020 IEEE.","adversarial learning.; adversarial samples; Deep Learning-based Intrusion Detection","Computer crime; Deep neural networks; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Network security; Neural networks; Continuous domain; Defense strategy; Feature reduction; Intrusion Detection Systems; Machine learning models; Min-max optimization; Misclassifications; Network based intrusion detection systems; Deep learning","Al-Dujaili, A., Adversarial deep learning for robust detection of binary encoded malware (2018) 2018 IEEE Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW), pp. 76-82. , IEEE; Madry, A., Towards deep learning models resistant to adversarial attacks (2017) ICLR; Wang, Z., Deep learning-based intrusion detection with adversaries (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 38367-38384; Homoliak, I., Teknos, M., Ochoa, M., Breitenbacher, D., Hosseini, S., Hanacek, P., Improving network intrusion detection classifiers by non-payload-based exploit-independent obfuscations: An adversarial approach (2018) ICST Trans.

In this article, we address the challenges of modeling and detecting advanced network attacks. In particular, we investigate how interleaving multiple multi-stage can exacerbate the stealthiness of the attack and deceive network intrusion detection systems. We design a detection architecture based on a leading statistical machine learning technique, HMM. The proposed architecture deploys a set of HMM templates of recognized multi-stage attacks to detect and track the progress of stealthy attacks. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed architecture for multiple multi-stage attack scenarios in the presence of imperfect partitioning of network data streams and false alerts with various rates. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",,"Data streams; Hidden Markov models; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Network architecture; Network security; Personnel training; Random processes; Servers; State estimation; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Advanced networks; Architecture-based; Explosive growth; Extensive simulations; Multi-stage attack; Network intrusion detection systems; Proposed architectures; Statistical machine learning; Computer crime","(2017) Massive Cyberattack Hits Europe with Widespread Ransom Demands, , Washington Post, accessed: 2017-10-22; Navarro, J., Deruyver, A., Parrend, P., A systematic survey on multistep attack detection (2018) Computers & Security; (2015) Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Dataset (DARPA), , L.

Security operation centers (SOC), which are established to detect, analyze and respond to cyber-security incidents, often utilize detection models either for known types of attacks or for anomaly and applies them to the system data for detection. SOC are also motivated to keep their models private to capitalize on the models that are their propriety expertise, and to protect their detection strategies against adversarial machine learning. In this paper, we develop a protocol for privately evaluating detection models on the system data, in which privacy of both the system data and detection models is protected and information leakage is either prevented altogether or quantifiably decreased. Our main approach is to provide an end-to-end encryption for the system data and detection models utilizing lattice-based cryptography that allows homomorphic operations over ciphertext. We employ recent data sets in our experiments which demonstrate that the proposed privacy-preserving intrusion detection system is feasible in terms of execution times and bandwidth requirements and reliable in terms of accuracy. © 2019 The British Computer Society.

From these threats, the research presented in this paper focuses on masquerader attacks, a category of insiders characterized by being intentionally conducted by persons outside the organization that somehow were able to impersonate legitimate users. Consequently, it is assumed that masqueraders are unaware of the protected environment within the targeted organization, so it is expected that they move in a more erratic manner than legitimate users along the compromised systems. This feature makes them susceptible to being discovered by dynamic user verification methods based on user profiling and anomaly-based intrusion detection. However, these approaches are susceptible to evasion through the imitation of the normal legitimate usage of the protected system (mimicry), which is being widely exploited by intruders. In order to contribute to their understanding, as well as anticipating their evolution, the conducted research focuses on the study of mimicry from the standpoint of an uncharted terrain: the masquerade detection based on analyzing locality traits. With this purpose, the problem is widely stated, and a pair of novel obfuscation methods are introduced: locality-based mimicry by action pruning and locality-based mimicry by noise generation. Their modus operandi, effectiveness, and impact are evaluated by a collection of well-known classifiers typically implemented for masquerade detection. The simplicity and effectiveness demonstrated suggest that they entail attack vectors that should be taken into consideration for the proper hardening of real organizations.","adversarial machine learning; dynamic user verification; insider threats; masquerade attacks; mimicry","computer security; computer simulation; machine learning; Computer Security; Computer Simulation; Machine Learning",,,,"NLM (Medline)",14248220,,,"32272806","English","Sensors (Basel)",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100125577

However, attackers use Artificial Intelligence to improve their attacks and circumvent IDS systems. Botnets use artificial intelligence to improve their Domain Name Generation Algorithms. Botnets pose a serious threat to networks that are connected to the Internet and are an enabler for many cyber-criminal activities (e.g., DDoS attacks, banking fraud and cyber-espionage) and cause substantial economic damage. To circumvent detection and prevent takedown actions, bot-masters use DGAs to create, maintain and hide C&C infrastructures. Furthermore, botmasters often release its source code to prevent detection, leading to numerous similar botnets that are created and maintained by different botmasters. As these botnets are based on nearly the same source code basis, they often share similar observable behavior. Current work on detection of DGAs is often based on applying machine learning techniques, as they are capable to generalize and to also detect yet unknown derivatives of a known botnets. However, these machine learning based classifiers can be circumvented by applying adversarial learning techniques. As a consequence, there is a need for resilience against adversarial learning in current Intrusion Detection Systems. In our work, we focus on adversarial learning in DNS based IDSs from the perspective of a network operator. Further, we present our concept to make existing and future machine learning based IDSs more resilient against adversarial learning attacks by applying multi-level Moving Target Defense strategies. © 2020 IEEE.","Adversarial Learning; Botnet; DGA; Proactive Detection; Resilience","Botnet; Crime; Denial-of-service attack; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Network security; Adversarial learning; Economic damages; Generation algorithm; Intrusion Detection Systems; Machine learning techniques; Moving target defense; Observable behavior; State of the art; Intrusion detection","Cisco Ai Network Analytics."", , https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/enterprise-networks/nb-06-Ai-nw-Analytics-wp-cte-en.html, Cisco [On-line]; Plohmann, D., (2018) DGArchive; Calleja, A., Tapiador, J., Caballero, J., The malsource dataset: Quantifying complexity and code reuse in malware development (2018) IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security; Kim, T., Cha, M., Kim, H., Lee, J.K., Kim, J., Learning to discover cross-domain relations with generative adversarial networks (2017) Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning-Volume 70, pp. 1857-1865; Yin, C., Zhu, Y., Liu, S., Fei, J., Zhang, H., An enhancing framework for botnet detection using generative adversarial networks (2018) 2018 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Big Data (ICAIBD), pp. 228-234; Peck, J., Nie, C., Sivaguru, R., Grumer, C., Olumofin, F., Yu, B., Nasci-Mento, A., De Cock, M., (2019) CharBot: A Simple and Effective Method for Evading Dga Classifiers, , arXiv preprint [Titel anhand dieser ArXiv-ID in Citavi-Projekt übernehmen]; Sidi, L., Nadler, A., Shabtai, A., (2019) MaskDGA: A Black-box Evasion Technique Against Dga Classifiers and Adversarial Defenses, , arXiv preprint [In Citavi anzeigen]; Pau, L.-F., (2013) Botnet Economics and Devising Defence Schemes from Attackers Own Reward Processes, , arXiv preprint [Titel anhand dieser ArXiv-ID in Citavi-Projekt übernehmen]; Berthier, R., Sanders, W.H., Khurana, H., Intrusion detection for advanced metering infrastructures: Requirements and architectural directions (2010) 2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications, pp. 350-355; Grochocki, D., Huh, J.H., Berthier, R., Bobba, R., Sanders, W.H., Cárdenas, A.A., Jetcheva, J.G., Ami threats, intrusion detection requirements and deployment recommendations (2012) 2012 IEEE Third International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGrid-Comm), pp. 395-400; Bambenek, J., Dga Feed, , https://osint.bambenekconsulting.com/feeds/dga-feed.txt, [Online]; Anderson, H.S., Woodbridge, J., Filar, B., Deepdga (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Security-ALSec '16, pp. 13-21. , D.

Supervised machine learning requires a large amount of training data, leading to costly human-labor operation; it requires the human operator to examine data, classify them, and annotate them with a label. To address this issue, we propose an IDS that employs semi-supervised learning. Semi-supervised learning uses a small number of labeled data in training dataset to reduce costly human-labor tasks and improves the performance with support of unlabeled data in training dataset. The proposed method employs Adversarial Auto-encoder (AAE), a semi-supervised learning algorithm that incorporates the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) into the Auto-encoder (AE). We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method using NSL-KDD dataset. We confirm that the proposed method that uses only 0.1 percent of labeled data achieves comparable performance with existing IDSs that use machine learning methods. © 2020 IEEE.","Adversarial Auto-encoder; Intrusion Detection System; Machine learning; Semi-supervised learning","Computer crime; Intrusion detection; Labeled data; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Network security; Personnel training; Signal encoding; Critical component; Human operator; Intrusion Detection Systems; Machine learning methods; NSL-KDD dataset; Supervised machine learning; Training dataset; Unlabeled data; Semi-supervised learning","Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity, , https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/index.html; Pytorch, , https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch; Goodfellow, I.J., Pouget-Abadie, J., Mirza, M., Xu, B., Warde-Farley, D., Ozair, S., Courville, A., Bengio, Y., (2014) Generative Adversarial Networks, , ArXiv e-prints June; Han, J., Pei, J., Kamber, M., (2011) Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, , Elsevier; Kingma, D.P., Ba, J., (2014) Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization, , arXiv preprint; Lippmann, R., Cunningham, R.K., Fried, D.J., Graf, I., Kendall, K.R., Webster, S.E., Zissman, M., Results of the darpa 1998 offline intrusion detection evaluation (1999) Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection, 99, pp. 829-835; Makhzani, A., Shlens, J., Jaitly, N., Goodfellow, I., Frey, B., (2015) Adversarial Autoencoders, , ArXiv e-prints November; Mukherjee, S., Sharma, N., Intrusion detection using naive bayes classifier with feature reduction (2012) Procedia Technology, 4, pp. 119-128; Osada, G., Omote, K., Nishide, T., Network intrusion detection based on semi-supervised variational auto-encoder (2017) Computer Security-ESORICS 2017, pp. 344-361. , In Simon N.

Past work has shown that even proficient detectors are highly affected just by small perturbations to malicious samples, and that existing countermeasures are immature. We address this problem by presenting AppCon, an original approach to harden intrusion detectors against adversarial evasion attacks. Our proposal leverages the integration of ensemble learning to realistic network environments, by combining layers of detectors devoted to monitor the behavior of the applications employed by the organization. Our proposal is validated through extensive experiments performed in heterogeneous network settings simulating botnet detection scenarios, and consider detectors based on distinct machine-and deep-learning algorithms. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of AppCon in mitigating the dangerous threat of adversarial attacks in over 75% of the considered evasion attempts, while not being affected by the limitations of existing countermeasures, such as performance degradation in non-adversarial settings. For these reasons, our proposal represents a valuable contribution to the development of more secure cyber defense platforms. © 2020 by the authors.","Adversarial attacks; Cyber security; Evasion attacks; Machine learning; Network intrusion detection",,"Gardiner, J., Nagaraja, S., On the security of machine learning in malware c&c detection: A survey (2016) ACM Comput.

From these threats, the research presented in this paper focuses on masquerader attacks, a category of insiders characterized by being intentionally conducted by persons outside the organization that somehow were able to impersonate legitimate users. Consequently, it is assumed that masqueraders are unaware of the protected environment within the targeted organization, so it is expected that they move in a more erratic manner than legitimate users along the compromised systems. This feature makes them susceptible to being discovered by dynamic user verification methods based on user profiling and anomaly-based intrusion detection. However, these approaches are susceptible to evasion through the imitation of the normal legitimate usage of the protected system (mimicry), which is being widely exploited by intruders. In order to contribute to their understanding, as well as anticipating their evolution, the conducted research focuses on the study of mimicry from the standpoint of an uncharted terrain: the masquerade detection based on analyzing locality traits. With this purpose, the problem is widely stated, and a pair of novel obfuscation methods are introduced: locality-based mimicry by action pruning and locality-based mimicry by noise generation. Their modus operandi, effectiveness, and impact are evaluated by a collection of well-known classifiers typically implemented for masquerade detection. The simplicity and effectiveness demonstrated suggest that they entail attack vectors that should be taken into consideration for the proper hardening of real organizations. © 2020 by the authors.

The systems alert defenders of suspicious and / or malicious behavior detected on the network. With technological advances in AI over the past decade, machine learning (ML) has been assisting IDS to improve accuracy, perform better analysis, and discover variations of existing or new attacks. However, applications of ML algorithms have some reported weaknesses and in this research, we demonstrate how one of such weaknesses can be exploited against the workings of the IDS. The work presented in this paper is twofold: (1) we develop a ML approach for intrusion detection using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) network and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model with two different network-based IDS datasets; and (2) we perform a model evasion attack against the built MLP network for IDS using an adversarial machine learning technique known as the Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA) method. Our experimental results show that the model evasion attack is capable of significantly reducing the accuracy of the IDS, i.e., detecting malicious traffic as benign. Our findings support that neural network-based IDS is susceptible to model evasion attack, and attackers can essentially use this technique to evade intrusion detection systems effectively. © 2020 IEEE.","Adversarial Machine Learning; Evasion Attack; Intrusion Detection System; Neural Network","Computer crime; Machine learning; Network security; Defensive mechanism; Intrusion Detection Systems; Machine learning techniques; Malicious behavior; Malicious traffic; Multi layer perceptron; Network-based; Technological advances; Intrusion detection","Abadi, M., Barham, P., Chen, J., Chen, Z., Davis, A., Dean, J., Devin, M., Zheng, X., Tensorflow: A system for large-scale machine learning (2016) 12th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI 16), pp. 265-283. , https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi16/osdi16-abadi.pdf; Nitin Bhagoji, A., Cullina, D., Sitawarin, C., Mittal, P., Enhancing robustness of machine learning systems via data transformations (2018) 2018 52nd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS), pp. 1-5. , IEEE; Biggio, B., Corona, I., Maiorca, D., Nelson, B., Srndíc, N., Laskov, P., Giacinto, G., Roli, F., Evasion attacks against machine learning at test time (2013) Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases, pp. 387-402. , Springer; Biggio, B., Roli, F., Wild patterns: Ten years after the rise of adversarial machine learning (2018) Pattern Recognition, 84, pp. 317-331; Carlini, N., Wagner, D., Adversarial examples are not easily detected: Bypassing ten detection methods (2017) Proceedings of the 10th ACM Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Security, pp. 3-14. , ACM; Chen, L., Ye, Y., Bourlai, T., Adversarial machine learning in malware detection: Arms race between evasion attack and defense (2017) 2017 European Intelligence and Security Informatics Conference (EISIC), pp. 99-106. , IEEE; (2016), https://github.com/fchollet/keras, François Chollet.

It relied on building models of the normal/legitimate activities registered at the protected systems, from them analyzing the incoming observations looking for significant discordances that may reveal misbehaviors. But in the last years, the adversarial machine learning paradigm introduced never-seen-before evasion procedures able to jeopardize the traditional anomaly-based methods, thus entailing one of the major emerging challenges in the cybersecurity landscape. With the aim on contributing to their adaptation against adversarial threats, this paper presents EsPADA (Enhanced Payload Analyzer for malware Detection robust against Adversarial threats), a novel approach built on the grounds of the PAYL sensor family. At the SPARTA Training stage, both normal and adversarial models are constructed according to features extracted by N-gram, which are stored within Counting Bloom Filters (CBF). In this way it is possible to take advantage of both binary-based and spectral-based traffic modeling procedures for malware detection. At Detection stage, the payloads to be analyzed are collected from the protected environment and compared with the usage models previously built at Training. This leads to calculate different scores that allow to discriminate their nature (normal or suspicious) and to assess the labeling coherency, the latest studied for estimating the likelihood of the payload disguising mimicry attacks. The effectiveness of EsPADA was demonstrated on the public datasets DARPA'99 and UCM 2011 by achieving promising preliminarily results. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Adversarial machine learning; Anomaly recognition; Communication networks; Intrusion detection; Malware","Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Telecommunication networks; Anomaly recognition; Anomaly-based intrusion detection; Building model; Communication technologies; Counting bloom filters; Cyber security; Detection stage; Malware detection; Malware","Garcia-Teodoro, P., Diaz-Verdejo, J., Tapiador, J., Salazar-Hernandez, R., Automatic generation of HTTP intrusion signatures by selective identification of anomalies (2015) Comput.

However, it is a complex task due to the malware sophisticated ability to evade security mechanisms deployed by cybersecurity practitioners. Evasion is possible due to malware authors changing the malware signature using metamorphism or polymorphism tactics. Currently, it is necessary to formulate a malware detection method focusing on dynamic and automated malware analysis. Malware Indicator of Compromise (IOC) data analysis with machine learning can be used as a technique to obtain the malware signatures. This technical approach is practical as cyber-attacks using malware with new or changed signature are pandemic and remain undetected, therefore, a framework is needed to overcome this situation. Thus, this research proposed a malware detection framework based on forensic and unsupervised machine learning methodologies. The framework is experimented and proven in detecting malware by referring to the signature derived from the analysis. Furthermore, the framework can provide guidelines for cybersecurity practitioners to conduct threat hunting within their IT systems. © 2020 ACM.","big data; cyber threat intelligence; detection framework; indicator of compromise; machine learning; Malware forensic; threat hunting","Application programs; Computer forensics; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Network security; Complex task; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Malware analysis; Malware detection; ON dynamics; Security mechanism; Unsupervised machine learning; Malware","Bat-Erdene, M., Park, H., Li, H., Lee, H., Choi, M., Entropy analysis to classify unknown packing algorithms for malware detection (2017) Int.

Due to the scarce of data, it could significantly deteriorate the accuracy of classification. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Imbalanced Data Augmentation Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) named IDA-GAN as an augmentation tool to deal with the imbalanced dataset. This is a great challenge because it is hard to train a GAN model under this situation. We address this issue by coupling variational autoencoder along with GAN training. In this paper, specifically, we introduce the variational autoencoder to learn the majority and minority class distributions in the latent space, and use the generative model to utilize each class distribution for the subsequent GAN training. The generative model learns useful features to generate target minority-class samples. Compared with the state-of-the-art GAN model, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed IDA-GAN could generate more diverse minority samples with better qualities, and it could benefits the imbalanced classification task in terms of several widely-used evaluation metrics on five benchmark datasets: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10 and GTSRB. © 2020 IEEE","Data augmentation; GAN; Imbalanced learning; Variational autoencoder","Benchmarking; Classification (of information); Diagnosis; Gallium nitride; III-V semiconductors; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Accuracy of classifications; Adversarial networks; Benchmark datasets; Class distributions; Evaluation metrics; Imbalanced classification; Imbalanced dataset; Network intrusion detection; Pattern recognition","Haixiang, G., Yijing, L., Shang, J., Mingyun, G., Yuanyue, H., Bing, G., Learning from class-imbalanced data: Review of methods and applications (2017) Expert Systems with Applications, 73, pp. 220-239; Mazurowski, M.A., Habas, P.A., Zurada, J.M., Lo, J.Y., Baker, J.A., Tourassi, G.D., Training neural network classifiers for medical decision making: The effects of imbalanced datasets on classification performance (2008) Neural Networks, 21 (2-3), pp. 427-436; Chung, Y.-A., Lin, H.-T., Yang, S.-W., (2015) Cost-Aware Pretraining for Multiclass Cost-Sensitive Deep Learning, , arXiv preprint; Huang, C., Li, Y., Loy, C.C., Tang, X., Learning deep representation for imbalanced classification (2016) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 5375-5384; Sun, Y., Kamel, M.S., Wong, A.K., Wang, Y., Cost-sensitive boosting for classification of imbalanced data (2007) Pattern Recognition, 40 (12), pp. 3358-3378; Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 1097-1105; Masi, I., Tran, A.T., Hassner, T., Leksut, J.T., Medioni, G., Do we really need to collect millions of faces for effective face recognition?

The method consists of a double-layer one-class support vector machine model (DL-OCSVM), where the first-layer model is the standard OCSVM, and the second-layer model is obtained by incremental learning based on the former. The wavelet decomposition is used to extract the physical characteristics of the ICS. The KKT condition and the adjacent classification interval are adopted to reduce the training samples, improving the learning rate and system scalability. In addition, the designed boundary samples are employed for incremental learning, avoiding overfitting and reducing false positives rate (FPR). The experimental results show that the proposed method has high detection rate and low FPR for stealthy attacks, and is more suitable for precision machining process. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

To resolve above issues, this article proposes a network intrusion detection model called CWGAN-CSSAE, which combines improved conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (CWGAN) and cost-sensitive stacked autoencoders (CSSAE). First of all, the CWGAN network that introduces gradient penalty and L2 regularization is used to generate specified minority attack samples to reduce the class imbalance of the training dataset. Secondly, the stacked autoencoder is used to intelligently extract the deep abstract features of the network data. Finally, a cost-sensitive loss function is constructed to give a large misclassification cost to a minority of attack samples. Thus, effective detection of network intrusion attacks can be realized. The experimental results based on KDDTestC, KDDTest-21, and UNSW-NB15 datasets show that the CWGAN-CSSAE network intrusion detection model improves the detection accuracy of minority attacks and unknown attacks. In addition, the method in this article is compared with other existing intrusion detection methods, excellent results have been achieved in performance indicators such as accuracy and F1 score. The accuracy on the above datasets reached 90.34%, 80.78% and 93.27% respectively. The accuracy of U2R on the KDDTestC and KDDTest-21 datasets both reached 42.50%. The accuracy of R2L on the KDDTestC and KDDTest-21 datasets reached 54.39% and 52.51%, respectively. And the F1 score on the above datasets reached 91.01%, 87.18% and 93.99% respectively. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

The feature extractor model is based on a convolutional sparse coding network whose sparse encoder is approximated by a regression random forest model according to the principles of knowledge distillation. In this case, an algorithm of growing sparse coding neural gas has been developed for unsupervised training the features extractor with automatic determination of the required number of features on each layer. As for feature extractor, at the training phase to implement of sparse coding the greedy L1-regularized method of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit was used, and at the knowledge distillation phase, the L1-regularized method at the least angles (Least regression algorithm) was additionally used. Due to the explaining-away effect, the extracted features are uncorrelated and robust to noise and adversarial attacks. The proposed feature extractor is unsupervised trained to separate the explanatory factors and allows to use the unlabeled training data, which are usually quite large, with the maximum efficiency. As a model of the decision rules proposed to use the binary encoder of input observations based on an ensemble of decision trees and information-extreme closed hyper-surfaces (containers) for class separation, that are recovery in radial-basis of Hemming’ binary space. The addition of coding trees is based on the boosting principle, and the radius of class containers is optimized by direct search. The information-extreme classifier is characterized by low computational complexity and high generalization capacity for small sets of labeled training data. The verification results of the trained model on open CTU test data sets confirm the suitability of the proposed algorithms for practical application since the accuracy of malware traffic detection is 96.1 %. © 2020.

However, ML models themselves are vulnerable to adversarial examples, generated by deliberately adding subtle perturbation to the input sample that some people are not aware of, causing the model to give a false output with high confidence. In this paper, our goal is to investigate the possibility of stealthy cyber attacks towards IDS, including injection attack, function code attack and reconnaissance attack, and enhance its robustness to adversarial attack. However, adversarial algorithms are subject to communication protocol and legal range of data in ICS, unlike only limited by the distance between original samples and newly generated samples in image domain. We propose two strategies - optimal solution attack and GAN attack - oriented to flexibility and volume of data, formulating an optimization problem to find stealthy attacks, where the former is appropriate for not too large and more flexible samples while the latter provides a more efficient solution for larger and not too flexible samples. Finally, we conduct experiments on a semi-physical ICS testbed with a high detection performance ensemble ML-based detector to show the effectiveness of our attacks.

However, the privacy and security issues of DL have been revealed that the DL model can be stolen or reverse engineered, sensitive training data can be inferred, even a recognizable face image of the victim can be recovered. Besides, the recent works have found that the DL model is vulnerable to adversarial examples perturbed by imperceptible noised, which can lead the DL model to predict wrongly with high confidence. In this paper, we first briefly introduces the four types of attacks and privacy-preserving techniques in DL. We then review and summarize the attack and defense methods associated with DL privacy and security in recent years. To demonstrate that security threats really exist in the real world, we also reviewed the adversarial attacks under the physical condition. Finally, we discuss current challenges and open problems regarding privacy and security issues in DL.

However, existing IDSs suffer from various limitations that include the inability to adapt to changing attack patterns, identify novel attacks, requirements of significant computational resources, and absence of balance between accuracy and false-positive rates (FPR). These shortcomings in current IDSs reduce their effectiveness for deploying in cloud-based application systems. Moreover, most of the cloud IDS researches use conventional network benchmark datasets like NSL-KDD for evaluation, which do not provide the actual picture of their performance in real-world cloud systems. To address these challenges, we propose a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) and prioritized experience replay based adaptive IDS model built for accurate detection of new and complex attacks in cloud platforms. We evaluated our proposed model using a practical cloud-specific intrusion dataset, namely, ISOT-CID and a conventional network-based benchmark dataset (NSL-KDD). The experimental results show better performance than state-of-the-art IDSs along with novel attack detection capabilities. Further, We have used flow-based analysis in our model to ensure low computing resource requirements. Besides, we evaluated the robustness of our model against a black-box adversarial attack resembling a real-life scenario and observed a marginal decrease in the performance. Finally, we demonstrated our model’s usability in a practical use case with frequent changes in the attack pattern. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Black-box adversarial attack; Cyber attacks; Double Deep Q-Network; False positive rate; Intrusion Detection System; ISOT-CID; NSL-KDD","Benchmarking; Computer crime; Cryptography; Deep learning; Intrusion detection; Privacy by design; Reinforcement learning; Benchmark datasets; Cloud-based applications; Computational resources; Computing resource; False positive rates; Flow-based analysis; Intrusion Detection Systems; Security solutions; Network security","Li, Z., Sun, W., Wang, L., A neural network based distributed intrusion detection system on cloud platform (2012) 2012 IEEE 2Nd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems, pp. 75-79. , https://doi.org/10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664371, Hangzhou, pp; Sethi, K., Kumar, R., Prajapati, N., Bera, P., Deep reinforcement learning based intrusion detection system for cloud infrastructure (2020) International Conference on Communication Systems & Networks (COMSNETS), Bengaluru, India, pp. 1-6. , https://doi.org/10.1109/COMSNETS48256.2020.9027452, pp., 2020; Aldribi, A., Traoré, I., Moa, B., Nwamuo, O.: Hypervisor-based cloud intrusion detection through online multivariate statistical change tracking.

Most existing algorithms may be attacked by adversarial examples. An adversarial example is a slightly modified input sample that can lead to a false result of machine learning algorithms. This poses a potential security threat for many machine learning-based applications. Especially in the domain of intrusion detection, the intrusion adversarial examples may result in malicious attacks on intrusion detection classifiers. To our knowledge, all previous work only apply the adversarial examples generation methods in the field of image classification, which is not suitable for network traffic datasets. Aiming at generating more similar intrusion adversarial examples, this paper explores a Constraint-Iteration Fast Gradient Sign Method (C-IFGSM) that can adapt to complex network traffic datasets with multiple types of features and multiple relationship among features. Experiments show that the C-IFGSM based adversarial approach can achieve good performance on intrusion adversarial examples. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adversarial examples; Deep neural network; Feature constraints; Intrusion detection","Classification (of information); Complex networks; Deep learning; Intrusion detection; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Network security; Generation method; Input sample; Malicious attack; Network traffic; Security problems; Security threats; Learning algorithms","Androutsopoulos, I., Koutsias, J., Chandrinos, K.V., Paliouras, G., Spyropou-Los, C.D., An evaluation of naive Bayesian anti-spam filtering (2000) Arxiv Preprint Cs/0006013; Buczak, A.L., Guven, E., A survey of data mining and machine learning methods for cyber security intrusion detection (2015) IEEE Commun.

An anomaly-based intrusion detection system detects abnormal patterns based on deviations from expected normal behaviors; however, such a system has a low detection rate. Also a detection accuracy may vary depending on whether abnormal samples are used during learning. Moreover, it may vary according to the degree of class imbalance that means the imbalance of data class distributions. To avoid the problem and to enhance the low predictive accuracy, it might need to augment minority datasets through the creation of new samples. Therefore, recently, some of existing studies have involved the development of intrusion detection models using machine/deep learning algorithms to overcome the limitations of existing anomaly-based intrusion detection methodologies and to avoid class imbalance problems. In a similar vein, this study proposes a method for improving classification performance of normal and abnormal data in anomaly-based intrusion detection systems by applying data augmentation using GAN. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed anomaly detection method, we use the ADFA-LD Dataset which consists of system call traces for attacks on the latest operating systems. Experiments were performed using SVM (Support Vector Machine) and CNN (Convolution Neural Network) for classification, and GAN and SMOTE for data augmentation, respectively. The experimental results indicated that GAN based approach provides a slightly more reliable way of working with data augmentation than SMOTE. In addition, it was confirmed based on the experimental results that the classification performance can be improved as the number of samples belonging to each imbalanced class increases. © International Research Publication House.","Anomaly detection; Cyber security; GAN; Host based intrusion detection system; Machine / deep learning; System calls",,"Wagner, D., Soto, P., Mimicry Attacks on Host-Based Intrusion Detection Systems (2002) Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS '02), pp. 255-264. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/586110.586145, Washington DC, 18-22 Nov; Scarfone, K.

However, malicious adversaries have strong interests in manipulation the operations of machine learning algorithms to achieve their objectives in gaining financially, injecting injury or disasters. Adversaries against ML can be classified based on their capabilities and goals into two types: Adversary who has full knowledge of the ML models and parameters (white-box scenario) and one that does not have any knowledge and use guessing techniques to figure out the ML model and its parameters (black-box scenario). In both scenarios, the adversaries will attempt to maliciously manipulate model either during training or testing. Defending against these attacks can be successful by following three methods: 1) making the ML model robust to adversary, 2) validating and verifying input, or 3) changing ML architecture. In this paper, we present a resilient machine learning (rML) ensemble against adversarial attacks by dynamically changing the ML architecture and the ML models to be used such that the adversaries have no knowledge about the current ML model being used and consequently stop their attempt to manipulate the ML operations at testing phase. We evaluate the effectiveness of our rML ensemble using the benchmarking, zero-query dataset “DAmageNet” that contains both clean and adversarial image samples. We use three main neural networks in our ensemble that includes VGG16, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101. The experimental results show that our rML can tolerate the adversarial samples and achieve high classification accuracy with small execution time degradation. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adversarial machine learning; Dynamic data driven applications systems; Moving target defense; Resiliency; Resilient decision support","Automation; Decision making; Electronic trading; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Automated systems; Classification accuracy; Critical applications; Decision making process; Financial trading; Intrusion Detection Systems; Malicious adversaries; Testing phase; Machine learning","Dalvi, N., Domingos, P., Sanghai, S., Verma, D., Adversarial classification (2004) Proceedings of the Tenth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 99-108; Biggio, B., Evasion attacks against machine learning at test time (2013) Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases; Goodfellow, I.J., Shlens, J., Szegedy, C., (2014) Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples.

With the deepening of machine learning research, especially the generative adversarial networks (GAN) proposal, the stability of the anomaly detector is put forward for higher requirements. The main focus of this paper is on the security of machine learning based anomaly detectors. In order to detect the robustness of the existing advanced anomaly detection algorithm, we propose an anomaly detector attack framework MACGAN (maintain attack features based on the generative adversarial networks). The MACGAN framework consists of two parts. The first part is used to analyze the attack fields manually. Then, the learning function of GAN in the second part is used to bypass the anomaly detection. Our framework is tested on the latest Kitsune2018 and CICIDS2017 data sets. Experimental results demonstrate the ability to bypass the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. This greatly helps the network security researchers to improve the stability of the detector. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Generative adversarial networks; Machine learning security; Traffic anomaly detection","Anomaly detection; Complex networks; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Adversarial learning; Adversarial networks; Anomaly-detection algorithms; Learning functions; Machine learning research; Network environments; Network intrusion detection; State of the art; Network security","Corona, I., Giacinto, G., Roli, F., Adversarial attacks against intrusion detection systems: taxonomy, solutions and open issues (2013) Inf.

Thus, securing the data, machines (devices), and user’s privacy in cyberspace has become an utmost concern for individuals, business organizations, and national governments. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been widely employed in cybersecurity, for example, intrusion or malware detection and biometric-based user authentication. However, ML algorithms are vulnerable to attacks both in the training and testing phases, which usually leads to remarkable performance decreases and security breaches. Comparatively, limited studies have been conducted to understand the essence and degree of the vulnerabilities of ML techniques against security threats and their defensive mechanisms. It is imperative to systematize recent works related to cybersecurity using ML to seek the attention of researchers, scientists, and engineers. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the works that have been carried out most recently (from 2013 to 2018) on ML in cybersecurity, describing the basics of cyber-attacks and corresponding defenses, the basics of the most commonly used ML algorithms, and proposed ML and data mining schemes for cybersecurity in terms of features, dimensionality reduction, and classification/detection techniques. In this context, this article also provides an overview of adversarial ML, including the security characteristics of deep learning methods. Finally, open issues and challenges in cybersecurity are highlighted and potential future research directions are discussed. © The Author(s) 2020.","adversarial examples; adversarial learning; Cybersecurity;

For protection, collaborative intrusion detection networks (CIDNs) are developed attempting to reach better detection performance than a single detector, by allowing a set of detectors to switch data or information with each other. However, there is a need to implement suitable trust management schemes, with the aim to safeguard such distributed detection networks against insider threats. In the literature, previous studies have indicated that the notion of intrusion sensitivity can be used to enhance the effectiveness of trust management, by highlighting the feedback from expert nodes. In addition, machine learning can be used to assign the value of intrusion sensitivity automatically. In this work, we evaluate the performance of typical supervised learning classifiers in allocating the value of intrusion sensitivity, and figure out some limitations under different data sets. Then we investigate the impact of intrusion sensitivity in a real network environment under adversarial conditions. The results demonstrate that a wrongly assigned sensitivity value may greatly degrade the detection effectiveness of insider attacks. There is a significant need to choose a suitable classifier in allocating the value of intrusion sensitivity in practice. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","collaborative intrusion detection; insider threat; intrusion sensitivity; supervised learning; trust management","Classification (of information); Supervised learning; Detection performance; Distributed detection; Insider Threat; Learning classifiers; Network intrusions; Security threats; Sensitivity values; Trust management; Intrusion detection","Meng, Y., (2011), The practice on using machine learning for network anomaly intrusion detection.

However, these algorithms have recently been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples – inputs that are crafted with the intent of causing a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to misclassify with high confidence. Although a significant amount of work has been done to find robust defence techniques against adversarial examples, they still pose a potential risk. The majority of the proposed attack and defence strategies are tailored to the computer vision domain, in which adversarial examples were first found. In this paper, we consider this issue in the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) domain and extend existing adversarial example crafting algorithms to account for the domain-specific constraints in the feature space. We propose to incorporate information about the difficulty of feature manipulation directly in the optimization function. Additionally, we define a novel measure for attack cost and include it in the assessment of the robustness of DL algorithms. We validate our approach on two benchmark datasets and demonstrate successful attacks against state-of-the-art DL network intrusion detection algorithms. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Adversarial examples; Adversarial robustness; Deep neural networks; Network intrusion detection","Computational efficiency; Data mining; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Extraction; Learning systems; Benchmark datasets; Domain specific; High confidence; Network intrusion detection; Network intrusion detection systems; Optimization function; Potential risks; State of the art; Intrusion detection","Azami, M.E., Lartizien, C., Canu, S., Converting SVDD scores into probability estimates: application to outlier detection (2017) Neurocomputing, 268, pp. 64-75; Carlini, N., (2019) On evaluating adversarial robustness, , arXiv:1902.06705 [cs, stat]; Carlini, N., Wagner, D., (2016) Towards evaluating the robustness of neural networks, , arXiv:1608.04644 [cs]; Carlini, N., Wagner, D., (2017) Adversarial examples are not easily detected: bypassing ten detection methods, , arXiv:1705.07263 [cs]; Dong, B., Wang, X., Comparison deep learning method to traditional methods using for network intrusion detection (2016) 2016 8th IEEE International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN), pp. 581-585. , IEEE; Gao, N., Gao, L., Gao, Q., Wang, H., An intrusion detection model based on deep belief networks (2014) 2014 Second International Conference on Advanced Cloud and Big Data, pp. 247-252; Goodfellow, I.J., Shlens, J., Szegedy, C., (2014) Explaining and harnessing adversarial examples, , arXiv:1412.6572 [cs, stat]; Hartl, A., Bachl, M., Fabini, J., Zseby, T., (2020) Explainability and adversarial robustness for RNNs, , arXiv:1912.09855 [cs, stat]; Hashemi, M.J., Cusack, G., Keller, E., Towards evaluation of NIDSs in adversarial setting (2019) Proceedings of the 3rd ACM CoNEXT Workshop on Big DAta, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for Data Communication Networks-Big-DAMA 2019, pp. 14-21; Hawkins, S., He, H., Williams, G., Baxter, R., Outlier detection using replicator neural networks (2002) DaWaK 2002.

However, recent studies show that machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial examples. This poses new threats to the security-critical applications in cybersecurity. Currently, there is still a short of study on adversarial examples in the domain of cybersecurity. In this paper, we propose a new method known as the brute-force attack method to better evaluate the robustness of the machine learning classifiers in cybersecurity against adversarial examples. The proposed method, which works in a black-box way and covers some shortages of the existing adversarial attack methods based on generative adversarial networks, is simple to implement and only needs the output of the target classifiers to generate adversarial examples. To have a comprehensive evaluation of the attack performance of the proposed method, we use our method to generate adversarial examples against the common machine learning based security systems in cybersecurity including host intrusion detection systems, Android malware detection systems, and network intrusion detection systems. We compare the attack performance of the proposed method against these security systems with that of state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods based on generative adversarial networks. The preliminary experimental results show that the proposed method, which is more efficient in computation and outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods based on generative adversarial networks, can be used to evaluate the robustness of various machine learning based systems in cybersecurity against adversarial examples. © 2013 IEEE.","Adversarial examples; black-box method; deep learning; intrusion detection; machine learning; malware detection; neural networks","Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Malware; Network security; Security systems; Adversarial networks; Black box method; Brute-force attack; Comprehensive evaluation; Host intrusion detection system; Network intrusion detection systems; Security critical applications; State of the art; Learning algorithms","Li, J., Sun, L., Yan, Q., Li, Z., Srisa-An, W., Ye, H., Significant permission identification for machine-learning-based Android malware detection (2018) IEEE Trans.

The existence of these two factors is the main reason for the frequent discovery of information network security problems. Network security depends on the development of information technology. Only the independent and controllable technology can obtain a safe and stable development space. However, network security is the premise of the development of information technology, so we can't go ahead blindly without considering the cost and cost for the development. In the face of safety and risk, we should master a balance point, and take multiple measures such as management, technology and system to control the safety risk in a controllable range. This paper analzye the information network security construction based on depth learning and modulus algorithm. The improved algorithm can be stably controlled within 0.007s in training time. Moreover, as the training difficulty increases, the training time will gradually increase, but the change is not obvious, and the overall tends to be stable. By training neural network with the selected instance and make its maximum close to real system working model or network attack model, thus the input to any of its monitoring data to be able to make quite the right judgment. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

The first dataset was built using a state-of-the-art dataset CDX 2009 that was collected during a cyber defense exercise, while the remaining two datasets were collected by us in 2015 and 2018 using publicly available network services containing buffer overflow and other high severity vulnerabilities. These two datasets contain several adversarial obfuscation techniques that were applied onto malicious as well as legitimate traffic samples during 'the execution' of their TCP network connections. Adversarial obfuscation techniques were used for evading machine learning-based network intrusion detection classifiers. We show that the performance of such classifiers can be improved when partially augmenting their training data by samples obtained from obfuscation techniques. In detail, we utilized tunneling obfuscation in HTTP(S) protocol and non-payload-based obfuscations modifying various properties of network traffic by, e.g., TCP segmentation, re-transmissions, corrupting and reordering of packets, etc. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first collection of network traffic data that contains adversarial techniques and is intended for non-payload-based network intrusion detection and adversarial classification. Provided datasets enable testing of the evasion resistance of arbitrary machine learning-based classifiers. © 2013 IEEE.","adversarial classification; ASNM features; buffer overflow; Dataset; evasions; network intrusion detection; non-payload-based obfuscations; tunneling obfuscations","Hypertext systems; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Network security; Transmission control protocol; Adversarial classifications; Buffer overflows; Cyber defense exercise; Intrusion detectors; Network intrusion detection; Network services; Security networks; State of the art; Classification (of information)","(2019), https://www.mcafee.com/threat-intelligence/ips/top-attacks.aspx, Top Intrusion Attacks.

IoT network is vulnerable to attacks and identification of these malicious behaviours at an early stage can save the data from attacks. The main objective of this work is to build machine learning models to identify attacks in IoT network. To build a model, normal and attack data needs to be generated from the IoT environment. A test bed is build to simulate the IoT environment using Node MCU ESP8266, DHT11 sensor and wireless router. An adversarial system is build using a laptop system which performs actions of sniffing and poisoning attacks. Data captured from the sensors were temperature, humidity and due-point which are transmitted to ThinkSpeak platform using wireless gateway. In the normal phase, sensor values is captured by Node MCU and transmitted to Think Speak server which are stored and labelled as normal data. In the attacking phase, from an adversarial system, the attacker secretly intercepts the data, modifies the data when it is transmitted between the Node MCU and Think Speak server. In the attacking phase, Man in the Middle attack is performed in the network using ARP Poisoning and the data captured is labelled as attack data. Machine learning classifiers such as Naïve Bayes, SVM, decision tree, Adaboost are built to categorize data into normal and attack classes. © 2020 The Authors.

One of the major challenges in using detection systems in practice is in dealing with an overwhelming number of alerts that are triggered by normal behavior (the so-called false positives), obscuring alerts resulting from actual malicious activities. We introduce a novel approach for computing a policy for prioritizing alerts using adversarial reinforcement learning. Our approach assumes that the attacker knows the full state of the detection system and the defender’s alert prioritization policy, and will dynamically choose an optimal attack. The first step of our approach is to capture the interaction between the defender and attacker in a game theoretic model. To tackle the computational complexity of solving this game to obtain a dynamic stochastic alert prioritization policy, we propose an adversarial reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, we use neural reinforcement learning to compute best response policies for both the defender and the adversary to an arbitrary stochastic policy of the other. We then use these in a double-oracle framework to obtain an approximate equilibrium of the game, which in turn yields a robust stochastic policy for the defender. We use case studies in network intrusion and fraud detection to demonstrate that our approach is effective in creating robust alert prioritization policies.1 Copyright © 2020, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Anomaly-based method and signature-based method are the traditional approaches used for network intrusion detection. The signature-based approach can only detect familiar attacks whereas the anomaly-based approach shows promising results in detecting new unknown attacks. Machine Learning (ML) based approaches have been studied in the past for anomaly-based NIDS. In recent years, the Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have been widely utilized for intrusion detection due to its capability to obtain optimal feature representation automatically. Even though DL based approaches improves the accuracy of the detection tremendously, they are prone to adversarial attacks. The attackers can trick the model to wrongly classify the adversarial samples into a particular target class. In this paper, the performance analysis of several ML and DL models are carried out for intrusion detection in both adversarial and non-adversarial environment. The models are trained on the NSLKDD dataset which contains a total of 148,517 data points. The robustness of several models against adversarial samples is studied. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Adversarial attacks; Cyber security; Deep learning; Intrusion detection; Machine learning","Deep learning; Adversarial environments; Feature representation; Intrusion detection models; Network intrusion detection; Network intrusion detection systems; Performance analysis; Signature-based approach; Traditional approaches; Intrusion detection","Tavallaee, M., Bagheri, E., Lu, W., Ghorbani, A.A., A detailed analysis of the KDD CUP 99 data set (2009) 2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Security and Defense Applications, pp. 1-6. , pp., IEEE, July; Anderson, J.P., (1980) Computer Security Threat Monitoring and Surveillance, , James P.

However, new traffic obfuscation techniques have been developed to thwart classification. Traffic mutation is one such obfuscation technique, that consists of modifying the flow’s statistical characteristics to mislead the traffic classifier. In fact, this same technique can also be used to hide normal traffic characteristics for the sake of privacy. However, the concern is its use by attackers to bypass intrusion detection systems by modifying the attack traffic characteristics. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised Deep Learning (DL)-based model to detect mutated traffic. This model is based on generative DL architectures, namely Autoencoders (AE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). This model consists of a denoising AE to de-anonymize the mutated traffic and a discriminator to detect it. The implementation results show that the traffic can be denoised when different mutation techniques are applied with a reconstruction error less than 10. In addition, the detection rate of fake traffic reaches 83.7%. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Autoencoder; Deep Learning; Generative Adversarial Network; IoT; Machine Learning; Network security; Obfuscation; Traffic classification","Deep learning; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Adversarial networks; Internet of thing (IOT); Intrusion Detection Systems; Reconstruction error; Statistical characteristics; Traffic characteristics; Traffic classification; Traffic obfuscations; Learning systems","https://dpkt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/; https://www.tensorflow.org; Alom, M.Z., Taha, T.M., Network intrusion detection for cyber security using unsupervised deep learning approaches (2017) 2017 IEEE National Aerospace and Electronics Conference (NAECON), pp. 63-69; Baddar, S.A.H., Merlo, A., Migliardi, M., Behavioral-anomaly detection in forensics analysis (2019) IEEE Secur.

Cost effectiveness is a direct consequence of a correct estimation of resource usage, to be able to define a budget and estimate the right price to put own services on the market. Attacks that overload resources with non legitimate requests, being them explicit attacks or just malicious, non harmful resource engagements, may push the use of Cloud resources beyond estimation, causing additional costs, or unexpected energy usage, or a lower overall quality of services, so intrusion detection devices or firewalls are set to avoid undesired accesses. We propose the use of Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs) to setup a method for shaping request based attacks capable of reaching resources beyond defenses. The approach is studied by using a publicly available traffic data set, to test the concept and demonstrate its potential applications. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cloud; Deep learning; Energy attacks; Generative Adversarial Networks; Microservices; Security; Serverless; Service degradation; Software services","Budget control; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Intrusion detection; Statistical tests; Additional costs; Cloud infrastructures; Cost effective; Online resources; Remote resources; Resource usage; Software systems; Third parties; Cost estimating","Amato, F., Mazzeo, A., Moscato, V., Picariello, A., (2009) Semantic Management of Multimedia Documents for E-Government Activity, pp. 1193-1198. , https://doi.org/10.1109/CISIS.2009.195; Amato, F., Moscato, V., Picariello, A., Piccialli, F., SOS: A multimedia recommender system for online social networks (2019) Future Gen.

The Controller Area Network (CAN bus), a robust vehicle bus standard, allows microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other. The community has seen many security breach examples that exploit CAN functionalities and other in-vehicle flaws. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) on in-vehicle network are advantageous in monitoring CAN traffic and suspicious activities. Whereas, existing IDSs on in-vehicle network only support one or two attack models, and identifying abnormal in-vehicle CAN traffic against diversified attack models with better performance is more expected as can be then implemented practically. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system that can detect many different attacks. The method analyzes the CAN traffic generated by the in-vehicle network in real time and identifies the abnormal state of the vehicle practically. Our proposal fuses the autoencoder trick to the SVM model. More precisely, we introduce to the system an autoencoder that learns to compress CAN traffic data into extracted features (which can be uncompressed to closely match the original data). Then, the support vector machine is trained on the features to detect abnormal traffic. We show detailed model parameter configuration by adopting several concrete attacks. Experimental results demonstrate better detection performance (than existing proposals). © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Autoencoder; In-vehicle network; Intrusion detection systems","Control system synthesis; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Network architecture; Network security; Parallel architectures; Support vector machines; Vehicles; Auto encoders; Controller area network; Detect abnormal traffic; Detection performance; Different attacks; In-vehicle networks; Internal communications; Intrusion Detection Systems; Computer crime","Woo, S., Jo, H.J., Lee, D.H., A practical wireless attack on the connected car and security protocol for in-vehicle CAN (2015) IEEE Trans.

We embed adversary models and intrusion detection systems (IDS) inside a CANoe based application. Based on real-world CAN traces collected from several vehicles we build attack traces that are subject to intrusion detection algorithms. We also take benefit from existing machine-learning support in MATLAB that is ported via C++ code in CANoe in order to integrate intrusion detection functionality. A unified framework for attacks and intrusion detection has the benefit of providing a testbed for various intrusion detection algorithms. CANoe integration makes the use of these functionalities ready for realistic testing as CANoe is an industry-standard tool in the automotive domain. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","CAN bus; Intrusion detection; Vehicle security","C++ (programming language); Computer crime; Control system synthesis; Integration testing; Network security; Signal detection; Vehicles; Automotive domains; CAN bus; Controller area network; In-vehicle networks; Industry standards; Intrusion detection algorithms; Intrusion Detection Systems; Vehicle security; Intrusion detection","Al-Jarrah, O.Y., Maple, C., Dianati, M., Oxtoby, D., Mouzakitis, A., Intrusion detection systems for intra-vehicle networks: A review (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 21266-21289; Alshammari, A., Zohdy, M.A., Debnath, D., Corser, G., Classification approach for intrusion detection in vehicle systems (2018) Wirel.

With the growing pace at which new attacks are developed, conventional signature based attack detection methods are often not enough, and machine learning poses as a potential solution. Adversarial machine learning is a research area that examines both the generation and detection of adversarial examples, which are inputs specially crafted to deceive classifiers, and has been extensively studied specifically in the area of image recognition, where minor modifications are performed on images that cause a classifier to produce incorrect predictions. However, in other fields, such as intrusion and malware detection, the exploration of such methods is still growing. The aim of this survey is to explore works that apply adversarial machine learning concepts to intrusion and malware detection scenarios. We concluded that a wide variety of attacks were tested and proven effective in malware and intrusion detection, although their practicality was not tested in intrusion scenarios. Adversarial defenses were substantially less explored, although their effectiveness was also proven at resisting adversarial attacks. We also concluded that, contrarily to malware scenarios, the variety of datasets in intrusion scenarios is still very small, with the most used dataset being greatly outdated. © 2013 IEEE.","adversarial machine learning; Cybersecurity; intrusion detection; malware detection","Computer system firewalls; Image recognition; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Attack detection; Computing system; Cyber security; Information age; Intrusion scenarios; Malware detection; Systematic Review; Malware","https://www.alexa.com, Alexa Top 1m.

SAVAER is a supervised variational auto-encoder with regularization, which uses WGAN-GP instead of the vanilla GAN to learn the latent distribution of the original data. SAVAER's decoder is used to synthesize samples of low-frequent and unknown attacks, thereby increasing the diversity of training samples and balancing the training data set. SAVAER's encoder is used to initialize the weights of the hidden layers of the DNN and explore high-level feature representations of the original samples. The benchmark NSL-KDD (KDDTest+), NSL-KDD (KDDTest-21) and UNSW-NB15 datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The experimental results show that the proposed SAVAER-DNN is more suitable for data augmentation than the other three well-known data oversampling methods. Moreover, the proposed SAVAER-DNN outperforms eight well-known classification models in detection performance and is more effective in detecting low-frequent and unknown attacks. Furthermore, compared with other state-of-the-art intrusion detection models reported in the IDS literature, the proposed SAVAER-DNN offers better performance in terms of overall accuracy, detection rate, F1 score, and false positive rate. © 2013 IEEE.","deep learning; Intrusion detection; regularization; supervised adversarial variational auto-encoder; WGAN-GP","Benchmarking; Deep learning; Learning systems; Network coding; Network security; Adversarial learning; Auto encoders; Classification models; Detection performance; False positive rates; Intrusion detection models; Network intrusion detection; regularization; Intrusion detection","(2019) Top Dutch Banks Revenue Service Hit by Cyber Attacks, , https://www.securityweek.com/top-dutch-banks-hit-cyber-attacks, Accessed: Dec. 12, [Online]; (2019) Hackers Hit Norsk Hydro with Ransomware, , https://www.autonews.com/suppliers/norsk-hydro-rebuilds-after-cyberattack, Accessed: Oct. 10.

In this paper, we propose an MCTS-T algorithm for generating adversarial examples of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks based on Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm. The MCTS algorithm enables the generation model to provide a reward value that reflects the probability of generative examples bypassing the detector. To guarantee the antagonism and feasibility of the generative adversarial examples, the bypassing rules are restricted. The experimental results indicate that the missed detection rate of adversarial examples is significantly improved after the MCTS-T generation algorithm. Additionally, we construct a generative adversarial network (GAN) to optimize the detector and improve the detection rate when dealing with adversarial examples. After several epochs of adversarial training, the accuracy of detecting adversarial examples is significantly improved. © 2013 IEEE.","convolutional neural networks; generative adversarial network; Monte Carlo tree; Network intrusion detection","Deep learning; Monte Carlo methods; Neural networks; Trees (mathematics); Adversarial networks; Convolutional neural network; Cross-site scripting; Detection rates; Generation algorithm; Missed detections; Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS); Network intrusion detection; Intrusion detection","Hinton, G.E., Reducing the dimensionality of data with neural networks (2006) Science, 313 (5786), pp. 504-507. , Jul; Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Proc.

However, it is difficult to detect a small number of attack traffic when the real network is connected to produce an imbalance between the attack traffic class data and the normal traffic data necessary for learning. In this study, we propose a method to improve the accuracy of attack traffic data detection by creating similar attack traffic, using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) algorithm of deep learning. The proposed method generates similar attack traffic for NSL–KDD, ISCX 2012, and USTC_TFC 2016 datasets, which are well-known intrusion detection learning data sets.

Such a vision now seems attainable thanks in large part to the progress in the field of machine learning (ML), which has now already disrupted a number of industries and revolutionized practically all fields of research. But are the ML models foolproof and robust to security attacks to be in charge of managing the network? Unfortunately, many modern ML models are easily misled by simple and easily-crafted adversarial perturbations, which does not bode well for the future of ML-based cognitive networks unless ML vulnerabilities for the cognitive networking environment are identified, addressed, and fixed. The purpose of this article is to highlight the problem of unsecure ML and to sensitize the readers to the danger of adversarial ML by showing how an easily crafted adversarial ML example can compromise the operations of the cognitive self-driving network. In this article, we demonstrate adversarial attacks on two simple yet representative cognitive networking applications (namely, intrusion detection and network traffic classification). We also provide some guidelines to design secure ML models for cognitive networks that are robust to adversarial attacks on the ML pipeline of cognitive networks. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Communication channels (information theory); Data structures; Digital storage; Intrusion detection; Job analysis; Machine learning; Personnel training; Perturbation techniques; Pipelines; Telemetering; Achilles' heel; Cognitive network; Cognitive networkings; Network traffic classification; Perturbation method; Security; Security attacks; Task analysis; Network security","Feamster, N., Rexford, J., (2017) Why (And How) Networks Should Run Themselves, , preprint; Goodfellow, I., McDaniel, P., Papernot, N., Making machine learning robust against adversarial inputs (2018) Commun.

Different from the traditional generative adversary network (GAN), the model adds constraints to the discriminator and generator respectively to limit the degree of convergence freedom, so as to accelerate the effect of convergence. It almost completely retains the advantages of GAN and has a certain degree of optimization. The experimental results show that the network intrusion detection model based on CGAN method has obvious advantages in terms of accuracy, false alarm rate and real rate. © 2019 ACM.","Conditional Generative Adversarial Network; Limited Degree of Convergence Freedom; Network Intrusion Detection; Optimization Model","Deep learning; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Adversarial networks; Convergence speed; Degree of convergence; High Degree of Freedom; Intrusion detection models; Learning technology; Network intrusion detection; Optimization modeling; Intrusion detection","Kanaoka, A., Okamoto, E., Multivariate statistical analysis of network traffic for intrusion detection (2003) 14th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications, 2003.

As a result, anomaly-based NIDSs, built on neural networks, are beginning to receive attention due to their ability to seek out new attacks. However, it has been shown that neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial example attacks in other domains. But, previously proposed anomaly-based NIDSs have not been evaluated in such adversarial settings. In this paper, we show how to evaluate an anomaly-based NIDS trained on network traffic in the face of adversarial inputs. We show how to craft adversarial inputs in the highly constrained network domain, and we evaluate 3 recently proposed NIDSs in an adversarial setting. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

First, we investigate generic off-the-shelf adversarial attacks to test the robustness of DDoS defenses in SDN. Then, we propose Flow-Merge for realistic adversarial flows while achieving a high evasion rate. The evaluation shows that the proposed Flow-Merge is able to force the DL-based DDoS defenses to misclassify 100% of benign flows as malicious. © 2019 held by the owner/author(s).","Adversarial Attacks; Deep Learning; Distributed Denial of Service; Intrusion Detection","Deep learning; Intrusion detection; Network security; Software defined networking; Adversarial Attacks; Adversarial learning; DDoS detection; Distributed denial of service; Distributed denial of service defense; Software defined networking (SDN); Denial-of-service attack","Abusnaina, A., Khormali, A., Alasmary, H., Park, J., Anwar, A., Mohaisen, A., Adversarial learning attacks on graph-based IoT malware detection systems (2019) Proceedings of the 39th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems, ICDCS; Abusnaina, A., Khormali, A., Nyang, D., Yuksel, M., Mohaisen, A., Examining the robustness of learning-based DDoS detection in software defined networks (2019) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Dependable and Secure Computing (IDSC 2019); Kalkan, K., Gur, G., Alagoz, F., Defense mechanisms against DDoS attacks in SDN environment (2017) IEEE Communications Magazine, 55 (9), pp. 175-179. , September 2017; Moosavi-Dezfooli, S.-M., Fawzi, A., Frossard, P., Deepfool: A simple and accurate method to fool deep neural networks (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 2574-2582; Niyaz, Q., Sun, W., Javaid, A.Y., A deep learning based DDoS detection system in software-defined networking (SDN) (2017) ICST Transactions on Security and Safety, , 2017; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P.D., Jha, S., Fredrikson, M., Berkay Celik, Z., Swami, A., The limitations of deep learning in adversarial settings (2016) Proceedings of the IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 372-387; Schehlmann, L., Abt, S., Baier, H., Blessing or curse?

A method of reimagining cyber attacks as free sources of live training data for machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDSes) is proposed and evaluated. Rather than aborting attacks against legitimate services, adversarial interactions are selectively prolonged to maximize the defender’s harvest of useful threat intelligence. Enhancing web services with deceptive attack-responses in this way is shown to be a powerful and practical strategy for improved detection, addressing several perennial challenges for machine learning-based IDS in the literature, including scarcity of training data, the high labeling burden for (semi-)supervised learning, encryption opacity, and concept differences between honeypot attacks and those against genuine services. By reconceptualizing software security patches as feature extraction engines, the approach conscripts attackers as free penetration testers, and coordinates multiple levels of the software stack to achieve fast, automatic, and accurate labeling of live web data streams. Prototype implementations are showcased for two feature set models to extract security-relevant network- and system-level features from servers hosting enterprise-grade web applications. The evaluation demonstrates that the extracted data can be fed back into a network-level IDS for exceptionally accurate, yet lightweight attack detection. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Datasets;

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) performance depends on multiple factors like accuracy, false positive rate, precision, recall, and f-score, also capability to detect new and stealthy attacks. An IDS must have this capability. In this paper, to achieve highly accurate results, the proposed approach focuses on feature selection using training functions. The data set used for experimentation is CICIDS-2017(Friday). However, the time required to train and test the model is very high and also accuracy is comparably less. To address this, this paper proposed a machine learning classifier based feature selection approach, in which features are selected by considering training time, testing time and accuracy of the model built. In this proposed approach original 82 feature size is reduced to 15 features with providing good accuracy than earlier in less time. © 2019 IEEE.","accuracy; decision tree; feature selection; intrusion detection system","Decision trees; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Network security; Turing machines; Classification results; False positive rates; Highly accurate; Intrusion Detection Systems; Multiple factors; Performance based; Training function; Training time; Feature extraction","(2018), https://internetworldstats.com/stats.htm, Internet World Stats Usage and Population Statistics last accessed on 27 Feb 2019; Jang-Jaccard, J., Nepal, S., A survey of emerging threats in cybersecurity (2014) Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 80 (5), pp. 973-993; Aghdam, M.H., Kabiri, P., Feature selection for intrusion detection system using ant colony optimization (2016) Ij Network Security, 18 (3), pp. 420-432; Alazab, A., Hobbs, M., Abawajy, J., Alazab, M., Using feature selection for intrusion detection system (2012) 2012 International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT), Gold Coast, QLD, 2012, pp. 296-301; Yousef, A., Goran, K., Slavko, G., Zoran, J., Flow-based anomaly intrusion detection system using two neural network stages (2014) Computer Science and Information Systems, 11, pp. 601-622; Su, M., Real-time anomaly detection systems for Denial-of-Service attacks by weighted k-nearestneighbor classifiers (2011) Expert System with Application, 38, pp. 3492-3498; Srinivas, M., Sung, A.H., Feature ranking and selection for intrusion detection systems using support vector machines (2002) Proceedings of the Second Digital Forensic Research Workshop, pp. 1-10; Wei, W., Gombault, S., Guyet, T., Towards fast detecting intrusions: Using key attributes of network traffic (2008) 2008 the Third International Conference on Internet Monitoring and Protection, pp. 86-91; Sharafaldin, I., Habibi Lashkari, A., Ghorbani, A.A., Toward generating a new intrusion detection dataset and intrusion traffic characterization (2018) 4th International Conference on Information Systems Security and Privacy (ICISSP), Purtogal, pp. 108-116; Panigrahi, R., Borah, S., A detailed analysis of cicids2017 dataset for designing intrusion detection systems (2018) International Journal of Engineering & Technology, 7 (324), pp. 479-482",,"Patil S.B.Nawgaje D.D.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728119014,,,"English","Proceeding - Int.

WiFi-based systems have achieved high accuracy, but with limitations in dataset collection consumptions and feature extractions. In this paper, we propose EPID, a scheme for Encryption Policy Intrusion Detection leveraging Channel State Information (CSI). EPID applies Butterworth low-pass filter for signal denoising, and conjugate calibration to remove CSI random phase offsets. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based data augmentation approach is proposed to augment dataset. Besides, sparse autoencoder (SAE) is adopted for feature extraction to reduce computational complexity and mistaken detection risks caused by redundant statistics. Based on the features, one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) is conducted for general intrusion detection. Extensive empirical evidence shows that EPID yields mean 96.6% detection accuracy with practical feasibility. © 2019 IEEE.","CSI; Data augmentation; Feature extraction; Intrusion detection","Butterworth filters; Channel state information; Cryptography; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Low pass filters; Support vector machines; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Adversarial networks; Data augmentation; Detection accuracy; One-class support vector machine; Privacy concerns; Safety applications; Vision-based solutions; Wearable devices; Intrusion detection","Tanabe, R., Cao, M., Murao, T., Hashimoto, H., Vision based object recognition of mobile robot with kinect 3d sensor in indoor environment (2012) 2012 Proceedings of SICE Annual Conference (SICE), IEEE, pp. 2203-2206; Guo, Y., Guo, X., Wang, G., Using RFID in localization for indoor navigation of mobile robots (2017) 2012 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation, IEEE, pp. 1892-1897; Gopal, R., Parthasarathy, V., Hbsids: Human body sensor based intrusion detection system in a cooperative network (2014) 2014International Conference on Science Engineering and Management Research (ICSEMR), IEEE, pp. 1-4; Tang, K., Xu, Y., Guo, W., An indoor human motion detection algorithm based on channel state information (2017) 2017 International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2), IEEE, pp. 1-6; Xiao, J., Wu, K., Yi, Y., Fimd: Fine-grained device-free motion detection (2012) 2012 IEEE 18th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems, IEEE Computer Society, pp. 229-235. , Singapore; Qian, K., Wu, C., Yang, Z., Liu, Y., Zhou, Z., Pads: Passive detection of moving targets with dynamic speed using phy layer information (2014) 2014 20th IEEE International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS), IEEE, pp. 1-8; Gu, Y., Zhan, J., Ji, Y., Li, J., Ren, F., Gao, S., Mosense: An rfbased motion detection system via off-the-shelf wifi devices (2017) IEEE Internet of Things Journal, IEEE, 4 (6), pp. 2326-2341; Zhou, Q., Xing, J., Chen, W., From signal to image: Enabling fine-grained gesture recognition with commercial wi-fi devices (2018) Sensors, 18 (9), p. 3142; Fu, Y., Peng, M., Zhou, Q.F., Aaog: Anti-addiction on online gaming leveraging csi from commodity wifi devices (2017) 2017 IEEE 86th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall), IEEE, pp. 1-6; Xi, W., Electronic frog eye: Counting crowd using wifi (2014) IEEE INFOCOM 2014-IEEE Conference on Computer Communications, IEEE, pp. 361-369; Kosba, A.E., Youssef, M., Rasid demo: A robust wlan device-free passive motion detection system (2012) 2012 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops, IEEE, pp. 531-533; Jin, Y., Tian, Z., Zhou, M., Li, Z., Zhang, Z., A whole-home level intrusion detection system using wifi-enabled iot (2018) 2018 14th International Wireless Communications & Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC), IEEE, pp. 494-499; Halperin, D., Hu, W., Sheth, A., Tool release: Gathering 802. 11n traces with channel state information (2011) ACM Sigcomm Computer Communication Review, ACM, 41 (1), p. 53; Goodfellow, I.J., Pouget-Abadie, J., Mirza, M., Generative adversarial nets (2014) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2672-2680; Shmelkov, K., Schmid, C., Alahari, K., How good is my gan (2018) The European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), ACM, pp. 213-229",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728147437,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Unfortunately, traditional predictive analytics or machine learning techniques that require training data of known attack strategies are not practical, given the scarcity of representative data and the evolving nature of cyberattacks. This paper describes the design and evaluation of a novel automated system, ASSERT, which continuously synthesizes and separates cyberattack behavior models to enable better prediction of future actions. It takes streaming malicious event evidences as inputs, abstracts them to edge-based behavior aggregates, and associates the edges to attack models, where each represents a unique and collective attack behavior. It follows a dynamic Bayesian-based model generation approach to determine when a new attack behavior is present, and creates new attack models by maximizing a cluster validity index. ASSERT generates empirical attack models by separating evidences and use the generated models to predict unseen future incidents. It continuously evaluates the quality of the model separation and triggers a re-clustering process when needed. Through the use of 2017 National Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition data, this work demonstrates the effectiveness of ASSERT in terms of the quality of the generated empirical models and the predictability of future actions using the models. © 2019, The Author(s).","Clustering KL divergence; Cyber security; Dynamic bayesian classifier","Automation; Clustering algorithms; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Network security; Quality control; Separation; Attack strategies; Automated systems; Cluster validity indices; Design and evaluations; Enterprise networks; Machine learning techniques; Penetration testing; Re-clustering process; Predictive analytics","Al-Mohannadi, H., Mirza, Q., Namanya, A., Awan, I., Cullen, A., Disso, J., Cyber-attack modeling analysis techniques: An overview (2016) Proceedings of the 4Th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud Workshops, pp. 69-76. , https://doi.org/10.1109/W-FiCloud.2016.29/W-FiCloud.2016.29, Vienna; Bilge, L., Han, Y., Dell’Amico, M., Riskteller: Predicting the risk of cyber incidents (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), pp. 1299-1311. , https://doi.org/10.1145/3133956.3134022, ACM, New York; Bolzoni, D., Etalle, S., Hartel, P.H., Panacea: Automating attack classification for anomaly-based network intrusion detection systems (2009) Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection.

As IoT, 5G and AI continue to converge to realize the promise of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), security incidents and events on IoT networks have increased. Deep learning techniques are being applied to detect and mitigate many of such security threats against IoT networks. Feed- forward Neural Networks (FNN) have been widely used for classifying intrusion attacks in IoT networks. In this paper, we consider a variant of the FNN known as the Self-normalizing Neural Network (SNN) and compare its performance with the FNN for classifying intrusion attacks in an IoT network. Our analysis is performed using the BoT- IoT dataset from the Cyber Range Lab of the center of UNSW Canberra Cyber. In our experimental results, the FNN outperforms the SNN for intrusion detection in IoT networks based on multiple performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall as well as multi-classification metrics such as Cohen Cappaâ™s score. However, when tested for adversarial robustness, the SNN demonstrates better resilience against the adversarial samples from the IoT dataset, presenting a promising future in the quest for safer and more secure deep learning in IoT networks. © 2019 IEEE.","Adversarial samples; Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN); Internet of things (IoT); Intrusion Detection; Resilience; Self-normalizing Neural Networks (SNN)","5G mobile communication systems; Deep learning; Feedforward neural networks; Industry 4.0; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Industrial revolutions; Internet of Things (IOT); Learning techniques; Multi-classification; Performance metrics; Resilience; Security application; Self-normalizing Neural Networks (SNN); Network security","Roman, R., Najera, P., Lopez, J., Securing the internet of things (2011) IEEE Computer, 44 (9), pp. 51-58; Javaid, A., Niyaz, Q., Sun, W., Alam, M., A deep learning approach for network intrusion detection system (2016) Proceedings of the 9th EAI International Conference on Bio-inspired Information and Communications Technologies (Formerly BIONETICS), pp. 21-26. , ICST; Guo, W., Mu, D., Xu, J., Su, P., Wang, G., Xing, X., Lemna: Explaining deep learning based security applications (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 364-379. , ACM; Szegedy, C., Zaremba, W., Sutskever, I., Bruna, J., Erhan, D., Goodfellow, I.J., Fergus, R., Intriguing properties of neural networks (2014) ICLR, , abs/1312.6199; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Jha, S., Fredrikson, M., Celik, Z.B., Swami, A., The limitations of deep learning in adversarial settings (2016) 2016 IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P), pp. 372-387. , IEEE; Wang, Z., Deep learning-based intrusion detection with adversaries (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 38367-38384; Klambauer, G., Unterthiner, T., Mayr, A., Hochreiter, S., Selfnormalizing neural networks (2017) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 971-980; Koroniotis, N., Moustafa, N., Sitnikova, E., Turnbull, B., (2018) Towards the Development of Realistic Botnet Dataset in the Internet of Things for Network Forensic Analytics: Bot-iot Dataset, , arXiv preprint arXiv: 1811.00701; Hodo, E., Bellekens, X., Hamilton, A., Dubouilh, P.-L., Iorkyase, E., Tachtatzis, C., Atkinson, R., Threat analysis of iot networks using artificial neural network intrusion detection system (2016) 2016 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC), pp. 1-6. , IEEE; Warzyński, A., Kolaczek, G., Intrusion detection systems vulnerability on adversarial examples (2018) 2018 Innovations in Intelligent Systems and Applications (INISTA), pp. 1-4. , IEEE; Goodfellow, I.J., Shlens, J., Szegedy, C., Explaining and harnessing adversarial examples (2015) CoRR, , abs/1412.6572; Kurakin, A., Goodfellow, I., Bengio, S., Adversarial machine learning at scale (2017) ICLR; Madry, A., Makelov, A., Schmidt, L., Tsipras, D., Vladu, A., Towards deep learning models resistant to adversarial attacks (2018) International Conference on Learning Representations; (2018) Colaboratory: Frequently Asked Questions, , Google,.

Although using the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) as a solution is helpful to some degree, there is an unsolved problem; the low performance of IDS due to lack of enough attack data. Recent approaches to solving this problem use an unsupervised deep learning-based technique called Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Because GAN variants show great performance in image augmentation, some research tries to apply GANs to cyberspace by domain conversion from binary to image. However, the attribute of cyberspace benchmarks is different from that of images. In this paper, we propose using sequence-based generative models such as Sequence Generative Adversarial Nets (SeqGAN) and Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) to augment the ADFA-LD dataset, a sequence call based benchmark. Experimental results show that the performance is better when training ADFA-LD with augmented data from SeqGAN and Seq2Seq than training only the original dataset. © 2019 IEEE.","ADFA-LD; Cyber dataset augmentation; Seq2Seq; SeqGAN","Binary images; Computers; Deep learning; Intrusion detection; Network security; ADFA-LD; Adversarial networks; Cyber dataset augmentation; Domain conversion; Intentional Attacks; Intrusion Detection Systems; Seq2Seq; SeqGAN; Learning systems","Skopik, F., Settanni, G., Fiedler, R., Friedberg, I., Semi-synthetic data set generation for security software evaluation (2014) 2014 Twelfth Annual International Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust.

The security of an IoT network is essentially paramount to the security of the underlying computing and communication infrastructure. However, due to constrained resources and limited computational capabilities, IoT networks are prone to various attacks. Thus, safeguarding the IoT network from adversarial attacks is of vital importance and can be realised through planning and deployment of effective security controls; one such control being an intrusion detection system. In this paper, we present a novel intrusion detection scheme for IoT networks that classifies traffic flow through the application of deep learning concepts. We adopt a newly published IoT dataset and generate generic features from the field information in packet level. We develop a feed-forward neural networks model for binary and multi-class classification including denial of service, distributed denial of service, reconnaissance and information theft attacks against IoT devices. Results obtained through the evaluation of the proposed scheme via the processed dataset illustrate a high classification accuracy. © 2019 IEEE.","Denial of Service Attacks; Feed Forward Neural Networks; Internet of Thing; Intrusion Detection","Classification (of information); Deep learning; Denial-of-service attack; Electric power transmission networks; Feedforward neural networks; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Classification accuracy; Communication infrastructure; Computational capability; Distributed denial of service; Internet of Things (IOT); Intrusion detection scheme; Intrusion Detection Systems; Multi-class classification; Network security","Bera, A., (2019) 80 Mind-Blowing IoT Statisitics (Infographic), , https://safeatlast.co/blog/iot-statistics/, February, accessed on 2019-07-11; Chernyshev, M., Baig, Z.A., Bello, O., Zeadally, S., Internet of Things (IoT): Research, simulators, and testbeds (2018) IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 5, pp. 1637-1647; (2019), http://mqtt.org/, MQTT, April, accessed on 2019-07-11; Kumari, V.V., Varma, P.R.K., A semi-supervised intrusion detection system using active learning SVM and fuzzy c-means clustering (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 International Conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) (I-SMAC), pp. 481-485; Alhakami, W., Alharbi, A., Bourouis, S., Alroobaea, R., Bouguila, N., Network anomaly intrusion detection using a nonparametric Bayesian approach and feature selection (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 52181-52190; Hoang, D.H., Nguyen, H.D., A PCA-based method for IoT network traffic anomaly detection (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 20th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT), pp. 381-386; Zhang, Y., Li, P., Wang, X., Intrusion detection for IoT based on improved genetic algorithm and deep belief network (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 31711-31722; Shin, S., Kobara, K., Chuang, C., Huang, W., A security framework for MQTT (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS), pp. 432-436; Andy, S., Rahardjo, B., Hanindhito, B., Attack scenarios and security analysis of MQTT communication protocol in IoT system (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 4th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Informatics (EECSI), pp. 1-6; Firdous, S.N., Baig, Z., Valli, C., Ibrahim, A., Modelling and evaluation of malicious attacks against the IoT MQTT protocol (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things (IThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData), pp. 748-755; Haddadi, F., Khanchi, S., Shetabi, M., Derhami, V., Intrusion detection and attack classification using feed-forward neural network (2010) Proceedings of the 2010 Second International Conference on Computer and Network Technology, pp. 262-266; McHugh, J., Testing intrusion detection systems: A critique of the 1998 and 1999 DARPA intrusion detection system evaluations as performed by lincoln laboratory (2000) ACM Transactions on Information and System Security, 3 (4), pp. 262-294; Kumar, P.A.R., Selvakumar, S., Distributed denial of service attack detection using an ensemble of neural classifier (2011) Computer Communications, 34 (11), pp. 1328-1341; Amma, N.G.B., Selvakumar, S., Deep radial intelligence with cumulative incarnation approach for detecting denial of service attacks (2019) Neurocomputing, 340, pp. 294-308; Tavallaee, M., Bagheri, E., Lu, W., Ghorbani, A.A., A detailed analysis of the KDD CUP 99 data set (2009) Proceedings of the 2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Security and Defense Applications, pp. 1-6; Moustafa, N., Slay, J., The evaluation of network anomaly detection systems: Statistical analysis of the UNSW-NB15 data set and the comparison with the KDD99 data set (2016) Information Security Journal: A Global Perspective, 25 (1-3), pp. 18-31; Shone, N., Ngc, T.N., Phai, V.D., Shi, Q., A deep learning approach to network intrusion detection (2018) IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence, 2, pp. 41-50; Al-Zewairi, M., Almajali, S., Awajan, A., Experimental evaluation of a multi-layer feed-forward artificial neural network classifier for network intrusion detection system (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 International Conference on New Trends in Computing Sciences (ICTCS), pp. 167-172; Koroniotis, N., Moustafa, N., Sitnikova, E., Turnbull, B., (2018) Towards the Development of Realistic Botnet Dataset in the Internet of Things for Network Forensic Analytics: Bot-IoT Dataset, , eprint arXiv: 1811.00701",,,"IEEE Computer Society",15410110,9781728149615,,,"English","Proc.

Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) based deep learning such as convolutional neural network (CNN) have reached a very high detection rate. But we propose DoS-WGAN, a common architecture that uses the Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGAN) with gradient penalty technology to evade network traffic Classifiers. To camouflage offensive denial of service (DoS) attack traffic as normal network traffic, DoS-WGAN automatically synthesizes attack traces that can defeat a existing NIDS/network security defense for DoS cases. Information entropy is used to measure the dispersing performance of generated DoS attack traffic. The generated DoS attack traffic is so similar to the normal traffic that detection algorithm cannot distinguish between them. When we input the generated DoS attack traffic to a NIDS based on CNN in our experiments, the detection rate drops to 47.6 % from 97.3 %. To make the training more stable, we integrate the Standardized Euclidean distance and the information entropy to evaluate the training process. We believe that AI technology will play a particularly important role in the game of network attack and defense. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Generative adversarial networks; Network intrusion detection systems; Wasserstein-GAN","Deep learning; Intrusion detection; Motion pictures; Network security; Neural networks; Personal computing; Adversarial networks; Artificial intelligence technologies; Convolutional neural network; Detection algorithm; High detection rate; Information entropy; Network intrusion detection systems; Wasserstein-GAN; Denial-of-service attack","Arjovsky, M., Bottou, L., (2017) Towards principled methods for training generative adversarial networks; Arjovsky, M., Chintala, S., Bottou, L., (2017) Wasserstein GAN; Bi, J., Zhang, K., Cheng, X., Intrusion detection based on RBF neural network (2009) International Symposium on Information Engineering and Electronic Commerce, IEEC’09.

Failure to prevent the intrusions could degrade the credibility of security services, e.g. data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Numerous intrusion detection methods have been proposed in the literature to tackle computer security threats, which can be broadly classified into Signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (SIDS) and Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Systems (AIDS). This survey paper presents a taxonomy of contemporary IDS, a comprehensive review of notable recent works, and an overview of the datasets commonly used for evaluation purposes. It also presents evasion techniques used by attackers to avoid detection and discusses future research challenges to counter such techniques so as to make computer systems more secure. © 2019, The Author(s).","Anomaly detection;

Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, United States","In this paper, we investigate the importance of a defense system's learning rates to fight against the self-propagating class of malware such as worms and bots. To this end, we introduce a new propagation model based on the interactions between an adversary (and its agents) who wishes to construct a zombie army of a specific size, and a defender taking advantage of standard security tools and technologies such as honeypots (HPs) and intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSes) in the network environment. As time goes on, the defender can incrementally learn from the collected/observed attack samples (e.g., malware payloads), and therefore being able to generate attack signatures. The generated signatures then are used for filtering next attack trafic and thus containing the attacker's progress in its malware propagation mission. Using simulation and numerical analysis, we evaluate the eficacy of signature generation algorithms and in general any learning-based scheme in bringing an adversary's maneuvering in the environment to a halt as an adversarial containment strategy. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Botnet; Cloud security; Honeypot; Intrusion detection and prevention system; Learning-based model; Malware; Propagation modeling; Security games; Self-replicating code; Worm","Botnet; Cloud computing; Computer worms; Cryptography; Intrusion detection; Malware; Network security; Cloud securities; Honeypots; Intrusion detection and prevention systems; Learning Based Models; Propagation modeling; Security games; Self-replicating codes; Worm; Learning systems","Bhuyan, M.H., Bhattacharyya, D.K., Kalita, J.K., Network anomaly detection: Methods, systems and tools (2014) Ieee Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 16 (1), pp. 303-336. , 2014; Chen, Y., Li, Y., Cheng, X.-Q., Guo, L., Survey and taxonomy of feature selection algorithms in intrusion detection system (2006) Information Security and Cryptology, pp. 153-167. , Springer; Chen, Z., Gao, L., Kwiat, K., Modeling the spread of active worms (2003) INFOCOM 2003.

As Information and Communication Technology is connected to the grid, it is subjected to both physical and cyber-attacks because of the interaction between industrial control systems and the outside Internet environment using IoT technology. Often, cyber-attacks lead to multiple risks that affect infrastructure and business continuity; furthermore, in some cases, human beings are also affected. Because of the traditional peculiarities of process systems, such as insecure real-time protocols, end-to-end general-purpose ICT security mechanisms are not able to fully secure communication in SCADA systems. In this paper, we present a novel method based on the DNP3 vulnerability assessment and attack model in different layers, with feature selection using Machine Learning from parsed DNP3 protocol with additional data including malware samples. Moreover, we developed a cyber-attack algorithm that included a classification and visualization process.

In particular, promising detection results have been demonstrated in conjunction with Software-Defined Networks (SDN), in which the logically centralized control plane provides access to data from across the network. However, research into adversarial attacks against machine learning classifiers has highlighted vulnerabilities in a number of fields. These vulnerabilities raise concerns about the implementation of similar classifiers in anomaly-based NIDSs within SDNs. In this work, we investigate the viability of adversarial attacks against classifiers in this field. We implement an anomaly-based NIDS, Neptune, as a target platform that utilises a number of different machine learning classifiers and traffic flow features. We develop an adversarial test tool, Hydra, to evaluate the impact of adversarial evasion classifier attacks against Neptune with the goal of lowering the detection rate of malicious network traffic. The results demonstrate that with the perturbation of a few features, the detection accuracy of a specific SYN flood Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack by Neptune decreases from 100% to 0% across a number of classifiers. Based on these results, recommendations are made as to how to increase the robustness of classifiers against the demonstrated attacks. © 2019 IEEE.","Adversarial Attacks; Intrusion Detection Systems; Machine Learning; Network Security; Software-Defined Networks","Access control; Denial-of-service attack; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Machine learning; Network security; Software defined networking; Transfer functions; Adversarial Attacks; Anomaly-based NIDS; Centralized control; Detection accuracy; Detection rates; Distributed denial of service attack; Intrusion Detection Systems; Network intrusion detection systems; Network function virtualization","Ahmad, I., Namal, S., Ylianttila, M., Gurtov, A., Security in software defined networks: A survey (2015) IEEE Communications Surveys Tutorials, 17 (4), pp. 2317-2346. , Fourthquarter; Corona, I., Giacinto, G., Roli, F., Adversarial attacks against intrusion detection systems: Taxonomy, solutions and open issues (2013) Information Sciences, 239, pp. 201-225; Kwon, H., Kim, Y., Park, K., Yoon, H., Choi, C., Multi-targeted adversarial example in evasion attack on deep neural network (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 46084-46096; Goodfellow, I., McDaniel, P., Papernot, N., Making machine learning robust against adversarial inputs (2018) Commun.

With the rapid development of machine learning technologies, artificial neural network (ANN) has been used to classify DoS attacks. However, ANN models are vulnerable to adversarial samples: Inputs that are specially crafted to yield incorrect outputs. In this work, we explore a kind of DoS adversarial attacks which aim to bypass ANN-based DoS intrusion detection systems. By analyzing features of DoS samples, we propose an improved boundary-based method to craft adversarial DoS samples. The key idea is to optimize a Mahalanobis distance by perturbing continuous features and discrete features of DoS samples respectively. We experimentally study the effectiveness of our method in two trained ANN classifiers on KDDcup99 dataset and CICIDS2017 dataset. Results show that our method can craft adversarial DoS samples with limited queries. © 2019 IEEE.","Adversarial samples; ANN; Boundary based attack; DoS detection; Mahalanobis distance; Optimization","Classification (of information); Intrusion detection; Network security; Neural networks; Optimization; Ann classifiers; Boundary based attack; Boundary-based methods; Continuous features; Denial of Service; Intrusion Detection Systems; Machine learning technology; Mahalanobis distances; Denial-of-service attack","Ahmad, I., Abdullah, A.B., Alghamdi, A.S., Application of artificial neural network in detection of dos attacks (2009) Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Security of Information and Networks.

Recently, an amalgamation of work has realized such defenses using Deep Learning (DL) based algorithms. Although DL-based algorithms are generally prone to adversarial learning attacks, the extent to which those attacks are applicable to DDoS defenses in SDN is unexamined. In this work, we explore the robustness of DL-based DDoS defenses in SDN against adversarial learning attacks. First, we investigate generic off-the-shelf adversarial attacks to test the robustness of DDoS defenses in SDN, and demonstrate that while they lead to misclassification, these attacks do not preserve the characteristics of flows. As a result, we propose Flow-Merge for realistic adversarial flows while achieving a high evasion rate, with both targeted and untargeted misclassification attacks. The proposed Flow-Merge is able to force the DL-based DDoS defenses to misclassify 100% of benign flows as malicious, while preserving original characteristics of flows. Using state-of-the-art defenses, we show that the adversarial flows generated using Flow-Merge are difficult to detect, with only 49.31% detection rate when using adversarial training. © 2019 IEEE.","Adversarial Machine Learning; Deep Learning; Intrusion Detection Systems; Software Defined Networking","Deep learning; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Mergers and acquisitions; Metals; Network security; Software defined networking; Adversarial learning; DDoS detection; Detection rates; Distributed denial of service defense; Intrusion Detection Systems; Misclassifications; Software defined networking (SDN); State of the art; Denial-of-service attack","Schehlmann, L., Abt, S., Baier, H., Blessing or curse?

APTs are stealthy attacks with the primary objective of gaining unauthorized access to network assets. They often remain dormant for an extended period of time, which makes their detection challenging. In this paper, we leverage machine learning (ML) to detect hosts in a network that are targeted by an APT attack. We evaluate a number of ML classifiers to detect susceptible hosts in the Los Alamos National Lab dataset. We explore (i) graph-based features extracted from multiple data sources i.e., network flows and host authentication logs, (ii) feature engineering to reduce dimensionality, and (iii) balancing the training dataset using numerous over- and under-sampling techniques. Finally, we compare our model to the state-of-the-art approaches that leverage the same dataset, and show that our model outperforms them with respect to prediction performance and overhead. © 2019 IFIP.","advanced persistent threat; intrusion detection; Machine learning","Authentication; Balancing; Classification (of information); Flow graphs; Graphic methods; Learning systems; Machine learning; advanced persistent threat; Feature engineerings; Graph-based features; Host authentication; Multiple data sources; Prediction performance; State-of-the-art approach; Unauthorized access; Intrusion detection","Gatlan, S., (2019) Asus Live Update Infected with Backdoor in Supply Chain Attack, , https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/asus-liveupdate-infected-with-backdoor-in-supply-chain-attack/, Mar, accessed: 2019-04-05.

In this paper, we adapt and describe a GAN method for creating network traffic data at the IP packet layer. Generating realistic network traffic is essential for development and testing of techniques in Cyber and network security related tasks such as anomaly or intrusion detection. The effectiveness of such network monitoring techniques depends directly on the traffic data. Despite this, traffic generation is often considered low priority because it is difficult. Using GANs, we prototype and prove feasibility in the generation of real traffic flows such as ICMP Pings, DNS queries, and HTTP web requests. Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) GANs, we propose an alternative encoding of network traffic data into the CNN model. Experiments show our generated traffic can be successfully transmitted through the Internet eliciting desired responses from the network. The work described in this paper is the first step in demonstrating successful creation and transmission of network traffic; it forms the basis for future GAN based traffic generators at scale. © 2019 IEEE.","Convolutional Neural Networks; Cyber Security; Deep-Learning; Generative Adversarial Networks; Network Security; Packet Encoding; Test Generation; Traffic Generation","Convolution; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Encoding (symbols); HTTP; Internet protocols; Intrusion detection; Mobile telecommunication systems; Neural networks; Packet networks; Signal encoding; Adversarial networks; Convolutional neural network; Cyber security; Test generations; Traffic generation; Network security","Rigaki, M., Garcia, S., Bringing a GAN to a knife-fight: Adapting malware communication to avoid detection (2018) IEEE Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW), pp. 70-75. , San Francisco, CA; Lin, Z., Shi, Y., Xue, Z., (2018) IDSGAN: Generative Adversarial Networks for Attack Generation Against Intrusion Detection, , unpublished; Nour, M., Slay, J., UNSW-NB15: A comprehensive data set for network intrusion detection systems (UNSW-NB15 Data Set) (2015) Military Communications & Information Systems Conference; (2019) IXIA BreakingPoint, , https://www.ixiacom.com/products/test, Oct; Goodfellow, I., Pouget-Abadie, J., Mirza, M., Xu, B., Warde-Farley, D., Ozair, S., Courville, A., Bengio, V., Generative adversarial nets (2014) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems; Antipov, G., Baccouche, M., Dugelay, J., Face aging with conditional generative adversarial networks (2017) IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), pp. 2089-2093. , Beijing; Zhu, J., Park, T., Isola, P., Efros, Al., Unpaired image-to-image translation using cycle-consistent adversarial networks (2017) IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV); Kim, H., Garrido, P., Tewari, A., Xu, W., Thies, J., Niessner, M., Perez, P., Theobalt, C., Deep video portraits (2018) ACM Transactions on Graphics, pp. 1631-16314; Olof, M., Continuous recurrent neural networks with adversarial training (2016) Constructive Machine-Learning Workshop; Ring, M., Schlör, D., Landes, D., Hotho, A., (2018) Flow-based Network Traffic Generation Using Generative Adversarial Networks, , unpublished; Yin, C., Zhu, Y., Liu, S., Fei, J., Zhang, H., An enhancing framework for botnet detection using generative adversarial networks (2018) IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence & Big Data; Hu, W., Tan, Y., (2017) Generating Adversarial Malware Examples for Black-box Attacks Based on GAN, , unpublished; Millar, K., Cheng, A., Chew, H.G., Lim, C.C., Using convolutional neural networks for classifying malicious network traffic (2019) Press, Deep Learning Application for Cyber Security, , Book, Springer; (2019), https://www.tensorflow.org, Oct","Cheng, A.; Defence Science and Technology, Australia; email: Adriel.Cheng@dst.defence.gov.au","Chakrabarti S.Saha H.N.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728125305,,,"English","IEEE Annu.

Thanks to the increasing availability of high-quality data and the success of deep learning algorithms, machine learning (ML)-based detection and classification have been increasingly effective and adopted against sophisticated attacks. However, many of these techniques rely on the assumptions that the training and testing datasets share the same distribution and the same class labels in a stationary environment. As such assumptions may fail to hold when the system dynamics shift and new threat variants emerge in a non-stationary environment, the capability of trained ML models to adapt in complex operating scenarios will be critical to their deployment in real-world smart grid communications. To this aim, this paper proposes a domain-adversarial transfer learning framework for robust intrusion detection against smart grid attacks. The framework introduces domain-adversarial training to create a mapping between the labeled source domain and the unlabeled target domain so that the classifiers can learn in a new feature space against unknown threats. The proposed framework with different baseline classifiers was evaluated using a smart grid cyber-attack dataset collected over a realistic hardware-in-the- loop security testbed. The results have demonstrated effective performance improvements of trained classifiers against unseen threats of different types and locations. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Classification (of information); Computer crime; Deep learning; Electric power transmission networks; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Smart power grids; Cyber infrastructures; Effective performance; Hard-ware-in-the-loop; Non-stationary environment; Smart Grid Communications; Stationary environments; Training and testing; Transfer learning; Intrusion detection","Mashima, D., Chen, B., Zhou, T., Rajendran, R., Sikdar, B., Securing substations through command authentication using on-the-fly simulation of power system dynamics (2018) 2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids (SmartGridComm), pp. 1-7. , Oct; Chromik, J., Pilch, C., Brackmann, P., Duhme, C., Everinghoff, F., Giberlein, A., Teodorowicz, T., Remke, A., Context-aware local intrusion detection in scada systems: A testbed and two showcases (2017) 2017 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm), pp. 467-472. , Oct; He, H., Yan, J., Cyber-physical attacks and defences in the smart grid: A survey (2016) IET Cyber-Physical Systems: Theory Applications, 1 (1), pp. 13-27; (2015) Business Blackout: The Insurance Implications of A Cyber Attack on the Us Power Grid, , Lloyds and the University of Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies, Tech.

Many previous intrusion detection studies which focused on the classification between normal or anomaly events can be used to enhance the system security by launching alarms as the intrusions being detected. Although many intrusion detection systems which has been developed can achieve high detection rates, they are still difficult to perform well on some attacks that have never been seen before. In this paper, the performance of multiple-category classification on NSL-KDD dataset is evaluated using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network - gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) to enhance training effectiveness.

Based on the unsupervised learning models autoencoder (AE) and the generative adversarial networks (GAN) model during deep learning, the study aim is to solve the imbalance of data and intrusion detection of high performance. The AE-CGAN (autoencoder-conditional GAN) model is proposed to improve the performance of intrusion detection. This model oversamples rare classes based on the GAN model in order to solve the performance degradation caused by data imbalance after processing the characteristics of the data to a lower level using the autoencoder model. To measure the performance of the AE-CGAN model, data is classified using random forest (RF), a typical machine learning classification algorithm. In this experiment, we used the canadian institute for cybersecurity intrusion detection system (CICIDS)2017 dataset, the latest public dataset of network intrusion detection system (NIDS), and compared the three models to confirm efficacy of the proposed model. We compared the performance of three types of models. These included single-RF, a classification model using only a classification algorithm, AE-RF which is processed by classifying data features, and the AE-CGAN model which is classified after solving the data feature processing and data imbalance. Experimental results showed that the performance of the AE-CGAN model proposed in this paper was the highest. In particular, when the data were unbalanced, the performances of recall and F1 score, which are more accurate performance indicators, were 93.29% and 95.38%, respectively.

In reality, IDSs can be defined as a one-class classification system, where the normal traffic is the target class. The high diversity of network attacks in addition to the need for generalization, motivate us to propose a semi-supervised method. Inspired by the successes of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for training deep models in semi-unsupervised setting, we have proposed an end-to-end deep architecture for IDS. The proposed architecture is composed of two deep networks, each of which trained by competing with each other to understand the underlying concept of the normal traffic class. The key idea of this paper is to compensate the lack of anomalous traffic by approximately obtain them from normal flows. In this case, our method is not biased towards the available intrusions in the training set leading to more accurate detection. The proposed method has been evaluated on NSL-KDD dataset. The results confirm that our method outperforms the other state-of-the-art approaches. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Computer crime; Network architecture; Network security; Supervised learning; Adversarial learning; Adversarial networks; Anomaly based intrusion detection systems; Deep architectures; One-class Classification; Proposed architectures; Semi-supervised method; State-of-the-art approach; Intrusion detection","Arjovsky, M., Chintala, S., Bottou, L., Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (2017) Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning, Ser.

While this phenomenon has been extensively studied within the image processing domain, comprehensive analyses are scarce in the cybersecurity field. This is a critical problem because cyber-detectors are being increasingly integrated with machine learning methods, making them suitable targets for skilled attackers leveraging adversarial samples to evade detection. In this paper, we propose a thorough analysis of realistic adversarial attacks performed against network intrusion detection systems that focus on identifying botnet traffic through machine learning classifiers. Our large campaign of experiments involves the most recent public datasets, representing multiple realistic network scenarios. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of these attacks against state-of-the-art detectors relying on different machine learning algorithms, providing a clear overview of this problem. The results outline the fragility of these methods.

It has been applied to address a diverse set of problems in multiple application domains including cybersecurity. Deep learning has recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on key anomaly detection applications, such as intrusion detection, Denial of Service (DoS) attack detection, security log analysis, and malware detection. Despite the great successes achieved by neural network architectures, models with very low test error have been shown to be consistently vulnerable to small, adversarially chosen perturbations of the input. The existence of evasion attacks during the test phase of machine learning algorithms represents a significant challenge to both their deployment and understanding. Recent approaches in the literature have focused on three different areas: (a) generating adversarial examples in supervised machine learning in multiple domains; (b) countering the attacks with various defenses; (c) theoretical guarantees on the robustness of machine learning models by understanding their security properties. However, they have not covered, from the perspective of the anomaly detection task in a black box setting. The exploration of black box attack strategies, which reduce the number of queries for finding adversarial examples with high probability, is an important problem. In this paper, we study the security of black box deep anomaly detectors with a realistic threat model. We propose a novel black box attack in query constraint settings. First, we run manifold approximation on samples collected at attacker end for query reduction and understanding various thresholds set by underlying anomaly detector, and use spherical adversarial subspaces to generate attack samples. This method is well suited for attacking anomaly detectors where decision boundaries of nominal and abnormal classes are not very well defined and decision process is done with a set of thresholds on anomaly scores. We validate our attack on state-of-the-art deep anomaly detectors and show that the attacker goal is achieved under constraint settings. Our evaluation of the proposed approach shows promising results and demonstrates that our strategy can be successfully used against other anomaly detectors. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

In this work, we present a new intrusion detection algorithm with an excellent prediction performance. The prediction is based on a classifier which is a simple and extremely fast neural network. The classifier implements a policy function that is trained with a novel reinforcement learning model, where the behavior of the environment is adjusted in parallel with the learning process. Intrusion detection frameworks are based on a supervised learning paradigm that uses a training dataset composed of network features and associated intrusion labels. In this work, we integrate this paradigm with a reinforcement learning algorithm that is normally based on interaction with a live environment (not a pre-recorded dataset). To perform the integration, the live environment is replaced by a simulated one. The principle of this approach is to provide the simulated environment with an intelligent behavior by, first, generating new samples by randomly extracting them from the training dataset, generating rewards that depend on the goodness of the classifier's predictions, and, second, by further adjusting this initial behavior with an adversarial objective in which the environment will actively try to increase the difficulty of the prediction made by the classifier. In this way, the simulated environment acts as a second agent in an adversarial configuration against the original agent (the classifier). We prove that this architecture increases the final performance of the classifier. This work presents the first application of adversarial reinforcement learning for intrusion detection, and provides a novel technique that incorporates the environment's behavior into the learning process of a modified reinforcement learning algorithm. We prove that the proposed algorithm is adequate for a supervised learning problem based on a labeled dataset. We validate its performance by comparing it with other well-known machine learning models for two datasets. The proposed model outperforms the other models in the weighted Accuracy (>0.8) and F1 (>0.79) metrics, and especially excels in the results for the under-represented labels. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Adversarial learning; Intrusion detection; Reinforcement learning","Classification (of information); Forecasting; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Reinforcement learning; Supervised learning; Adversarial environments; Adversarial learning; Intrusion detection algorithms; Machine learning models; Prediction performance; Reinforcement learning models; Simulated environment; Supervised learning problems; Learning algorithms","Bhuyan, M.H., Bhattacharyya, D.K., Kalita, J.K., Network anomaly detection: methods, systems and tools (2014) IEEE Commun.

The main objective of this paper is to study various issues in enabling technologies such as Cyber Physical System (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data Analytics (BDA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). IoT is a network of devices which link, interact and transfer data but security and privacy should concern while moving from traditional to modern world. CPS is a combination of data processing, networking and physical activities, through critical infrastructure attacker access computer devices and damages the system.

Android's popular and attractive environment not only captured the attention of users but also increased security concerns. As a result, Android malware detection is one of the sizzling topics in the mobile security domain. This paper provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art mobile malware attacks, vulnerabilities, detection techniques and security solutions over the period of 2013–2019 that majorly targeted Android platform. We have presented various well-organized and in-depth taxonomies that uncover mobile malware detection approaches based on their analysis techniques, working platform, data acquisition, operational impact, obtained results and artificial intelligence component involved. Another taxonomy comprises of mobile malware attack vector is presented to look threat clusters and loopholes to locate their malicious widespread impact on communities. Furthermore, we have discussed and classified forensic analysis efforts in mobile malware detection perspective. From the intruder point of view, we have compared various evasion techniques that are used prominently by the malware authors to hinder detection efforts. Finally, future work directions are presented as guidelines for academia and industry alike to help them reduce or even avoid the harmful impact of these annoying efforts. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Android malware; Forensics; Machine learning; Malware; Mobile malware; Mobile malware detection","Android (operating system); Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Computer forensics; Data acquisition; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Mobile security; Taxonomies; Analysis techniques; Android malware; Android platforms; Detection efforts; Forensics; Mobile malware; Operational impacts; Security solutions; Malware","Portal, S.T.S., Number of mobile phone users worldwide from 2013 to 2019 (in billions) (2018), https://www.statista.com/statistics/274774/forecast-of-mobile-phone-users-worldwide/, Available from:; Popper, B., Google announces over 2 billion monthly active devices on android (2017), https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15654454/android-reaches-2-billion-monthly-active-users, May 17, 2017; Available from; Lueg, C., Some 343 new android malware samples every hour in 2017 (2018), https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2018/02/30491-some-343-new-android-malware-samples-every-hour-in-2017, 2/20/2018; Available from:; Ahn, A., How we fought bad apps and malicious developers in 2017 (2018), https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/01/how-we-fought-bad-apps-and-malicious.html, 1/30/2018 3/20/2018; Available from:; Saracino, A., Madam: Effective and efficient behavior-based android malware detection and prevention (2016) IEEE Trans.

However, due to the absence of the inbuilt security functions the learning phase itself is not secured which allows attacker to exploit the security vulnerabilities in the machine learning model. When a malicious adversary manipulates the input data, it exploits vulnerabilities of machine learning algorithms which can compromise the entire system. In this research study, we are conducting a vulnerability assessment of the malware classification model by injecting the datasets with an adversarial example to degrade the quality of classification obtained currently by a trained model. The objective is to find the security gaps that are exploitable in the model. The vulnerability assessment is done by introducing the malware classification model to an AML environment using the Black-Box attack. The simulation provided an insight into the inputs injected into the classifiers and proves the inherent security vulnerability exists in the classification model. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Adversarial Machine Learning; Black-Box Attack; Intrusion Detection System; Machine Learning; Malware Classification; Poisoning Attack","Classification (of information); Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Malware; Black boxes; Intrusion Detection Systems; Machine learning models; Malicious adversaries; Malware classifications; Poisoning attacks; Security vulnerabilities; Vulnerability assessments; Machine learning","Liaw, A., Wiener, M., Classification and regression by randomForest (2002) R News, 2 (3), pp. 18-22; Al-Dujaili, A., Huang, A., Hemberg, E., O'Reilly, U.-M., Adversarial deep learning for robust detection of binary encoded malware (2018) 2018 IEEE Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW), pp. 76-82; Duddu, V., A survey of adversarial machine learning in cyber warfare (2018) Defence Science Journal, 68 (4), pp. 356-366; Grosse, K., Papernot, N., Manoharan, P., Backes, M., McDaniel, P., Adversarial examples for malware detection (2017) European Symposium on Research in Computer Security, pp. 62-79. , Springer, Cham; Goodfellow, I.J., Shlens, J., Szegedy, C., (2014) Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples, , arXiv preprint; Huang, L., Joseph, A.D., Nelson, B., Rubinstein, B.I.P., Tygar, J.D., Adversarial machine learning (2011) Proceedings of the 4th ACM Workshop on Security and Artificial Intelligence, pp. 43-58; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Joseph, A.D., Doug Tygar, J., The security of machine learning (2010) Machine Learning, 81 (2), pp. 121-148; Adankon, M.M., Cheriet, M., Support vector machine (2015) Encyclopedia of Biometrics, pp. 1504-1511; Papernot, N., Goodfellow, I., Sheatsley, R., Feinman, R., McDaniel, P., (2016) Cleverhans V1. 0.0: An Adversarial Machine Learning Library, , arXiv preprint; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Goodfellow, I., Jha, S., Berkay Celik, Z., Swami, A., Practical black-box attacks against machine learning (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 506-519; Suthaharan, S., Machine learning models and algorithms for big data classification (2016) Integr.

Furthermore, the performance of deep learning based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is satisfactory and even better than the traditional methods. However, recent researches show that the accuracy of deep learning based image classification declines sharply when facing the adversaries. Regarding NIDS, there is no comprehensive evaluation of whether it will also be affected by attack models. In this paper, we propose a framework of Evaluationg Network Intrusion Detection System (ENIDS) to research the robustness of deep learning based NIDS in adversarial environment. More specifically, we train four target models (e.g., Deep Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Logistic Regression) over the benchmark dataset NSL-KDD. Furthermore, four advanced attack models (e.g., Projected Gradient Descent attack, Momentum Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method, L-BFGS attack and SPSA attack) are used to generate adversarial samples. Finally, comprehensive and extensive experiment results show that the effectiveness of deep learning based NIDS is greatly undermined by the adversaries. © 2019 IEEE.","deep learning; network and data security; network intrusion system; security evaluation","Computer crime; Decision trees; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Gradient methods; Intrusion detection; Support vector machines; Adversarial environments; Benchmark datasets; Comprehensive evaluation; Logistic regressions; Network intrusion detection systems; Network intrusion systems; Projected gradient; Security evaluation; Network security","Liao, H.J., Lin, C.H.R., Lin, Y.C., Tung, K.Y., Intrusion detection system: A comprehensive review (2013) Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 36 (1), pp. 16-24; Kwon, D., Kim, H., Kim, J., Suh, S.C., Kim, I., Kim, K.J., A survey of deep learning-based network anomaly detection (2017) Cluster Computing, pp. 1-13; McDaniel, P., Papernot, N., CeliK, Z.B., Machine learning in adversarial settings (2016) IEEE Security \& Privacy, 14 (3), pp. 68-72; Sabahi, F., Movaghar, A., Intrusion detection: A survey (2008) Poceedings of 2008 Third International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications, pp. 23-26; Nkiama, H., Said, S.Z.M., Saidu, M., A subset feature elimination mechanism for intrusion detection system (2016) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 7 (4), pp. 148-157; Mirsky, Y., Doitshman, T., Eloviciet, Y., Shabtai, A., Kitsune: An ensemble of autoencoders for online network intrusion detection (2018) Proc.

Examples include malware analysis, especially for zero-day malware detection, threat analysis, anomaly based intrusion detection of prevalent attacks on critical infrastructures, and many others. Due to the ineffectiveness of signature-based methods in detecting zero day attacks or even slight variants of known attacks, machine learning-based detection is being used by researchers in many cybersecurity products. In this review, we discuss several areas of cybersecurity where machine learning is used as a tool. We also provide a few glimpses of adversarial attacks on machine learning algorithms to manipulate training and test data of classifiers, to render such tools ineffective.

Managing this flexibility is often driven by machine learning, and requires real-time control and aggregation of these devices, involving a diverse set of companies and devices and creating a longer chain of trust. This poses a security risk, as it is sensitive to adversarial machine learning, whereby models are fooled through malicious input, either for financial gain or to cause system disruption. We show the feasibility of such an attack by analysing empirical data of a real system, and propose directions for future research related to detection and defence mechanisms for these kind of attacks. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Adversarial machine learning; Intrusion detection; Smart energy systems","Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Real time control; Decentralisation; Defence mechanisms; Empirical data; Energy generations; Energy systems; Financial gains; Security risks; Smart energy systems; Smart power grids","Chen, B., Pattanaik, N., Goulart, A., Butler-Purry, K.L., Kundur, D., Implementing attacks for modbus/TCP protocol in a real-time cyber physical system test bed (2015) 2015 IEEE International Workshop Technical Committee on Communications Quality and Reliability (CQR), pp. 1-6. , IEEE, Charleston, SC, USA; Chen, Y., Tan, Y., Deka, D., Is machine learning in power systems vulnerable?

However, such systems are vulnerable to attackers who can cause deliberate misclassification by introducing small perturbations. With machine learning systems being proposed for cyber attack detection such attackers are cause for serious concern. Despite this the vast majority of adversarial machine learning security research is focused on the image domain. This work gives a brief overview of adversarial machine learning and machine learning used in cyber attack detection and suggests key differences between the traditional image domain of adversarial machine learning and the cyber domain. Finally we show an adversarial machine learning attack on an industrial control system. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Adversarial machine learning; Intrusion detection; Neural networks","Anomaly detection; Computer aided design; Computer crime; Crime; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Network security; Neural networks; Cyber-attacks; Image domain; Industrial control systems; Misclassifications; NAtural language processing; Security research; Small perturbations; Machine learning","Alzantot, M., Sharma, Y., Chakraborty, S., Srivastava, M., (2018) GenAttack: Practical Black-box Attacks with Gradient-Free Optimization, , arXiv preprint, 2018; Athalye, A., Carlini, N., Wagner, D., (2018) Obfuscated Gradients Give A False Sense of Security: Circumventing Defenses to Adversarial Examples, , ArXiv e-prints , Feb. 2018; Carlini, N., Athalye, A., Papernot, N., Brendel, W., Rauber, J., Tsipras, D., Goodfellow, I., Kurakin, A., (2019) On Evaluating Adversarial Robustness, , arXiv e-prints, Article arXiv: 1902.06705, Feb. 2019, arXiv:1902.06705 pages. arXiv:cs.LG/1902.06705; Carlini, N., Wagner, D., Towards evaluating the robustness of neural networks (2017) 2017 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP), pp. 39-57. , IEEE; Feng, C., Li, T., Chana, D., Multi-level anomaly detection in industrial control systems via package signatures and LSTM networks (2017) 2017 47th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN)., pp. 261-272. , https://doi.org/10.1109/DSN.2017.34; Feng, C., Li, T., Zhu, Z., Chana, D., (2017) A Deep Learning-based Framework for Conducting Stealthy Attacks in Industrial Control Systems, , ArXiv e-prints, Sept. 2017, arXiv:cs.CR/1709.06397; Gal, Y., Ghahramani, Z., Dropout as a Bayesian approximation: Representing model uncertainty in deep learning (2016) International Conference on Machine Learning., pp. 1050-1059; Goh, J., Adepu, S., Nazir Junejo, K., Mathur, A., A dataset to support research in the design of securewater treatment systems (2017) Critical Information Infrastructures Security, pp. 88-99. , Grigore Havarneanu, Roberto Setola, Hypatia Nassopoulos, and Stephen Wolthusen (Eds.)., Springer International Publishing, Cham; Goh, J., Adepu, S., Tan, M., Shan Lee, Z., Anomaly detection in cyber physical systems using recurrent neural networks (2017) High Assurance Systems Engineering (HASE), 2017 IEEE 18th International Symposium on, pp. 140-145. , IEEE; Goodfellow, I.J., Shlens, J., Szegedy, C., (2014) Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples, , arXiv preprint arXiv 1412.6572, 2014; Grosse, K., Manoharan, P., Papernot, N., Backes, M., McDaniel, P., (2017) On the (Statistical) Detection of Adversarial Examples, , arXiv preprint arXiv 1702.06280, 2017; Grosse, K., Papernot, N., Manoharan, P., Backes, M., McDaniel, P., (2016) Adversarial Perturbations Against Deep Neural Networks for Malware Classification, , arXiv preprint arXiv 1606.04435, 2016; Hu, W., Tan, Y., (2017) Generating Adversarial Malware Examples for Black-Box Attacks Based on GAN, , arXiv preprint arXiv, 1702.05983, 2017; Madry, A., Makelov, A., Schmidt, L., Tsipras, D., Vladu, A., (2017) Towards Deep Learning Models Resistant to Adversarial Attacks, , arXiv preprint arXiv, 1706.06083, 2017; Morris, T.H., Thornton, Z., Turnipseed, I., Industrial control system simulation and data logging for intrusion detection system research (2015) 7th Annual Southeastern Cyber Security Summit, 2015; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Jha, S., Fredrikson, M., Berkay Celik, Z., Swami, A., The limitations of deep learning in adversarial settings (2016) Security and Privacy (EuroS&P), 2016 IEEE European Symposium on, pp. 372-387. , IEEE; Xu, W., Evans, D., Qi, Y., (2017) Feature Squeezing: Detecting Adversarial Examples in Deep Neural Networks, , arXiv preprint arXiv, 1704.01155, 2017",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",0738100X,9781450367257,PDAWD,,"English","Proc Des Autom Conf",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067793109

Many machine learning (ML)-based IDSs have been proposed in the literature for the detection of malicious network traffic. However, recent works have shown that ML models are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations through which an adversary can cause IDSs to malfunction by introducing a small impracticable perturbation in the network traffic. In this paper, we propose an adversarial ML attack using generative adversarial networks (GANs) that can successfully evade an ML-based IDS. We also show that GANs can be used to inoculate the IDS and make it more robust to adversarial perturbations. © 2019 IEEE.","Adversarial machine learning; GAN; IDS","Computer crime; Computer networks; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Mobile computing; Adversarial networks; Intrusion Detection Systems; Network intrusion detection systems; Network traffic; Network security","Anderson, H.S., Kharkar, A., Filar, B., Evans, D., Roth, P., (2018) Learning to Evade Static PE Machine Learning Malware Models Via Reinforcement Learning; Arjovsky, M., Chintala, S., Bottou, L., Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (2017) International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 214-223; Buczak, A.L., Guven, E., A survey of data mining and machine learning methods for cyber security intrusion detection (2016) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 18 (2), pp. 1153-1176; Garcia-Teodoro, P., Diaz-Verdejo, J., Maciá-Fernández, G., Vázquez, E., Anomaly-based network intrusion detection: Techniques, systems and challenges (2009) Computers & Security, 28 (1-2), pp. 18-28; Goodfellow, I., Pouget-Abadie, J., Mirza, M., Xu, B., Warde-Farley, D., Ozair, S., Courville, A., Bengio, Y., Generative adversarial nets (2014) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2672-2680; Grosse, K., Papernot, N., Manoharan, P., Backes, M., McDaniel, P., (2016) Adversarial Perturbations Against Deep Neural Networks for Malware Classification; Hu, W., Tan, Y., (2017) Generating Adversarial Malware Examples for Blackbox Attacks Based on Gan; Ingre, B., Yadav, A., Performance analysis of NSL-KDD dataset using ANN (2015) Signal Processing and Communication Engineering Systems (SPACES), 2015 International Conference On.

An adversary in control of a single vehicle can degrade platoon efficiency or even cause collisions. In this paper, we focus on detecting an attack meant to destabilize a platoon, thereby causing collisions, and identifying the source of the attack(i.e., the vehicle under control of the adversary) using Fully Connected Deep Neural Networks (FCDNN) and ConvolutionalNeural Networks (CNN). The vehicles in the platoon are assumedto be equipped with sensors (LIDAR and RADAR) that measure the range and relative speed of their immediate neighbors. These sensor data, modelled with noise following a Gaussian distribution, are used to train a FCDNN and CNN for attack detection and identification. The effectiveness of these networks are tested for different scenarios based on local and global sensor information availability. The initial study show that fora ten vehicle platoon, CNN detects and identifies an attack with highest accuracy of 97.5%, just by using the own local sensor information. We also show that the range measurements providebetter accuracy in comparison to the velocity measurements. The platoon is modelled and simulated in MATLAB and neural networks are generated and tested using Tensorflow and Keras deep learning libraries. © 2019 IEEE.","Autonomous Platoon; Cyber Physical Systems; Deep Neural Network; Intrusion Detection","Cyber Physical System; Deep neural networks; Intrusion detection; MATLAB; Optical radar; Vehicles; Adversarial agent; Attack detection; Autonomous platoons; Passenger safety; Range measurements; Sensor informations; Vehicle platoons; Vehicular platoons; Embedded systems","Shladover, S.E., The California path program of ivhs research and its approach to vehicle-highway automation (1992) Intelligent Vehicles' 92 Symposium., Proceedings of the, pp. 347-352. , IEEE; Ioannou, P., (2013) Automated Highway Systems, , Springer Science & Business Media; Bergenhem, C., Shladover, S., Coelingh, E., Englund, C., Tsugawa, S., Overview of platooning systems (2012) Proceedings of the 19th ITS World Congress, , Oct 22-26, Vienna, Austria ( 2012; Sajjad, I., Dunn, D.D., Sharma, R., Gerdes, R., Attack mitigation in adversarial platooning using detection-based sliding mode control (2015) Proceedings of the First ACM Workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems-Security And/or PrivaCy, pp. 43-53. , ACM; Davila, A., Del Pozo, E., Aramburu, E., Freixas, A., (2013) Environmental Benefits of Vehicle Platooning, , tech. rep., SAE Technical Paper; Swaroop, D., Hedrick, J.K., String stability of interconnected systems (1996) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 41 (3), pp. 349-357; Barooah, P., Hespanha, J.P., Error amplification and disturbance propagation in vehicle strings with decentralized linear control (2005) Decision and Control 2005 and 2005 European Control Conference.

Among the many open issues that affect security systems based on machine learning, we concentrate on adversarial attacks that aim to affect the detection and prediction capabilities of machine-learning models. We consider realistic types of poisoning and evasion attacks targeting security solutions devoted to malware, spam and network intrusion detection. We explore the possible damages that an attacker can cause to a cyber detector and present some existing and original defensive techniques in the context of intrusion detection systems. This paper contains several performance evaluations that are based on extensive experiments using large traffic datasets. The results highlight that modern adversarial attacks are highly effective against machine-learning classifiers for cyber detection, and that existing solutions require improvements in several directions. The paper paves the way for more robust machine-learning-based techniques that can be integrated into cyber security platforms. © 2019 NATO CCD COE.","adversarial attacks; deep learning; evasion attacks; intrusion detection; machine learning; poisoning attacks","Damage detection; Deep learning; Intrusion detection; Large dataset; Learning systems; Machine learning; Security systems; adversarial attacks; evasion attacks; Intrusion Detection Systems; Machine learning models; Network intrusion detection; Poisoning attacks; Prediction capability; Security solutions; Malware","LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y., Hinton, G., Deep learning (2015) Nature; Jordan, M.I., Mitchell, T.M., Machine learning: Trends, perspectives, and prospects (2015) Science; Dua, S., Du, X., Data mining and machine learning in cybersecurity Auerbach Publications, 2016; Stevanovic, M., Pedersen, J.M., On the use of machine learning for identifying botnet network traffic Journal of Cyber Security and Mobility, 2016; Gardiner, J., Nagaraja, S., On the Security of Machine Learning in Malware C8C Detection ACM Computing Surveys, 2016; Huang, L., Joseph, A.D., Nelson, B., Rubinstein, B.I., Tygar, J., Adversarial machine learning (2011) Proc. 4th ACM Workshop Security and Artificial Intelligence; Biggio, B., Corona, I., Maiorca, D., Nelson, B., Srndic, N., Laskov, P., Giacinto, G., Roli, F., Evasion attacks against machine learning at test time (2013) Joint Eur.

Many organizations leverage machine learning tools to extract useful information from a massive amount of data. In particular, machine learning finds its application in cybersecurity that begins to enter the age of automation. However, machine learning applications in cybersecurity face unique challenges other domains rarely do—attacks from active adversaries. Problems in areas such as intrusion detection, banking fraud detection, spam filtering, and malware detection have to face challenges of adversarial attacks that modify data so that malicious instances would evade detection by the learning systems. The adversarial learning problem naturally resembles a game between the learning system and the adversary. In such a game, both players would attempt to play their best strategies against each other while maximizing their own payoffs. To solve the game, each player would search for an optimal strategy against the opponent based on the prediction of the opponent's strategy choice. The problem becomes even more complicated in settings where the learning system may have to deal with many adversaries of unknown types. Applying game-theoretic approach, robust learning techniques have been developed to specifically address adversarial attacks and the preliminary results are promising. In this review, we summarize these results.

On the other hand, intelligent data processing techniques for enhancing the performance of next-generation networks are mainly used to reinforce resource management, control and optimization. Therefore, compared to learning a classifier for other application scenarios (e.g., pattern recognition, network intrusion detection, image identification, etc.), learning a good regressor via machine learning is more valuable for edge computing applications in next-generation networks. Hence, we revisit the security of polynomial regression learning in this paper and propose a scalable poisoning method against regression-type edge computing applications via an approximate optimization strategy. Specifically, we first analyze the existing gradientbased optimization poisoning method (called OptP) against linear regression model. Then, we extend the method and give a formal description of poisoning against polynomial regression with order greater than one. After that, we propose a greedy optimization strategy to obtain good adversarial examples for compromising polynomial regression-type applications. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed poisoning method by applying it to attack against two synthetic data sets and three public data sets from three different application scenarios. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Edge computing; Information management; Intrusion detection; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Next generation networks; Pattern recognition; Polynomials; Approximate optimization; Computing applications; Control and optimization; Gradient-based optimization; Intelligent data processing; Linear regression models; Machine learning technology; Network intrusion detection; Polynomial regression","Kreutz, D., Ramos, F.M., Verissimo, P.E., Rothenberg, C.E., Azodolmolky, S., Uhlig, S., Software-defined networking: A comprehensive survey (2015) Proceedings of the IEEE, 103 (1), pp. 14-76; Buyya, R., Yeo, C.S., Venugopal, S., Broberg, J., Brandic, I., Cloud computing and emerging it platforms: Vision, hype, and reality for delivering computing as the 5th utility (2009) Future Generation Computer Systems, 25 (6), pp. 599-616; Huang, L., Feng, X., Qian, L., Wu, Y., Deep reinforcement learningbased task offloading and resource allocation for mobile edge computing (2018) Proc.

Yet, these models are vulnerable to a class of malicious inputs known as adversarial examples. These are slightly perturbed inputs that are classified incorrectly by the ML model. The mitigation of these adversarial inputs remains an open problem. As a step towards understanding adversarial examples, we show that they are not drawn from the same distribution than the original data, and can thus be detected using statistical tests. Using this knowledge, we introduce a complimentary approach to identify specific inputs that are adversarial. Specifically, we augment our ML model with an additional output, in which the model is trained to classify all adversarial inputs. © BEIESP.","Adversarial attacks; Generative Adversarial Network; Robust Classification",,"Carlini, N., Wagner, D., Towards evaluating the robustness of neural networks (2017) Security and Privacy (SP), 2017 IEEE Symposium On, pp. 39-57. , IEEE; Goodfellow, I.J., Shlens, J., Szegedy, C., (2014) Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples, , arXiv preprint arXiv; Nguyen, A., Yosinski, J., Clune, J., Deep neural networks are easily fooled: High confidence predictions for unrecognizable images (2015) 2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 427-436. , June, IEEE; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Goodfellow, I., (2016) Transferability in Machine Learning: From Phenomena to Black-Box Attacks Using Adversarial Samples; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Goodfellow, I., Jha, S., Berkaycelik, Z., Swami, A., (2016) Practical Black-Box Attacks against Deep Learning Systems Using Adversarial Examples; Kurakin, A., Goodfellow, I., Bengio, S., Adversarial examples in the physical world (2016) Arxiv Preprint Arxiv, 1607; Miyato, T., Maeda, S.I., Koyama, M., Nakae, K., Ishii, S., (2015) Distributional Smoothing with Virtual Adversarial Training.

However, an adversarial example created by adding a little noise to the original data can lead to misclassification by the DNN, and the human eye cannot detect the difference from the original data. For example, if an attacker generates a modified left-Turn road sign to be incorrectly categorized by a DNN, an autonomous vehicle with the DNN will incorrect classify the modified left-Turn road sign as a right-Turn sign, whereas a human will correctly classify the modified sign as a left-Turn sign. Such an adversarial example is a serious threat to a DNN. Recently, a multi-Target adversarial example was introduced that causes misclassification by several models within each target class using a single modified image. However, it has the vulnerability that as the number of target models increases, the overall attack success rate is reduced. Therefore, if there are several models that the attacker wishes to target, the attacker needs to control the attack success rate for each model by considering the attack priority for each model. In this paper, we propose a priority adversarial example that considers the attack priority for each model in cases targeting several models. The proposed method controls the attack success rate for each model by adjusting the weight of the attack function in the generation process, while maintaining minimum distortion. We used Tensorflow, a widely used machine learning library, and MNIST as the dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method can control the attack success rate for each model by considering the attack priority of each model while maintaining minimum distortion (on average 3.95 and 2.45 in targeted and untargeted attacks, respectively). © 2019 IEEE.","adversarial example; attack priority; deep neural network; multi-Targeted adversarial example","Autonomous vehicles; Image recognition; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Roads and streets; Speech recognition; adversarial example; attack priority; Generation process; Minimum distortions; Misclassifications; multi-Targeted adversarial example; Multi-targets; Target class; Deep neural networks","Abadi, M., Barham, P., Chen, J., Chen, Z., Davis, A., Dean, J., Devin, M., Isard, M., Tensorflow: A system for large-scale machine learning (2016) OSDI, 16, pp. 265-283; Carlini, N., Wagner, D., Towards evaluating the robustness of neural networks (2017) Security and Privacy (SP) 2017 IEEE Symposium on, pp. 39-57. , IEEE; Goodfellow, I., Shlens, J., Szegedy, C., Explaining and harnessing adversarial examples (2015) International Conference on Learning Representations; Kurakin, A., Goodfellow, I., Bengio, S., Adversarial examples in the physical world (2017) ICLR Workshop; Kwon, H., Kim, Y., Park, K., Yoon, H., Choi, D., Advanced ensemble adversarial example on unknown deep neural network classifiers (2018) IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems, 101 (10), pp. 2485-2500; Kwon, H., Kim, Y., Park, K., Yoon, H., Choi, D., Friend-safe evasion attack: An adversarial example that is correctly recognized by a friendly classifier (2018) Computers & Security, 78, pp. 380-397; Kwon, H., Kim, Y., Park, K., Yoon, H., Choi, D., Multi-Targeted adversarial example in evasion attack on deep neural network (2018) IEEE Access; Kwon, H., Kim, Y., Yoon, H., Choi, D., Random untargeted adversarial example on deep neural network (2018) Symmetry, 10 (12), p. 738; LeCun, Y., Bottou, Ĺ., Bengio, Y., Haffner, P., Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition (1998) Proceedings of the IEEE, 86 (11), pp. 2278-2324; LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., Burges, C.J.C., (2010) Mnist Handwritten Digit Database.

However, it is well-known that adversaries can adapt their attacks to evade detection. There has been some work on making machine learning models more robust to such attacks. However, one simple but promising approach called randomization is underexplored. In addition, most existing works focus on models with differentiable error functions while tree-based models do not have such error functions but are quite popular because they are easy to interpret. This paper proposes a novel randomization-based approach to improve robustness of tree-based models against evasion attacks. The proposed approach incorporates randomization into both model training time and model application time (meaning when the model is used to detect attacks). We also apply this approach to random forest, an existing ML method which already has incorporated randomness at training time but still often fails to generate robust models. We proposed a novel weighted-random-forest method to generate more robust models and a clustering method to add randomness at model application time. Experiments on intrusion detection and spam filtering data show that our approach further improves robustness of random-forest method. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Adversarial Learning; Evasion attacks; Intrusion Detection; Machine Learning; Spam Filtering","Decision trees; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Machine learning; Adversarial learning; Clustering methods; Evasion attacks; Machine learning models; Model application; Random forest methods; Security application; Spam filtering; Random processes","Akhtar, N., Mian, A., (2018) Threat of Adversarial Attacks on Deep Learning in Computer Vision: A Survey, (2018); Axelsson, S., (2000) Intrusion Detection Systems: A Survey and Taxonomy, , Technical Report.

As most threats propagate through the network, it is important to have proactive techniques to discover an infection before it damages a computer.This paper will examine how header-based information as well as other characteristics in the HTTP network traffic can be used to train a machine learning model to capture malicious behavior.Network streams tagged as malicious are preprocessed and clustered. It has been found that features in the raw byte stream augmented with handcrafted features are useful in learning the characteristics of network threats.In specific clusters formed, it is possible to identify certain threats targeting a specific server, or if there are characteristics that can be observed in the injected code for exploit detection.Clustering malicious network traffic leads to a better understanding of protection against these types of threats, identification of connected malware campaigns, and insight on future trends. © 2018 IEEE.","Big Data Applications; Computational Intelligence; Information Security; Intrusion Detection; Machine Learning; Network Security","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Cryptography; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Machine learning; Malware; Security of data; Big data applications; Byte streams; Future trends; Machine intelligence; Machine learning models; Network threats; Network traffic; Signature based detections; Network security","Portnoy, L., Eskin, E., Stolfo, S., Intrusion detection with unlabeled data using clustering (2001) Proceedings of ACM CSS Workshop on Data Mining Applied to Security (DMSA-2001, , Citeseer; Sanchez, G., (2016) Don't Always Judge A Packet by Its Cover, , https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/access/dont-judgepacket-cover-36745, January.

A prominent family of CPSs are networked control systems in which the control and feedback signals are carried over computer networks like the Internet. Communication over insecure networks make system vulnerable to cyber attacks. In this article, we design an intrusion detection and compensation framework based on system/plant identification to fight covert attacks. We collect error statistics of the output estimation during the learning phase of system operation and after that, monitor the system behavior to see if it significantly deviates from the expected outputs. A compensating controller is further designed to intervene and replace the classic controller once the attack is detected. The proposed model is tested on a DC motor as the plant and is put against a deception signal amplification attack over the forward link. Simulation results show that the detection algorithm well detects the intrusion and the compensator is also successful in alleviating the attack effects. © 2019 IEEE.","Control; Covert; Cyber physical system; Cyber security; Identification; Intrusion detection; Service degradation.","Computer control systems; Control engineering; Controllers; Cyber Physical System; DC motors; Embedded systems; Error statistics; Identification (control systems); Intrusion detection; Network security; Networked control systems; Covert; Cyber security; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Detection algorithm; Insecure networks; Intelligent adaptive control; Service degradation; Signal amplifications; Adaptive control systems","Wan, J., Yan, H., Li, D., Zhou, K., Zeng, L., Cyber-physical systems for optimal energy management scheme of autonomous electric vehicle (2013) The Computer Journal, 56, pp. 947-956; Toorchi, N., Ahmadian, M., Haghighi, M.S., Xiang, Y., A Markov model of safety message broadcasting for vehicular networks (2013) IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, pp. 1657-1662; Sridhar, S., Hahn, A., Govindarasu, M., Cyber-physical system security for the electric power grid (2012) Proceedings of the IEEE, 100 (1), pp. 210-224; Mitchell, R., Chen, R., Behavior rule specification-based intrusion detection for safety critical medical cyber physical systems (2015) IEEE Trans. on Dependable and Secure Computing, 12, pp. 16-30; Amin, S., Litrico, X., Sastry, S., Bayen, A.M., Cyber security of water SCADA systems-Part I: Analysis and experimentation of stealthy deception attacks (2013) IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology, 21, pp. 1963-1970; Haghighi, M.S., Mohamedpour, K., Neighbor discovery: Security challenges in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks (2010) Trends in Telecommunications Technologies.

Its success can be easily found in many real-world applications such as network intrusion detection, opinion spam detection and system fault diagnosis, to name a few. Despite their empirical success, a vast majority of existing efforts are overwhelmingly performed in an unsupervised scenario due to the expensive labeling costs of ground truth anomalies. In fact, in many scenarios, a small amount of prior human knowledge of the data is often effortless to obtain, and getting it involved in the learning process has shown to be effective in advancing many important learning tasks. Additionally, since new types of anomalies may constantly arise over time especially in an adversarial environment, the interests of human expert could also change accordingly regarding to the detected anomaly types. It brings further challenges to conventional anomaly detection algorithms as they are often applied in a batch setting and are incapable to interact with the environment. To tackle the above issues, in this paper, we investigate the problem of anomaly detection on attributed networks in an interactive setting by allowing the system to proactively communicate with the human expert in making a limited number of queries about ground truth anomalies. Our objective is to maximize the true anomalies presented to the human expert after a given budget is used up. Along with this line, we formulate the problem through the principled multi-armed bandit framework and develop a novel collaborative contextual bandit algorithm, named GraphUCB. In particular, our developed algorithm: (1) explicitly models the nodal attributes and node dependencies seamlessly in a joint framework; and (2) handles the exploration-exploitation dilemma when querying anomalies of different types.

In this paper, we study the practicality of adversarial example in the domain of network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Specifically, we investigate how adversarial examples affect the performance of deep neural network (DNN) trained to detect abnormal behaviors in the black-box model. We demonstrate that adversary can generate effective adversarial examples against DNN classifier trained for NIDS even when the internal information of the target model is isolated from the adversary. In our experiment we first train a DNN model for NIDS system using NSL-KDD database and achieve a performance matching the state-of-art literature, then we show how can an adversary generate adversary examples to mislead the model without knowing the internal information. © 2018 IEEE.","Deep learning; Intrusion detection; Security","Classification (of information); Computer crime; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Military communications; Abnormal behavior; Black-box model; Network intrusion detection systems; Performance matching; Security; Security application; Target model; Intrusion detection","Buczak, A.L., Guven, E., A survey of data mining and machine learning methods for cyber security intrusion detection (2016) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 18 (2), pp. 1153-1176; Tsai, C.-F., Hsu, Y.-F., Lin, C.-Y., Lin, W.-Y., Intrusion detection by machine learning: A review (2009) Expert Systems with Applications, 36 (10), pp. 11994-12000; Gao, N., Gao, L., Gao, Q., Wang, H., An intrusion detection model based on deep belief networks (2014) Proceedings of the Advanced Cloud and Big Data (CBD) on 2014 Second International Conference.

However, an adversarial example, created by adding a little noise to the original sample, can cause misclassification by the DNN. As adversarial examples are a serious threat to DNNs, there has been much research into the generation of adversarial examples designed for attacking DNNs. The adversarial example attack is divided into two categories: targeted adversarial example and untargeted adversarial example. The targeted adversarial example attack causes machines to misinterpret an object as the attacker's desired class. In contrast, the untargeted adversarial example causes machines to misinterpret an object as an incorrect class. In this paper, we focus on an untargeted adversarial example scenario because it has less distortion from the original sample and a faster learning time than a targeted adversarial example scenario. However, there is a pattern problem in generating untargeted adversarial examples: Because of the similarity between the original class and specific classes, it may be possible for the defending system to determine the original class by analyzing the output classes of the untargeted adversarial examples. To overcome this problem, we propose a new method for generating untargeted adversarial examples, one that uses an arbitrary class in the generation process. For experimental datasets, we used MNIST and CIFAR10, and the Tensorflow library was employed as the machine learning library. Through our experiment, we show that the proposed method can generate random untargeted adversarial examples that do not focus on a specific class for a given original class, while keeping distortion to a minimum (1.99 and 42.32 on MNIST and CIFAR10, respectively) and maintaining a 100% attack success rate. © 2018 IEEE.","Adversarial example; Deep neural network; Random selection; Untargeted adversarial example","Image recognition; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Military communications; Speech recognition; Adversarial example; Generation process; Military environment; Misclassifications; Original sample; Pattern analysis; Random selection; Untargeted adversarial example; Deep neural networks","Abadi, M., Barham, P., Chen, J., Chen, Z., Davis, A., Dean, J., Devin, M., Isard, M., Tensorflow: A system for large-scale machine learning (2016) OSDI, 16, pp. 265-283; Carlini, N., Wagner, D., Adversarial examples are not easily detected: Bypassing ten detection methods (2017) Proceedings of the 10th ACM Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Security, pp. 3-14. , ACM; Carlini, N., Wagner, D., Towards evaluating the robustness of neural networks (2017) Security and Privacy (SP), 2017 IEEE Symposium on, pp. 39-57. , IEEE; Collobert, R., Weston, J., A unified architecture for natural language processing: Deep neural networks with multitask learning (2008) Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 160-167. , ACM; Goodfellow, I., Shlens, J., Szegedy, C., Explaining and harnessing adversarial examples (2015) International Conference on Learning Representations; Hinton, G., Deng, L., Yu, D., Dahl, G.E., Mohamed, A., Jaitly, N., Senior, A., Sainath, T.N., Deep neural networks for acoustic modeling in speech recognition: The shared views of four research groups (2012) IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 29 (6), pp. 82-97; Kereliuk, C., Sturm, B.L., Larsen, J., Deep learning and music adversaries (2015) IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 17 (11), pp. 2059-2071; Krizhevsky, A., Nair, V., Hinton, G., (2014) The cifar-10 Dataset, , http://www.cs.toronto.edu/kriz/cifar.html; Kurakin, A., Goodfellow, I., Bengio, S., Adversarial examples in the physical world (2017) ICLR Workshop; Kwon, H., Kim, Y., Park, K., Yoon, H., Choi, D., Advanced ensemble adversarial example on unknown deep neural network classifiers (2018) IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems, 101 (10); LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., Haffner, P., Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition (1998) Proceedings of the IEEE, 86 (11), pp. 2278-2324; LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., Burges, C.Jc., Mnist handwritten digit database (2010) AT&T Labs, 2. , http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist; Meng, D., Chen, H., Magnet: A two-pronged defense against adversarial examples (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 135-147. , ACM; Moosavi-Dezfooli, S., Fawzi, A., Frossard, P., Deepfool: A simple and accurate method to fool deep neural networks (2016) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 2574-2582; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Goodfellow, I., Jha, S., Berkay Celik, Z., Swami, A., Practical black-box attacks against machine learning (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 506-519. , ACM; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Jha, S., Fredrikson, M., Berkay Celik, Z., Swami, A., The limitations of deep learning in adversarial settings (2016) Security and Privacy (EuroS&P), 2016 IEEE European Symposium on, pp. 372-387. , IEEE; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Wu, X., Jha, S., Swami, A., Distillation as a defense to adversarial perturbations against deep neural networks (2016) Security and Privacy (SP), 2016 IEEE Symposium on, pp. 582-597. , IEEE; Potluri, S., Diedrich, C., Accelerated deep neural networks for enhanced intrusion detection system (2016) Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA), 2016 IEEE 21st International Conference on, pp. 1-8. , IEEE; Schmidhuber, J., Deep learning in neural networks: An overview (2015) Neural Networks, 61, pp. 85-117; Simonyan, K., Zisserman, A., Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition (2015) ICLR 2015; Szegedy, C., Zaremba, W., Sutskever, I., Bruna, J., Erhan, D., Goodfellow, I., Fergus, R., Intriguing properties of neural networks (2014) International Conference on Learning Representations",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538671856,PMICE,,"English","Proc IEEE Mil Commun Conf MILCOM",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061446994

This issue limits their deployability on ubiquitous applications requiring a high level of security such as driverless system, unmanned aerial vehicle and intrusion detection. In this paper, we propose latent encodings transferring attack (LET-attack) to generate target natural adversarial examples to fool well-trained classifiers. In order to perturb in latent space, we train WGAN-variants on various datasets to achieve feature extraction, image reconstruction and image discrimination against counterfeit with good performance. Thanks to our two-stage procedure of mapping transformation, the adversary performs precise and semantic perturbations on source data referring to target data in latent space. By using the critic in WGAN-variant and the well-trained classifier, the adversary crafts more verisimilar and effective adversarial examples. As shown in the experimental results on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10 and LSUN, LET-attack can yield a distinct set of adversarial examples with partly data manifold targeted transfer and attains similar attack performance against state-of-the-art models in different attack scenarios. What is more, we evaluate LET-attack on the characteristic of transferability in different classifiers on MNIST and CIFAR-10 respectively, and find that the adversarial examples are easy to transfer with high confidence. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Adversarial example; Black-box attack; Mapping transformation; Transferability","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Conformal mapping; Deep learning; Encoding (symbols); Image reconstruction; Intrusion detection; Semantics; Adversarial example; Black boxes; Driverless systems; Image discrimination; Mapping transformation; Transferability; Two stage procedure; Ubiquitous application; Metadata","Szegedy, C., Zaremba, W., Sutskever, I., Intriguing properties of neural networks (2013) Comput.

Nevertheless, CIDNs may be vulnerable to insider attacks, and there is a great need for deploying appropriate trust management schemes to protect CIDNs in practice. In this work, we advocate the effectiveness of intrusion sensitivity-based trust management model and describe an engineering way to automatically allocate the sensitivity values by using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. To explore the allocation performance, we compare our classifier with several traditional supervised algorithms in the evaluation. We further investigate the performance of our enhanced trust management scheme in a real network environment under adversarial scenarios, and the experimental results indicate that our approach can be more effective in detecting insider attacks as compared with similar approaches. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG, 2019.","Collaborative intrusion detection; Insider threat; Intrusion sensitivity; Supervised learning; Trust management","Network security; Security systems; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; Detection performance; Insider attack; Insider Threat; Intrusion sensitivity; Sensitivity values; Supervised algorithm; Trust management; Trust management model; Intrusion detection","Auria, L., Moro, R.A., (2008) Support Vector Machines (SVM) as a Technique for Solvency Analysis, , DIW Berlin Discussion Paper no. 811; Bao, F., Chen, I.R., Chang, M., Cho, J.H., Hierarchical trust management for wireless sensor networks and its applications to trust-based routing and intrusion detection (2012) IEEE Trans.

In spite of performance losses due to Class Imbalance, this issue has not been thoroughly studied in Network Traffic Classification and some previous works are limited to few solutions and/or assumed misleading methodological approaches. In this study, we propose a method for generating network attack traffic to address data imbalance problems in training datasets. For this purpose, traffic data was analyzed based on deep packet inspection and features were extracted based on common traffic characteristics. Similar malicious traffic was generated for classes with low data counts using Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGAN) with a gradient penalty algorithm. The experiment demonstrated that the accuracy of each dataset was improved by approximately 5% and the false detection rate was reduced by approximately 8%. This study has demonstrated that enhanced learning and classification can be achieved by solving the problem of degraded performance caused by data imbalance in datasets used in deep learning based intrusion detection systems. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Deep learning; Generative adversarial network; Intrusion detection; Security","Classification (of information); Computer crime; Intrusion detection; Adversarial networks; Deep packet inspection; Degraded performance; Intrinsic features; Intrusion Detection Systems; Methodological approach; Security; Traffic characteristics; Deep learning","Tama, B.A., Rhee, K.H., Performance analysis of multiple classifier system in DoS attack detection (2016) WISA 2015.

The rich sensor data in CPSs can be continuously monitored for intrusion events through anomaly detection. On one hand, conventional supervised anomaly detection methods are unable to exploit the large amounts of data due to the lack of labelled data. On the other hand, current unsupervised machine learning approaches have not fully exploited the spatial-temporal correlation and other dependencies amongst the multiple variables (sensors/actuators) in the system when detecting anomalies. In this work, we propose an unsupervised multivariate anomaly detection method based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), using the Long-Short-Term-Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNN) as the base models (namely, the generator and discriminator) in the GAN framework to capture the temporal correlation of time series distributions. Instead of treating each data stream independently, our proposed Multivariate Anomaly Detection with GAN (MAD-GAN) framework considers the entire variable set concurrently to capture the latent interactions amongst the variables. We also fully exploit both the generator and discriminator produced by the GAN, using a novel anomaly score called DR-score to detect anomalies through discrimination and reconstruction. We have tested our proposed MAD-GAN using two recent datasets collected from real-world CPSs: the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) and the Water Distribution (WADI) datasets. Our experimental results show that the proposed MAD-GAN is effective in reporting anomalies caused by various cyber-attacks inserted in these complex real-world systems. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Anomaly detection; Cyber-physical system; Generative Adversarial Networks; Multivariate time series","Computer crime; Crime; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Intrusion detection; Long short-term memory; Machine learning; Network security; Palmprint recognition; Time series; Water supply systems; Water treatment; Adversarial networks; Anomaly detection methods; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Large amounts of data; Mission critical tasks; Multivariate time series; Spatial-temporal correlation; Unsupervised machine learning; Anomaly detection","Ahmed Chuadhry Mujeeb, V.R.P., Mathur, A.P., Wadi: A water distribution testbed for research in the design of secure cyber physical systems (2017) In Proceedings of the 3Rd International Workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems for Smart Water Networks, Pp. 25–28.

However, ML models are often susceptible to evasion attacks, in which an adversary makes changes to the input (such as malware) in order to avoid being detected. A conventional approach to evaluate ML robustness to such attacks, as well as to design robust ML, is by considering simplified feature-space models of attacks, where the attacker changes ML features directly to effect evasion, while minimizing or constraining the magnitude of this change. We investigate the effectiveness of this approach to designing robust ML in the face of attacks that can be realized in actual malware (realizable attacks). We demonstrate that in the context of structure-based PDF malware detection, such techniques appear to have limited effectiveness, but they are effective with content-based detectors. In either case, we show that augmenting the feature space models with conserved features (those that cannot be unilaterally modified without compromising malicious functionality) significantly improves performance. Finally, we show that feature space models enable generalized robustness when faced with a variety of realizable attacks, as compared to classifiers which are tuned to be robust to a specific realizable attack. © 2019 by The USENIX Association.

Even worse, the network intrusion samples are submerged into a large number of normal data packets, which leads to insufficient samples for model training; therefore it is accompanied by high false detection rates. To address the challenge of unbalanced positive and negative learning samples, we propose using deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN), which allows features to be extracted directly from the rawdata, and then generates new training-sets by learning from the rawdata. Given the fact that the attack samples are usually intra-dependent time sequence data, we apply long short-term memory (LSTM) to automatically learn the features of network intrusion behaviors. However, it is hard to parallelize the learning/training of the LSTM network, since the LSTM algorithm depends on the result of the previous moment. To remove such dependency and enable intrusion detection in real time, we propose a simple recurrent unit based (SRU)-based model. The proposed model was verified by extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets KDD'99 and NSL-KDD, which effectively identifies normal and abnormal network activities. It achieves 99.73% accuracy on the KDD'99 dataset and 99.62% on the NSL-KDD dataset. © 2019 IEEE.","deep convolutional generative adversarial networks; deep learning; intrusion detection system (IDS); Network security; simple recurrent unit","Clustering algorithms; Computer crime; Convolution; Deep learning; Extraction; Intrusion detection; Network security; Adversarial networks; High dimensional data; Intrusion Detection Systems; Model-based intrusion detection; Network activities; Network intrusions; simple recurrent unit; Time sequence data; Long short-term memory","Gupta, O., Raskar, R., Distributed learning of deep neural network over multiple agents (2018) J.

Therefore, data safety and privacy protection are increasingly reliant on these models. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Random Forests (RF) are two of the most widely-used, accurate classifiers which have been applied to malware detection. Although their effectiveness has been promising, the recent adversarial machine learning research raises the concerns on their robustness and resilience against being attacked or poisoned by adversarial samples. In this particular research, we evaluate the performance of two adversarial sample generation algorithms - Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA) and Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) on poisoning the deep neural networks and random forests models for function call graph based malware detection. The returned results show that FGSM and JSMA gained high success rates by modifying the samples to pass through the trained DNN and RF models. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adversarial Machine Learning; Graphlet; Neural Network; Random Forest","Application programs; Computer crime; Decision trees; Graphic methods; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Malware; Neural networks; Antivirus softwares; Computing technology; Function-call graphs; Graphlet; Machine learning research; Random forest classifier; Random forests; Sample generations; Deep neural networks","Hu, W., Tan, Y., (2017) Generating Adversarial Malware Examples for Black-Box Attacks Based on GAN; Subasi, A., Molah, E., Almkallawi, F., Chaudhery, T.J., Intelligent phishing website detection using random forest classifier (2017) In: 2017 International Conference on Electrical and Computing Technologies and Applications (ICECTA), Ras Al Khaimah, pp. 1-5. , pp; Peng, W., Gao, T., Sisodia, D., Saha, T.K., Li, F., Al Hasan, M., ACTS: Extracting android app topological signature through graphlet sampling (2016) 2016 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS), pp. 37-45. , pp; Bosch, A., Zisserman, A., Munoz, X., Image classification using random forests and ferns (2007) 2007 IEEE 11Th International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 1-8. , Rio de Janeiro, pp; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Jha, S., Fredrikson, M., Celik, Z.B., Swami, A., The limitations of deep learning in adversarial settings (2016) Proceedings of the 1St IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 372-387. , pp; Feinman, R., Curtin, R.R., Shintre, S., Gardner, A.B., (2017) Detecting Adversarial Samples from Artifacts; Papernot, N., Carlini, N., Goodfellow, I., Feinman, R., (2016) Cleverhans V2. 0.0: An Adversarial Machine Learning Library; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Jha, S., Fredrikson, M., Celik, Z.B., Swami, A., The limitations of deep learning in adversarial settings (2016) IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (Euros, P), Saarbrucken, pp. 372-387. , pp; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Goodfellow, I., Jha, S., Celik, Z.B., Swami, A., Practical black-box attacks against machine learning (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ASIA CCS 2017), pp. 506-519. , https://doi.org/10.1145/3052973.3053009, pp., ACM, New York; Gao, T., (2018) Android Malware Detection via Graphlet Sampling, pp. 1-14. , pp., Unpublished; (2016) The WEKA Workbench: Online Appendix for “Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques�?, 4Th Edn, , Morgan Kaufmann; Goodfellow, I.J., Explaining and harnessing adversarial examples (2015) Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations; Dang, H., Huang, Y., Chang, E., Evading classifiers by morphing in the dark (2017) ACM CCS, pp. 119-133. , pp., ACM; Holczer, B., Random Forest Classifier-Machine Learning (2018) Global Software Support, , www.globalsoftwaresupport.com/random-forest-classifier-bagging-machine-learning/; Elsayed, G., Goodfellow, I., Sohl-Dickstein, J., (2018) Adversarial Reprogramming of Neural Networks, , https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11146.pdf, Accessed 22 Oct 2018; Grosse, K., Papernot, N., Manoharan, P., Backes, M., McDaniel, P., ; Jia, J., Gong, N.Z., ; Kreuk, F., (2018) Deceiving End-To-End Deep Learning Malware Detectors Using Adversarial Examples, , https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04528.pdf, Accessed 22 Oct 2018","Luo, X.; Department of CIT, United States; email: luo25@iupui.edu","Garcia-Alfaro J.Debbabi M.Zincir-Heywood N.Bonfante G.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783030184186,,,"English","Lect.

In this paper, we propose a one-pixel adversarial example that is safe for friendly deep neural networks. By modifying only one pixel, our proposed method generates a one-pixel-safe adversarial example that can be misclassified by an enemy classifier and correctly classified by a friendly classifier. To verify the performance of the proposed method, we used the CIFAR-10 dataset, ResNet model classifiers, and the Tensorflow library in our experiments. Results show that the proposed method modified only one pixel to achieve success rates of 13.5% and 26.0% in targeted and untargeted attacks, respectively. The success rate is slightly lower than that of the conventional one-pixel method, which has success rates of 15% and 33.5% in targeted and untargeted attacks, respectively; however, this method protects 100% of the friendly classifiers. In addition, if the proposed method modifies five pixels, this method can achieve success rates of 20.5% and 52.0% in targeted and untargeted attacks, respectively. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Adversarial example; Deep neural network (DNN); Differential evolution (DE); One-pixel attack","Classification (of information); Evolutionary algorithms; Image recognition; Intrusion detection; Optimization; Pixels; Speech recognition; Adversarial example; Differential Evolution; One-pixel attack; Pattern analysis; Pixel methods; Deep neural networks","Abadi, M., TensorFlow: A system for large-scale machine learning (2016) OSDI, 16, pp. 265-283; Carlini, N., Wagner, D., Towards evaluating the robustness of neural networks (2017) 2017 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP), pp. 39-57. , IEEE; Das, S., Suganthan, P.N., Differential evolution: A survey of the state-of-the-art (2011) IEEE Trans.

In this paper, an anomaly-based intrusion detection system using Haar wavelet transforms in combination with an adversarial autoencoder was developed for detecting malicious TLS-encrypted Internet traffic. Data containing legitimate, as well as advanced malicious traffic was collected from a large-scale cyber exercise and used in the analysis. Based on the findings and domain expertise, a set of features for distinguishing modern malware from packet timing analysis were chosen and evaluated. Performance of the adversarial autoencoder was compared with a traditional autoencoder. The results indicate that the adversarial model performs better than the traditional autoencoder. In addition, a machine learning pipeline capable of analyzing traffic in near real time was developed for data analysis. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Adversarial autoencoder; Anomaly detection; Haar wavelets; Intrusion detection","Anomaly detection; Computer crime; Cryptography; Learning systems; Malware; Wavelet transforms; Anomaly based intrusion detection systems; Auto encoders; Domain expertise; Haar wavelet transform; Haar wavelets; Malicious traffic; Network intrusion detection; Networked systems; Intrusion detection","Apache Kafka: Apache Kafka a Distributed Streaming Platform, , https://kafka.apache.org/, Accessed 31 Aug 2018; Apache Spark: Apache Spark Lightning-Fast Unified Analytics Engine, , https://spark.apache.org, Accessed 31 Aug 2018; Chan, K., Fu, W., Efficient time series matching by wavelets (1999) Proceedings 15Th International Conference on Data Engineering (Cat.

Many SDN-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been proposed in recent researches. On the other hand, deep learning has emerged as an explosive growth in research and industry. The application of deep learning on IDS has been studied in many security-critical scenarios. However, some reports has indicated the vulnerability of adversarial attacks on deep learning IDS system with intentional perturbation injection or manipulation. It is important for the empowered IDS system employing deep learning to be responsible for not leading misclassification. Therefore, exploring the impact on the adversarial attacks over SDN networks or security-critical scenarios applying deep learning is an important step to confront such urgent issues. In this paper, we will conduct the SDN-based experiments on adversarial attacks for deep learning detecting system. We propose a novel class of adversarial attacks that exploits the vulnerability of the deep learning classifiers in SDN environment. Three typical deep learning models combining with four different adversarial testing will be conducted in the simulation for complete analysis. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Adversarial attacks; Deep learning; IDS; SDN","Explosives; Industrial research; Intrusion detection; Network architecture; Network security; Wireless telecommunication systems; Adversarial attacks; Detecting systems; Intrusion Detection Systems; Learning classifiers; Misclassifications; Recent researches; Security-critical; Software defined networking (SDN); Deep learning","https://www.opennetworking.org/sdndefinition/; https://pentest-tools.com/network-vulnerability-scanning/tcp-port-scanner-online-nmap; https://nmap.org/; Almeida, L.B., (1997) Multilayer Perceptrons, in Handbook of Neural Computation, , IOP Publishing Ltd and Oxford University Press; Lecun, Y., Lenet-5, Convolutional Neural Networks, , Retrieved 16 November 2013 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); Sepp, H., Jürgen, S., Long short-term memory (1997) Neural Comput, 9 (8), pp. 1735-1780. , 9377276; Yuan, X., He, P., Zhu, Q., Bhat, R., Li, X., (2017) Adversarial Examples: Attacks and Defenses for Deep Learning At, , https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321936593; Goodfellow, I.J., Shlens, J., Szegedy, C., (2014) Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Goodfellow, I., Jha, S., Celik, Z.B., Swami, A., (2016) Practical Black-Box Attacks against Deep Learning Systems Using Adversarial Examples.

Adversarial machine learning offers an approach to increase our understanding of these models. In this paper we present an approach to generate explanations for incorrect classifications made by data-driven Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) An adversarial approach is used to find the minimum modifications (of the input features) required to correctly classify a given set of misclassified samples. The magnitude of such modifications is used to visualize the most relevant features that explain the reason for the misclassification. The presented methodology generated satisfactory explanations that describe the reasoning behind the mis-classifications, with descriptions that match expert knowledge. The advantages of the presented methodology are: 1) applicable to any classifier with defined gradients. 2) does not require any modification of the classifier model. 3) can be extended to perform further diagnosis (e.g. vulnerability assessment) and gain further understanding of the system. Experimental evaluation was conducted on the NSL-KDD99 benchmark dataset using Linear and Multilayer perceptron classifiers. The results are shown using intuitive visualizations in order to improve the interpretability of the results. © 2018 IEEE.","Adversarial Machine Learning; Adversarial samples; Cyber-security; Explainable AI","Computer crime; Deep neural networks; Industrial electronics; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Benchmark datasets; Cyber security; Experimental evaluation; Intrusion Detection Systems; Misclassifications; Multi-layer perceptron classifiers; Relevant features; Vulnerability assessments; Classification (of information)","Kwon, D., Kim, H., Kim, J., Suh, S.C., Kim, I., Kim, K.J., A survey of deep learning-based network anomaly detection (2017) Cluster Computing, , https://doi.org/10.1007/s10586-017-1117-8, Sep Online; Sridhar, B.S., Hahn, A., Govindarasu, M., (2012) Cyber Physical System Security for the Electric Power Grid, 100 (1); Raj, R., Lee, I., Stankovic, J., (2010) Cyber-Physical Systems: The Next Computing Revolution, pp. 731-736; Alvaro, A.C., Challenges for Securing Cyber Physical Systems; Lee, W.L.W., Stolfo, S.J., Mok, K.W., A data mining framework for building intrusion detection models (1999) Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy Cat No99CB36344, pp. 120-132. , http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=766909, 00,.

The emergence of the Internet of Things has aggregated this growth. Lack of security in an IoT world makes these devices hot targets for cyber criminals to perform their malicious actions. One of these actions is the Botnet attack, which is one of the main destructive threats that has been evolving since 2003 into different forms. This attack is a serious threat to the security and privacy of information. Its scalability, structure, strength, and strategy are also under successive development, and that it has survived for decades. A bot is defined as a software application that executes a number of automated tasks (simple but structurally repetitive) over the Internet. Several bots make a botnet that infects a number of devices and communicates with their controller called the botmaster to get their instructions. A botnet executes tasks with a rate that would be impossible to be done by a human being. Nowadays, the activities of bots are concealed in between the normal web flows and occupy more than half of all web traffic. The largest use of bots is in web spidering (web crawler), in which an automated script fetches, analyzes, and files information from web servers. They also contribute to other attacks, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS), SPAM, identity theft, phishing, and espionage. A number of botnet detection techniques have been proposed, such as honeynet-based and Intrusion Detection System (IDS)-based. These techniques are not effective anymore due to the constant update of the bots and their evasion mechanisms. Recently, botnet detection techniques based upon machine/deep learning have been proposed that are more capable in comparison to their previously mentioned counterparts. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based engine for botnet detection to be utilized in the IoT and the wearable devices. In this system, the normal and botnet network traffic data are transformed into image before being given into a deep convolutional neural network, named DenseNet with and without considering transfer learning. The system is implemented using Python programming language and the CTU-13 Dataset is used for evaluation in one study. According to our simulation results, using transfer learning can improve the accuracy from 33.41% up to 99.98%. In addition, two other classifiers of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and logistic regression have been used. They showed an accuracy of 83.15% and 78.56%, respectively. In another study, we evaluate our system by an in-house live normal dataset and a solely botnet dataset. Similarly, the system performed very well in data classification in these studies. To examine the capability of our system for real-time applications, we measure the system training and testing times. According to our examination, it takes 0.004868 milliseconds to process each packet from the network traffic data during testing. © 2018 by the authors.

On one hand, AI technologies, such as deep learning, can be introduced into cyber security to construct smart models for implementing malware classification and intrusion detection and threating intelligence sensing. On the other hand, AI models will face various cyber threats, which will disturb their sample, learning, and decisions. Thus, AI models need specific cyber security defense and protection technologies to combat adversarial machine learning, preserve privacy in machine learning, secure federated learning, etc. Based on the above two aspects, we review the intersection of AI and cyber security. First, we summarize existing research efforts in terms of combating cyber attacks using AI, including adopting traditional machine learning methods and existing deep learning solutions. Then, we analyze the counterattacks from which AI itself may suffer, dissect their characteristics, and classify the corresponding defense methods. Finally, from the aspects of constructing encrypted neural network and realizing a secure federated deep learning, we expatiate the existing research on how to build a secure AI system. © 2018, Editorial Office of Journal of Zhejiang University Science and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence (AI);

However, it has been revealed that DNNs have weaknesses in the face of adversarial examples, which are created by adding a little noise to an original sample to cause misclassification by the DNN. Such adversarial examples can lead to fatal accidents in applications such as autonomous vehicles and disease diagnostics. Thus, the generation of adversarial examples has attracted extensive research attention recently. An adversarial example is categorized as targeted or untargeted. In this paper, we focus on the untargeted adversarial example scenario because it has a faster learning time and less distortion compared with the targeted adversarial example. However, there is a pattern vulnerability with untargeted adversarial examples: Because of the similarity between the original class and certain specific classes, it may be possible for the defending system to determine the original class by analyzing the output classes of the untargeted adversarial examples. To overcome this problem, we propose a new method for generating untargeted adversarial examples, one that uses an arbitrary class in the generation process. Moreover, we show that our proposed scheme can be applied to steganography. Through experiments, we show that our proposed scheme can achieve a 100% attack success rate with minimum distortion (1.99 and 42.32 using the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, respectively) and without the pattern vulnerability. Using a steganography test, we show that our proposed scheme can be used to fool humans, as demonstrated by the probability of their detecting hidden classes being equal to that of random selection. © 2018 by the authors.","Adversarial example; Deep neural network; Random selection; Untargeted adversarial example",,"Schmidhuber, J., Deep learning in neural networks: An overview (2015) Neural Netw, 61, pp. 85-117; Szegedy, C., Zaremba, W., Sutskever, I., Bruna, J., Erhan, D., Goodfellow, I., Fergus, R., Intriguing properties of neural networks (2014) Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations, , Banff, AB, Canada, 14-16 April; LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., Burges, C.J., MNIST Handwritten Digit Database (2010) AT&T Labs, 2. , http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist, (accessed on 4 December 2018 ); Kwon, H., Kim, Y., Yoon, H., Choi, D., Fooling a Neural Network in Military Environments: Random Untargeted Adversarial Example (2018) Proceedings of the Military Communications Conference, , Los Angeles, CA, USA, 29-31 October; Cheddad, A., Condell, J., Curran, K., Mc Kevitt, P., Digital image steganography: Survey and analysis of current methods (2010) Signal Process, 90, pp. 727-752; Krizhevsky, A., Nair, V., Hinton, G., (2014) The CIFAR-10 Dataset, , http://www.cs.toronto.edu/kriz/cifar.html, (accessed on 4 December 2018 ); Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J., The security of machine learning (2010) Mach.

In this paper, an enhanced Hidden Markov Model, called the Anti-Adversarial Hidden Markov Model (AA-HMM), is proposed to effectively detect evasion pattern, using the DynamicWindow and Threshold techniques to achieve adaptive, anti-adversarial, and online-learning abilities. In addition, a concept called Pattern Entropy is defined and acts as the foundation of AA-HMM.We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach employing two well-known benchmark data sets, NSL-KDD and CTU-13, in terms of the common performance metrics and the algorithm's adaptation and anti-adversary abilities. © 2017 by the authors.","Adaptability; Adversarial setting; Anti-Adversarial Hidden Markov Model (AA-HMM); Dynamic window (DW); Evasion patterns; Network intrusion detection; Pattern entropy (PE); Threshold (TH)",,"Sommer, R., Paxson, V., Outside the Closed World-On Using Machine Learning for Network Intrusion Detection (2010) Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, , Berkeley/Oakland, CA, USA, 16-19 May; Linden, G., Smith, B., York, J., Amazon.com recommendations: Item-to-item collaborative filtering (2003) IEEE Internet Comput, 7, pp. 76-80; Gomez-Uribe, C.A., Hunt, N., The Netflix Recommender System: Algorithms, Business Value, and Innovation (2016) ACM Trans.

However, recent research efforts have shown that, especially within the image processing field, these novel techniques are susceptible to adversarial perturbations. In this paper, we present an analysis that highlights and evaluates experimentally the fragility of network intrusion detection systems based on machine learning algorithms against adversarial attacks. In particular, our study involves a random forest classifier that utilizes network flows to distinguish between botnet and benign samples. Our results, derived from experiments performed on a public real dataset of labelled network flows, show that attackers can easily evade such defensive mechanisms by applying slight and targeted modifications to the network activity generated by their controlled bots. These findings pave the way for future techniques that aim to strengthen the performance of machine learning-based network intrusion detection systems. © 2018 IEEE.","Adversarial samples; botnet; flow inspection; intrusion detection; machine learning; random forest","Artificial intelligence; Botnet; Computer crime; Decision trees; Image processing; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Autonomous capability; Defensive mechanism; Network activities; Network intrusion detection systems; Novel techniques; Random forest classifier; Random forests; Recent researches; Learning algorithms","Jordan, M.I., Mitchell, T.M., Machine learning: Trends, perspectives, and prospects (2015) Science; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Jha, S., Fredrikson, M., Celik, Z.B., Swami, A., The limitations of deep learning in adversarial settings (2016) Security and Privacy (EuroS&P), 2016 IEEE European Symposium on, , IEEE; Biggio, B., Corona, I., Maiorca, D., Nelson, B., Srndic, N., Laskov, P., Giacinto, G., Roli, F., Evasion attacks against machine learning at test time (2013) Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases, , Springer; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Sinha, A., Wellman, M., (2016) Towards the Science of Security and Privacy in Machine Learning; Su, J., Vargas, D.V., Kouichi, S., (2017) One Pixel Attack for Fooling Deep Neural Networks; Apruzzese, G., Colajanni, M., Ferretti, L., Guido, A., Marchetti, M., On the effectiveness of machine and deep learning for cybersecurity (2018) International Conference on Cyber Conflicts (CyCon), 2018 NATO.

It plays an important role in many domains such as network intrusion detection, criminal activity identity and so on. With the rapidly growing size of accessible training data and high computation capacities, deep learning based anomaly detection has become more and more popular. In this paper, a new domain-based anomaly detection method based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) is proposed. Minimum likelihood regularization is proposed to make the generator produce more anomalies and prevent it from converging to normal data distribution. Proper ensemble of anomaly scores is shown to improve the stability of discriminator effectively. The proposed method has achieved significant improvement than other anomaly detection methods on Cifar10 and UCI datasets. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Deep learning; Intrusion detection; Adversarial networks; Anomaly detection; Anomaly detection methods; Computation capacity; Criminal activities; Data distribution; Network intrusion detection; Training data; Pattern recognition","Ando, S., Clustering needles in a haystack: An information theoretic analysis of minority and outlier detection (2007) Seventh IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, pp. 13-22. , IEEE; Angelov, P., An approach for fuzzy rule-base adaptation using on-line clustering (2004) International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 35 (3), pp. 275-289; Augusteijn, M.F., Folkert, B.A., Neural network classification and novelty detection (2002) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 23 (14), pp. 2891-2902; Campbell, C., Bennett, K.P., A linear programming approach to novelty detection (2001) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 395-401; Chalapathy, R., Krishna Menon, A., Chawla, S., (2017) Robust, Deep and Inductive Anomaly Detection, , arXiv preprint arXiv: 1704. 06743; Chang, C., Lin, C., Libsvm: A library for support vector machines (2011) ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 2 (3), p. 27; Chatzigiannakis, V., Papavassiliou, S., Grammatikou, M., Maglaris, B., Hierarchical anomaly detection in distributed largescale sensor networks (2006) 11th IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications, pp. 761-767. , IEEE; Clifton, D.A., Bannister, P.R., Tarassenko, L., Learning shape for jet engine novelty detection (2006) International Symposium on Neural Networks, pp. 828-835. , Springer; Dai, Z., Yang, Z., Yang, F., Cohen, W.W., Salakhutdinov, R., (2017) Good Semi-supervised Learning That Requires A Bad Gan, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1705. 09783; Du, B., Zhang, L., A discriminative metric learning based anomaly detection method (2014) IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 52 (11), pp. 6844-6857; Du, B., Zhao, R., Zhang, L., Zhang, L., A spectral-spatial based local summation anomaly detection method for hyperspectral images (2016) Signal Processing, 124, pp. 115-131. , Big Data Meets Multimedia Analytics; Eghbal-Zadeh, H., Widmer, G., (2017) Likelihood Estimation for Generative Adversarial Networks, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1707. 07530; Erdogmus, D., Jenssen, R., Rao, Y.N., Principe, J.C., Multivariate density estimation with optimal marginal parzen density estimation and Gaussianization (2004) Machine Learning for Signal Processing.

However, CAN bus is not enough to protect itself because of lack of security features. To detect suspicious network connections effectively, the intrusion detection system (IDS) is strongly required. Unlike the traditional IDS for Internet, there are small number of known attack signatures for vehicle networks. Also, IDS for vehicle requires high accuracy because any false-positive error can seriously affect the safety of the driver. To solve this problem, we propose a novel IDS model for in-vehicle networks, GIDS (GAN based Intrusion Detection System) using deep-learning model, Generative Adversarial Nets. GIDS can learn to detect unknown attacks using only normal data. As experiment result, GIDS shows high detection accuracy for four unknown attacks. © 2018 IEEE.","Controller Area Network; generative Adversarial Nets; in-vehicle security; intrusion detection System","Computer crime; Control system synthesis; Controllers; Deep learning; Intrusion detection; Process control; Vehicles; Controller area network; Controller area networkbus; Electronic control units; generative Adversarial Nets; In-vehicle networks; Intrusion Detection Systems; Network connection; Vehicle security; Network security","Song, H.M., Kim, H.R., Kim, H.K., Intrusion detection system based on the analysis of time intervals of can messages for in-vehicle network (2016) Information Networking (ICOIN). 2016 International Conference On., pp. 63-68. , IEEE; Lee, H., Jeong, S.H., Kim, H.K., Otids: A Novel Intrusion Detection System for In-vehicle Network by Using Remote Frame; Hoppe, T., Kiltz, S., Dittmann, J., Security threats to automotive can networks-practical examples and selected short-Term countermeasures (2008) Computer Safety, Reliability, and Security, pp. 235-248; Müter, M., Asaj, N., Entropy-based anomaly detection for in-vehicle networks (2011) Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV). 2011 IEEE, pp. 1110-1115. , IEEE; Marchetti, M., Stabili, D., Anomaly detection of can bus messages through analysis of sequences (2017) Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV). 2017 IEEE, pp. 1577-1583. , IEEE; Salman, N., Bresch, M., Design and Implementation of An Intrusion Detection System (Ids) for In-vehicle Networks; Zhang, M., Xu, B., Bai, S., Lu, S., Lin, Z., A deep learning method to detect web attacks using a specially designed cnn (2017) International Conference on Neural Information Processing., pp. 828-836. , Springer; Schlegl, T., Seeböck, P., Waldstein, S.M., Schmidt-Erfurth, U., Langs, G., Unsupervised anomaly detection with generative adversarial networks to guide marker discovery (2017) International Conference on Information Processing in Medical Imaging., pp. 146-157. , Springer; Goodfellow, I., Pouget-Abadie, J., Mirza, M., Xu, B., Warde-Farley, D., Ozair, S., Courville, A., Bengio, Y., Generative adversarial nets (2014) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2672-2680",,"Deng R.H.Marsh S.Nurse J.Lu R.Sezer S.Miller P.Chen L.McLaughlin K.Ghorbani A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538674932,,,"English","Annu.

The role of Intrusion Detection System within security architecture is to improve a security level by identification of all malicious and also suspicious events that could be observed in computer or network system. One of the more specific research areas related to intrusion detection is anomaly detection. Anomaly-based intrusion detection in networks refers to the problem of finding untypical events in the observed network traffic that do not conform to the expected normal patterns. It is assumed that everything that is untypical/anomalous could be dangerous and related to some security events. To detect anomalies many security systems implements a classification or clustering algorithms. However, recent research proved that machine learning models might misclassify adversarial events, e.g. observations which were created by applying intentionally non-random perturbations to the dataset. Such weakness could increase of false negative rate which implies undetected attacks. This fact can lead to one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities of intrusion detection systems. The goal of the research performed was verification of the anomaly detection systems ability to resist this type of attack. This paper presents the preliminary results of tests taken to investigate existence of attack vector, which can use adversarial examples to conceal a real attack from being detected by intrusion detection systems. © 2018 IEEE.","Adversarial examples; Anomaly detection; intrusion detection systems","Chemical detection; Clustering algorithms; Computer crime; Computer networks; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Network security; Adversarial examples; Anomaly detection; Anomaly detection systems; Anomaly-based intrusion detection; Intrusion Detection Systems; Machine learning models; Random perturbations; Security Architecture; Intrusion detection","Smaha, S.E., Haystack: An intrusion detection system (1988) Fourth Aerospace Computer Security Applications Conference, pp. 37-44. , IEEE, Orlando, FL, USA; Bhuyan, M.H., Bhattacharyya, D.K., Kalita, J.K., Network anomaly detection : Methods, systems and tools (2014) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorial, 16 (1), pp. 303-336; Szegedy, C., Zaremba, W., Sutskever, I., Bruna, J., Erhan, D., Goodfellow, I.J., Fergus, R., (2013) Intriguing Properties of Neural Networks, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1312. 6199; Goodfellow, I.J., Shlens, J., Szegedy, C., (2014) Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1412. 6572; Butti, L., Presentation: Wi-Fi Advanced Fuzzing, , http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-07/Butti/Presentation/bh-eu-07-Butti.pdf, last accessed 2017/05/30; Stolfo, S.J., Fan, W., Lee, W., Prodromidis, A., Chan, P.K., Cost-based modeling for fraud and intrusion detection: Results from the JAM project (2000) Proc. of the DARPA Information Survivability Conference and Exposition, 2, pp. 130-144. , USA: IEEE CS; Tavallaee, M., Bagheri, E., Lu, W., Ghorbani, A.A., A detailed analysis of the KDD CUP 99 data set (2009) Proc. of the 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Security and Defense Applications, pp. 53-58. , USA: IEEE Press; Revathi, S., Malathi, A., (2013) A Detailed Analysis on NSL-KDD Dataset Using Various Machine Learning Techniques for Intrusion Detection; (2009) NSL-KDD Data Set for Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems, , http://iscx.cs.unb.ca/NSL-KDD/, NSL-KDD, March; Brugger, T., Post KDD Cup '99 Dataset (Network Intrusion) Considered Harmful, , http://www.kdnuggets.com/news/2007/n18/4i.html, last, last accessed 2017/05/30; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Jha, S., Fredrikson, M., Celik, Z.B., Swami, A., The limitations of deep learning in adversarial settings (2016) Proceedings of the 1st IEEE European Symposium in Security and Privacy (EuroS&P); Grosse, K., Papernot, N., Manoharan, P., Backes, M., McDaniel, P., (2016) Adversarial Perturbations Against Deep Neural Networks for Malware Classification, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1606. 04435; Kurakin, A., Goodfellow, I., Bengio, S., (2016) Adversarial Examples in the Physical World, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1607. 02533; Carlini, N., Mishra, P., Vaidya, T., Zhang, Y., Sherr, M., Shields, C., Wagner, D., Zhou, W., Hidden voice commands (2016) USENIX Security Symposium, pp. 513-530",,"Angelov P.Yildirim T.Iliadis L.Manolopoulos Y.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538651506,,,"English","IEEE (SMC) Int.

This paper formulates the generic target tracking problem as a time-varying optimization problem and puts forth an inexact online gradient descent method for solving it sequentially. The performance of the proposed algorithm is studied by characterizing its dynamic regret, a notion common to the online learning literature. Building upon the existing results, we provide improved regret rates that not only allow non-strongly convex costs but also explicating the role of the cumulative gradient error. The objective function is convex but the variable belongs to a compact domain. The efficacy of the proposed inexact gradient framework is established on a multi-agent multi-target tracking problem. © 2018 IEEE.","Gradient descent methods; Stochastic optimization; Target tracking; Time varying optimization",,"Derenick, J.C., A convex optimization framework for multi-agent motion planning (2009) ProQuest; Tu, S., Sayed, A.H., On the influence of informed agents on learning and adaptation over networks (2013) IEEE Trans.

Recently proposed adversarial examples-slightly modified data that lead to incorrect classification-are a severe threat to the security of DNNs. In some situations, however, an adversarial example might be useful, such as when deceiving an enemy classifier on the battlefield. In such a scenario, it is necessary that a friendly classifier not be deceived. In this paper, we propose a friend-safe adversarial example, meaning that the friendly machine can classify the adversarial example correctly. To produce such examples, a transformation is carried out to minimize the probability of incorrect classification by the friend and that of correct classification by the adversary. We suggest two configurations for the scheme: targeted and untargeted class attacks. We performed experiments with this scheme using the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. Our proposed method shows a 100% attack success rate and 100% friend accuracy with only a small distortion: 2.18 and 1.54 for the two respective MNIST configurations, and 49.02 and 27.61 for the two respective CIFAR10 configurations. Additionally, we propose a new covert channel scheme and a mixed battlefield application for consideration in further applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Adversarial Example; Covert Channel; Deep Neural Network; Evasion Attack; Machine Learning","Artificial intelligence; Image recognition; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Adversarial Example; Covert channels; Evasion Attack; Pattern analysis; Deep neural networks","Abadi, M., Barham, P., Chen, J., Chen, Z., Davis, A., Dean, J., Devin, M., Isard, M., Tensorflow: a system for large-scale machine learning (2016) Proceedings of the OSDI, 16, pp. 265-283; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J., The security of machine learning (2010) Mach Learn, 81 (2), pp. 121-148; Biggio, B., Fumera, G., Roli, F., Security evaluation of pattern classifiers under attack (2014) IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng, 26 (4), pp. 984-996; Biggio, B., Nelson, B., Laskov, P., Poisoning attacks against support vector machines (2012) Proceedings of the 29th international conference on international conference on machine learning, pp. 1467-1474. , Omnipress; Carlini, N., Mishra, P., Vaidya, T., Zhang, Y., Sherr, M., Shields, C., Wagner, D., Zhou, W., Hidden voice commands (2016) Proceedings of the USENIX security symposium, pp. 513-530; Carlini, N., Wagner, D., (2017) Adversarial examples are not easily detected: Bypassing ten detection methods.

Recently, the adversarial example attack, in which the input data are only slightly modified, although not an issue for human interpretation, is a serious threat to a DNN as an attack as it causes the machine to misinterpret the data. The adversarial example attack has been receiving considerable attention owing to its potential threat to machine learning. It is divided into two categories: targeted adversarial example and untargeted adversarial example. The untargeted adversarial example happens when machines misclassify an object into an incorrect class. In contrast, the targeted adversarial example attack causes machines to misinterpret the image as the attacker's desired class. Thus, the latter is a more elaborate and powerful attack than the former. The existing targeted adversarial example is a single targeted attack that allows only one class to be recognized. However, in some cases, a multi-targeted adversarial example can be useful for an attacker to make multiple models recognize a single original image as different classes. For example, an attacker can use a single road sign generated by a multi-targeted adversarial example scheme to make model A recognize it as a stop sign and model B recognize it as a left turn, whereas a human might recognize it as a right turn. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multi-targeted adversarial example that attacks multiple models within each target class with a single modified image. To produce such examples, we carried out a transformation to maximize the probability of different target classes by multiple models. We used the MNIST datasets and TensorFlow library for our experiment. The experimental results showed that the proposed scheme for generating a multi-targeted adversarial example achieved a 100% attack success rate. © 2013 IEEE.","adversarial example; Deep neural network (DNN); evasion attack; machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Image recognition; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Speech recognition; Traffic signs; Adversarial Example; Different class; Evasion Attack; Original images; Pattern analysis; Potential threats; Target class; Targeted attacks; Deep neural networks","Abadi, M., TensorFlow: A system for large-scale machine learning (2016) Proc.

This paper proposes the use of GANs for generating network traffic in order to mimic other types of traffic. In particular, our method modifies the network behavior of a real malware in order to mimic the traffic of a legitimate application, and therefore avoid detection. By modifying the source code of a malware to receive parameters from a GAN, it was possible to adapt the behavior of its Command and Control (C2) channel to mimic the behavior of Facebook chat network traffic. In this way, it was possible to avoid the detection of new-generation Intrusion Prevention Systems that use machine learning and behavioral characteristics. A real-life scenario was successfully implemented using the Stratosphere behavioral IPS in a router, while the malware and the GAN were deployed in the local network of our laboratory, and the C2 server was deployed in the cloud. Results show that a GAN can successfully modify the traffic of a malware to make it undetectable. The modified malware also tested if it was being blocked and used this information as a feedback to the GAN. This work envisions the possibility of self-adapting malware and self-adapting IPS. © 2018 IEEE.","GAN; Intrusion detection; Intrusion prevention; Malware; Network behavior; Network traffic obfuscation","Computer crime; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Adversarial networks; Behavioral characteristics; Command and control (C2); Intrusion prevention; Intrusion prevention systems; Local networks; Network behaviors; Network traffic; Malware","Garcia, S., Modelling the network behaviour of malware to block malicious patterns.

High profile cases demonstrate the serious consequences of successful attacks. The problem has been studied for many years, leading to a number of technologies and products that have been deployed widely in government and commercial enterprises. A fundamental question is: how well do these systems work? How may they be tested? How expensive are widely deployed monitoring infrastructures in terms of computational cost? Measurement of real systems, which are dynamic in nature, encounter unknown configuration bugs and have sensitivities to the vagaries of human nature and adversarial behavior, requires a formal means to continuously test and evaluate deployed detection systems. We present a framework to deploy in situ simulated user bots (SUBs) that can emulate the actions of real users. By creating a user account and by running a host in the enterprise network, a SUB can be introduced into an enterprise system that runs at a realistic pace and does not interfere with normal operations. Infusing malicious behavior into the SUB should be detected by the insider threat monitoring infrastructure. The SUB framework can be controlled to explore the limits of deployed systems and to test the effectiveness of insider evasion tactics, especially low and slow behaviors. We demonstrate our framework in a synthetic ecosystem as well as in a live enterprise deployment. We created a synthetic environment of users based on data collected in a West Point cadet study. Various machine learning based intrusion detection algorithms are used to validate the ability of the SUB framework to generate both normal and malicious users. In a live University network, we launched a number of attacks on its intrusion detection system and showcased the ability to devise malicious users. In addition, we further deployed low and slow attacks that perform malicious actions over an extended period of time and demonstrate how even a large enterprise is ill equipped to combat such attacks. © 2018 IEEE.","Generative adversarial networks; Intrusion detection system monitoring; Machine learning; Machine learning and security; Simulated user bots","Artificial intelligence; Botnet; Computer crime; Learning systems; Network security; Program debugging; Real time systems; Adversarial networks; Commercial enterprise; Enterprise networks; Insider threat detections; Intrusion detection algorithms; Intrusion Detection Systems; Simulated user bots; Synthetic environments; Intrusion detection","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/observeit, [Online]; https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/niara-inc, [Online]; https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/alphasoc, [Online]; (2015) Market Guide for User and Entity Behavior Analytics, , https://www.gartner.com/doc/3134524/market-guide-user-entity-behavior, Sep.

Poisoning attack, which is one of the most recognized security threats towards machine learning- based IDSs, injects some adversarial samples into the training phase, inducing data drifting of training data and a significant performance decrease of target IDSs over testing data. In this paper, we adopt the Edge Pattern Detection (EPD) algorithm to design a novel poisoning method that attack against several machine learning algorithms used in IDSs. Specifically, we propose a boundary pattern detection algorithm to efficiently generate the points that are near to abnormal data but considered to be normal ones by current classifiers. Then, we introduce a Batch-EPD Boundary Pattern (BEBP) detection algorithm to overcome the limitation of the number of edge pattern points generated by EPD and to obtain more useful adversarial samples. Based on BEBP, we further present a moderate but effective poisoning method called chronic poisoning attack. Extensive experiments on synthetic and three real network data sets demonstrate the performance of the proposed poisoning method against several well-known machine learning algorithms and a practical intrusion detection method named FMIFS-LSSVM-IDS. © 2018 IEEE.","Chronic poisoning; Data drifting; Intrusion detection system; Machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Computer crime; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Network security; Pattern recognition; Signal detection; Boundary patterns; Data drifting; Detection algorithm; Intrusion detection method; Intrusion Detection Systems; Poisoning attacks; Real network datum; Security threats; Learning algorithms","Ambusaidi, M.A., He, X., Nanda, P., Tan, Z., Building an intrusion detection system using a filter-based feature selection algorithm (2016) IEEE Trans.

Unfortunately, recent research found that deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples in the image classification domain, i.e., they leave some opportunities for an attacker to fool the networks into misclassification by introducing imperceptible changes to the original pixels in an image. The vulnerability raises some concerns in applying deep neural networks in security-critical areas, such as intrusion detection. In this paper, we investigate the performances of the state-of-the-art attack algorithms against deep learning-based intrusion detection on the NSL-KDD data set. The vulnerabilities of neural networks employed by the intrusion detection systems are experimentally validated. The roles of individual features in generating adversarial examples are explored. Based on our findings, the feasibility and applicability of the attack methodologies are discussed. © 2013 IEEE.","classification algorithms; data security; Intrusion detection; neural networks","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Deep neural networks; Feature extraction; Job analysis; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Measurement; Network security; Neural networks; Perturbation techniques; Security of data; Classification algorithm; Individual features; Misclassifications; Perturbation method; Recent researches; Security-critical; State of the art; Task analysis; Intrusion detection","Shone, N., Ngoc, T.N., Phai, V.D., Shi, Q., A deep learning approach to network intrusion detection (2018) IEEE Trans.

These methods are being integrated in cyber detection systems with the goal of supporting or even replacing the first level of security analysts. Although the complete automation of detection and analysis is an enticing goal, the efficacy of machine learning in cyber security must be evaluated with the due diligence. We present an analysis, addressed to security specialists, of machine learning techniques applied to the detection of intrusion, malware, and spam. The goal is twofold: to assess the current maturity of these solutions and to identify their main limitations that prevent an immediate adoption of machine learning cyber detection schemes.

Example applications include classification for detecting spam, network intrusion detection, and credit card scoring. In fact, as the use of machine learning grows in diverse application domains, the possibility for adversarial behavior is likely to increase. When adversarial learning is modelled in a game-theoretic setup, the standard assumption about the adversary (player) behavior is the ability to change all features of the classifiers (the opponent player) at will. The adversary pays a cost proportional to the size of the 'attack'. We refer to this form of adversarial behavior as a dense feature attack. However, the aim of an adversary is not just to subvert a classifier but carry out data transformation in a way such that spam continues to remain effective. We demonstrate that an adversary could potentially achieve this objective by carrying out a sparse feature attack. We design an algorithm to show how a classifier should be designed to be robust against sparse adversarial attacks. Our main insight is that sparse feature attacks are best defended by designing classifiers which use ℓ1 regularizers. © 2018 IEEE.","Adversarial learning; nash equilibrium; sparse modeling; stackelberg game; ℓ1 regularizer","Artificial intelligence; Data structures; Electronic mail; Gallium compounds; Gallium nitride; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Mathematical transformations; Robustness (control systems); Adversarial learning; Games; Nash equilibria; Regularizer; Stackelberg Games; Game theory","Wang, F., Liu, W., Chawla, S., On sparse feature attacks in adversarial learning (2014) Proc.

However, the usage of adversarial examples, which are intentionally corrupted by noise, can lead to misclassification. As adversarial examples are serious threats to DNNs, both adversarial attacks and methods of defending against adversarial examples have been continuously studied. Zero-day adversarial examples are created with new test data and are unknown to the classifier; hence, they represent a more significant threat to DNNs. To the best of our knowledge, there are no analytical studies in the literature of zero-day adversarial examples with a focus on attack and defense methods through experiments using several scenarios. Therefore, in this study, zero-day adversarial examples are practically analyzed with an emphasis on attack and defense methods through experiments using various scenarios composed of a fixed target model and an adaptive target model. The Carlini method was used for a state-of-the-art attack, while an adversarial training method was used as a typical defense method. We used the MNIST dataset and analyzed success rates of zero-day adversarial examples, average distortions, and recognition of original samples through several scenarios of fixed and adaptive target models. Experimental results demonstrate that changing the parameters of the target model in real time leads to resistance to adversarial examples in both the fixed and adaptive target models. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Adversarial example; Adversarial training; Deep neural network (DNN); Zero-day adversarial examples","Image recognition; Intrusion detection; Network security; Speech recognition; Adversarial example; Analytical studies; Attack analysis; Misclassifications; Original sample; State of the art; Training methods; Zero days; Deep neural networks","Szegedy, C., Zaremba, W., Sutskever, I., Bruna, J., Erhan, D., Goodfellow, I., Fergus, R., Intriguing properties of neural networks (2014) ICLR; Carlini, N., Wagner, D., Towards evaluating the robustness of neural networks (2017) Security and Privacy (SP), 2017 IEEE Symposium on, pp. 39-57. , IEEE; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Jha, S., Fredrikson, M., Berkay Celik, Z., Swami, A., The limitations of deep learning in adversarial settings (2016) Security and Privacy (EuroS&P), 2016 IEEE European Symposium on, pp. 372-387. , IEEE; Goodfellow, I.J., Shlens, J., Szegedy, C., Explaining and harnessing adversarial examples (2015) ICLR; Shen, S., Jin, G., Gao, K., Zhang, Y., (2017) Ae-Gan: Adversarial Eliminating with Gan, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.05474; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Wu, X., Jha, S., Swami, A., Distillation as a defense to adversarial perturbations against deep neural networks (2016) Security and Privacy (SP), 2016 IEEE Symposium on, pp. 582-597. , IEEE",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450355766,,,"English","ASIACCS - Proc.

Adversary uses a variety of evasion techniques to avoid detection by traditional systems, which increase the diversity of malicious applications. Thus, there is a need for an intelligent system that copes with this issue. This paper proposes a machine learning (ML) based framework to counter rapid evolution of mobile threats. This model is based on flow-based features, that will work on the network side. This model is designed with adversarial input in mind. The model uses 40 time-based network flow features, extracted from the real-Time traffic of malicious and benign applications. The proposed model not only to detects the known and unknown mobile threats but also deals with the changing behavior of the attackers by triggering the retraining phase. The proposed framework can be used by the mobile operators to protect their subscribers. We used several supervised ML algorithms to build the model and got an average accuracy of up to 99.8. © 2018 IEEE.","Anomaly detection; Concept-drift; Intrusion Detection; Machine Learning; Mobile Threats","Intelligent systems; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Anomaly detection; Concept drifts; Mobile operators; Mobile Threats; Network-based framework; Real time traffics; Threat detection; Traditional systems; Malware","(2017) Mobile Phone Users Worldwide 2013-2019, , https://www.statista.com/statistics/274774/forecast-of-mobile-phone-users-worldwide, Statista Tech.

However, the computer security community is growing increasingly aware that a sophisticated adversary could target the learning module of these IDSs in order to circumvent future detections. Consequently, going forward, robustness of machine-learning based IDSs against adversarial manipulation (i.e., poisoning) will be the key factor for the overall success of these systems in the real world. In our work, we focus on adaptive IDSs that use anomaly-based detection to identify malicious activities in an information system. To be able to evaluate the susceptibility of these IDSs to deliberate adversarial poisoning, we have developed a novel framework for their performance testing under adversarial contamination. We have also studied the viability of using deep autoencoders in the detection of anomalies in adaptive IDSs, as well as their overall robustness against adversarial poisoning. Our experimental results show that our proposed autoencoder-based IDS outperforms a generic PCA-based counterpart by more than 15% in terms of detection accuracy. The obtained results concerning the detection ability of the deep autoencoder IDS under adversarial contamination, compared to that of the PCA-based IDS, are also encouraging, with the deep autoencoder IDS maintaining a more stable detection in parallel to limiting the contamination of its training dataset to just bellow 2%. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",,"Artificial intelligence; Contamination; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Pollution detection; Anomaly based detection; Detection ability; Detection accuracy; Intrusion Detection Systems; Malicious activities; Performance testing; Security community; Training dataset; Intrusion detection","Kantchelian, A., Afroz, S., Huang, L., Islam, A.C., Miller, B., Tschantz, M.C., Greenstadt, R., Tygar, J., Approaches to adversarial drift (2013) Proceedings of The 2013 ACM Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Security, pp. 99-110. , ACM; Huang, L., Joseph, A.D., Nelson, B., Rubinstein, B.I., Tygar, J., Adversarial machine learning (2011) Proceedings of The 4th ACM Workshop on Security and Artificial Intelligence, pp. 43-58. , ACM; Hodo, E., Bellekens, X., Hamilton, A., Tachtatzis, C., Atkinson, R., (2017) Shallow and Deep Networks Intrusion Detection System: A Taxonomy and Survey, , arXiv preprint; Ghorbani, A.A., Lu, W., Tavallaee, M., (2009) Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention: Concepts and Techniques, 47. , Springer Science & Business Media; Liao, H.J., Lin, C.H.R., Lin, Y.C., Tung, K.Y., Intrusion detection system: A comprehensive review (2013) Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 36 (1), pp. 16-24; Kim, G., Yi, H., Lee, J., Paek, Y., Yoon, S., (2016) Lstm-Based System-Call Language Modeling and Robust Ensemble Method for Designing Host-Based Intrusion Detection Systems, , arXiv preprint; Vasilomanolakis, E., Karuppayah, S., Mühlhäuser, M., Fischer, M., Taxonomy and survey of collaborative intrusion detection (2015) ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 47 (4), p. 55; Garcia-Teodoro, P., Diaz-Verdejo, J., Maciá-Fernández, G., Vázquez, E., Anomaly-based network intrusion detection: Techniques, systems and challenges (2009) Computers & Security, 28 (1), pp. 18-28; Buczak, A.L., Guven, E., A survey of data mining and machine learning methods for cyber security intrusion detection (2016) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 18 (2), pp. 1153-1176; Kandhari, R., Chandola, V., Banerjee, A., Kumar, V., Kandhari, R., Anomaly detection (2009) Comput.

Regardless of successful applications of machine learning algorithms in many scenarios, e.g., facial recognition, malware detection, automatic driving, and intrusion detection, these algorithms and corresponding training data are vulnerable to a variety of security threats, inducing a significant performance decrease. Hence, it is vital to call for further attention regarding security threats and corresponding defensive techniques of machine learning, which motivates a comprehensive survey in this paper. Until now, researchers from academia and industry have found out many security threats against a variety of learning algorithms, including naive Bayes, logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), principle component analysis, clustering, and prevailing deep neural networks. Thus, we revisit existing security threats and give a systematic survey on them from two aspects, the training phase and the testing/inferring phase. After that, we categorize current defensive techniques of machine learning into four groups: security assessment mechanisms, countermeasures in the training phase, those in the testing or inferring phase, data security, and privacy. Finally, we provide five notable trends in the research on security threats and defensive techniques of machine learning, which are worth doing in-depth studies in future. © 2013 IEEE.","adversarial samples; defensive techniques; Machine learning; security threats","Artificial intelligence; Automobile drivers; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Decision trees; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Face recognition; Image processing; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Malware; Natural language processing systems; Pattern recognition; Personnel training; Principal component analysis; Security systems; Support vector machines; Surveys; Taxonomies; Testing; Data security and privacy; defensive techniques; Logistic regressions; Principle component analysis; Security; Security assessment; Security threats; Training data; Learning algorithms","Zhou, L., Pan, S., Wang, J., Vasilakos, A.V., Machine learning on big data: Opportunities and challenges (2017) Neurocomputing, 237, pp. 350-361. , May; Yu, S., Big privacy: Challenges and opportunities of privacy study in the age of big data (2016) IEEE Access, 4, pp. 2751-2763; Al-Jarrah, O.Y., Yoo, P.D., Muhaidat, S., Karagiannidis, G.K., Taha, K., Efficient machine learning for big data: A review (2015) Big Data Res., 2 (3), pp. 87-93; Chen, X.-W., Lin, X., Big data deep learning: Challenges and perspectives (2014) IEEE Access, 2, pp. 514-525; L'Heureux, A., Grolinger, K., Elyamany, H.F., Capretz, M.A.M., Machine learning with big data: Challenges and approaches (2017) IEEE Access, 5, pp. 7776-7797; Wittel, G.L., Wu, S.F., On attacking statistical spam filters (2004) Proc. 1st Conf.

Not with standing the computational limitations of individual robots, such systems rely on collaboration to sense and react to the environment. This paper formulates the generic target tracking problem as a time-varying optimization problem and puts forth an inexact online gradient descent method for solving it sequentially. The performance of the proposed algorithm is studied by characterizing its dynamic regret, a notion common to the online learning literature. Building upon the existing results, we provide improved regret rates that not only allow nonstrongly convex costs but also explain the role of the cumulative gradient error. Two distinct classes of problems are considered: one in which the objective function adheres to a quadratic growth condition, and another where the objective function is convex but the variable belongs to a compact domain. For both cases, results are developed while allowing the error to be either adversarial or arising from a white noise process. Further, the generality of the proposed framework is demonstrated by developing online variants of existing stochastic gradient algorithms and interpreting them as special cases of the proposed inexact gradient method. The efficacy of the proposed inexact gradient framework is established on a multiagent multitarget tracking problem, while its flexibility is exemplified by generating online movie recommendations for Movielens 10M dataset. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","gradient descent methods; stochastic optimization; target tracking; Time varying optimization","Clutter (information theory); Functions; Gradient methods; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Intrusion detection; Multi agent systems; Random processes; Signal processing; Stochastic systems; Target tracking; White noise; Convex functions; Gradient Descent method; Signal processing algorithms; Stochastic optimizations; Time varying; Optimization","Dubowsky, S., Iagnemma, K., Liberatore, S., Lambeth, D., Plante, J., Boston, P., A concept mission: Microbots for large-scale planetary surface and subsurface exploration (2005) AIP Conf.

In order to keep good classification performance, many robuster learning methods have been proposed to deal with the adversarial attack. Support Vector Machines(SVMs) is a kind of successful approach in the adversarial classification tasks and the investigation of robust SVMs is very popular. However, in many real application, the data including stain instance is coming dynamically. Batch learning which needs retraining when encountering new samples, will consume more computing resources. In this paper, we propose a robust Lagrangian support vector machine (RLSVM) with modified kernel matrix and explore the online learning algorithm on it. The experimental results show the robustness of RLSVM against label noise produced by adversaries under the online adversarial environment. © 2018 The Authors.

A number of botnet detection measures, such as honeynet-based and Intrusion Detection System (IDS)-based, have been proposed. However, IDS-based solutions that use signatures seem to be ineffective because recent botnets are equipped with sophisticated code update and evasion techniques. A number of studies have shown that abnormal botnet detection methods are more effective than signature-based methods because anomaly-based botnet detection methods do not require pre-built botnet signatures and hence they have the capability to detect new or unknown botnets. In this direction, this paper proposes a botnet detection model based on machine learning using Domain Name Service query data and evaluates its effectiveness using popular machine learning techniques. Experimental results show that machine learning algorithms can be used effectively in botnet detection and the random forest algorithm produces the best overall detection accuracy of over 90%. © 2019 by the authors.","Botnet detection; Botnet detection model; Domain generation algorithm botnet detection; Fast flux botnet detection; Machine learning-based botnet detection","Botnet; Decision trees; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Network security; Botnet detections; Detection accuracy; Domain name service; Intrusion Detection Systems; Machine learning techniques; On-machines; Query datum; Random forest algorithm; Learning algorithms","(2016) The 2016 Vietnam Information Security Report, , Authority of Information Security, MIC: New York, NY, USA; Ferguson, R., The History of the Botnet, , http://countermeasures.trendmicro.eu/thehistory-of-the-botnet-part-i/, (accessed on 1 February 2018); Alieyan, K., Almomani, A., Manasrah, A., Kadhum, M.M., A survey of botnet detection based on DNS (2017) Nat.

However, adversaries too are becoming more effective in concealing malicious behavior amongst large amounts of benign behavior data. To address the increasing time-to-detection of these stealthy attacks, interconnected and federated learning systems can improve the detection of malicious behavior by joining forces and pooling together monitoring data. The major challenge that we address in this work is that in a federated learning setup, an adversary has many more opportunities to poison one of the local machine learning models with malicious training samples, thereby influencing the outcome of the federated learning and evading detection. We present a solution where contributing parties in federated learning can be held accountable and have their model updates audited. We describe a permissioned blockchain-based federated learning method where incremental updates to an anomaly detection machine learning model are chained together on the distributed ledger. By integrating federated learning with blockchain technology, our solution supports the auditing of machine learning models without the necessity to centralize the training data. Experiments with a realistic intrusion detection use case and an autoencoder for anomaly detection illustrate that the increased complexity caused by blockchain technology has a limited performance impact on the federated learning, varying between 5 and 15%, while providing full transparency over the distributed training process of the neural network. Furthermore, our blockchain-based federated learning solution can be generalized and applied to more sophisticated neural network architectures and other use cases. © 2018 by the authors.","Anomaly detection; Audit; Blockchain; Federated deep learning; Performance",,"Sadeghi, A.R., Wachsmann, C., Waidner, M., Security and Privacy Challenges in Industrial Internet of Things (2015) Proceedings of the 2015 52nd ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC), pp. 54:1-54:6. , San Francisco, CA, USA, 8-12 June 2015; ACM: New York, NY, USA; Preuveneers, D., Zudor, E.I., The intelligent industry of the future: A survey on emerging trends, research challenges and opportunities in Industry 4.0 (2017) JAISE, 9, pp. 287-298; Verma, R.M., Kantarcioglu, M., Marchette, D.J., Leiss, E.L., Solorio, T., Security Analytics: Essential Data Analytics Knowledge for Cybersecurity Professionals and Students (2015) IEEE Secur.

The smart devices promise to improve human life through improved safety and security through the implementation of intelligent transportation systems, optimization of power grids, and applications in human health. Devices produce a large amount of data for analytic applications running inside a cloud infrastructure. Unlike core networks, the main objective of an attack on an IoT network is to disrupt the availability of IoT data for the applications by overwhelming devices with information requests. Detection of such an attack cannot be done either in the cloud where the analytical application runs nor on the IoT device itself due to its limited computational resources. Furthermore, the standard networking paradigm does not provide an easy way to instrument and control networking nodes, for an effective mitigation of identified threats. In this paper, we propose a fog-assisted software defined networking (SDN) driven intrusion detection/prevention system (IDPS) for IoT networks. A collocated fog computational arrangement with IoT network equips proposed IDPS for timely identification of various attack models in near real time for effective neutralization of threats using SDN control. We have found our approach more effective from traditional techniques of intrusion detection in the IoT network. © 2013 IEEE.","anomaly; fog; intrusion detection; IoT; machine learning; network security; SDN","Computer crime; Edge detection; Electric power transmission networks; Entropy; Feature extraction; Fog; Fog computing; Intelligent systems; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Network security; Analytical applications; Anomaly; Computational resources; Image edge detection; Intelligent transportation systems; Internet of Things (IOT); Intrusion detection/prevention systems; Software defined networking (SDN); Internet of things","Li, S., Xu, L., Zhao, S., The internet of Things: A survey (2015) Inf.

Conventional classifiers widely used in these applications are found vulnerable themselves to adversarial machine learning attacks. Existing studies argued that ensemble classifiers are more robust than a single classifier under evasion attacks due to more uniform weights produced on the basis of training data. In this paper, we investigate the problem in a more practical setting where attackers do not know the classifier details. Instead, attackers may acquire only a portion of the labeled data or a replacement dataset for learning the target decision boundary. In this case, we show that ensemble classifiers are not necessarily more robust under a least effort attack based on gradient descent. Our experiments are conducted with both linear and kernel SVMs on real datasets for spam filtering and malware detection. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adversarial machine learning; Ensemble classifiers; Evasion attacks","Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Information systems; Information use; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Malware; Pattern recognition systems; Systems engineering; Conventional classifier; Decision boundary; Ensemble classifiers; Evasion attacks; Gradient correlation; Gradient descent; Malware detection; Real data sets; Classification (of information)","Androutsopoulos, I., Paliouras, G., Michelakis, E., (2004) Learning to Filter Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail; Biggio, B., Evasion attacks against machine learning at test time ECML PKDD 2013.

The application of learning algorithm for detecting anomaly in a Network has been fundamental since few years. With increasing use of machine learning techniques it has become important to study to what extent it is good to be dependent on them. Altogether a different discipline called 'Adversarial Learning' have come up as a separate dimension of study. The work in this paper is to test the robustness of online machine learning based IDS to carefully crafted packets by attacker called poison packets. The objective is to observe how a remote attacker can deviate the normal behavior of machine learning based classifier in the IDS by injecting the network with carefully crafted packets externally, that may seem normal by the classification algorithm and the instance made part of its future training set. This behavior eventually can lead to a poison learning by the classification algorithm in the long run, resulting in misclassification of true attack instances. This work explores one such approach with SOM and SVM as the online learning based classification algorithms. © 2018-IOS Press and the authors.

However, success has been accompanied with important new challenges: many applications of machine learning are adversarial in nature. Some are adversarial because they are safety critical, such as autonomous driving. An adversary in these applications can be a malicious party aimed at causing congestion or accidents, or may even model unusual situations that expose vulnerabilities in the prediction engine. Other applications are adversarial because their task and/or the data they use are. For example, an important class of problems in security involves detection, such as malware, spam, and intrusion detection. The use of machine learning for detecting malicious entities creates an incentive among adversaries to evade detection by changing their behavior or the content of malicius objects they develop. The field of adversarial machine learning has emerged to study vulnerabilities of machine learning approaches in adversarial settings and to develop techniques to make learning robust to adversarial manipulation. This book provides a technical overview of this field. After reviewing machine learning concepts and approaches, as well as common use cases of these in adversarial settings, we present a general categorization of attacks on machine learning. We then address two major categories of attacks and associated defenses: decision-time attacks, in which an adversary changes the nature of instances seen by a learned model at the time of prediction in order to cause errors, and poisoning or training time attacks, in which the actual training dataset is maliciously modified. In our final chapter devoted to technical content, we discuss recent techniques for attacks on deep learning, as well as approaches for improving robustness of deep neural networks. We conclude with a discussion of several important issues in the area of adversarial learning that in our view warrant further research. Given the increasing interest in the area of adversarial machine learning, we hope this book provides readers with the tools necessary to successfully engage in research and practice of machine learning in adversarial settings.

However, many researchers argue that a variety of attacks are significantly challenging the security of machine learning techniques themselves. In this paper, we study two different types of security threats which can effectively degrade the performance of machine learning based wireless IDSs. First, we propose an Adaptive SMOTE (A-SMOTE) algorithm which can adaptively generate new training data points based on few existing ones with labels. Then, we introduce a stealing model attack by training a substitute model using deep neural networks (DNNs) based on the augmented training data in order to imitate the machine learning model embedded in targeted systems. After that, we present a novel poisoning strategy to attack against the substitute machine learning model, resulting in a set of adversarial samples that can be used to degrade the performance of targeted systems. Experiments on three real data sets collected from wired and wireless networks have demonstrated that the proposed stealing model and poisoning attacks can effectively degrade the performance of IDSs using different machine learning algorithms. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",,"Artificial intelligence; Deep neural networks; Embedded systems; Intrusion detection; Detection accuracy; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Malicious traffic; Poisoning attacks; Security threats; Wired and wireless; Wireless intrusion detections; Learning algorithms","Tsai, C.F., Hsu, Y.F., Lin, C.Y., Lin, W.Y., Intrusion detection by machine learning: A review (2009) Expert Syst.

In our work, we adopt poisoning attack to influence the accuracy of wireless IDSs that adopt feature selection algorithms. Specifically, we adopt the gradient poisoning method to generate adversarial examples which induce classifier to select a feature subset to make the classification error rate biggest. We consider the box-constrained problem and use Lagrange multiplier and backtracking line search to find the feasible gradient. To evaluate our method, we experimentally demonstrate that our attack method can influence machine learning, including filter and embedded feature selection algorithms using three benchmark network public datasets and a wireless sensor network dataset, i.e., KDD99, NSL-KDD, Kyoto 2006+ and WSN-DS. Our results manifest that gradient poisoning method causes a significant drop in the classification accuracy of IDSs about 20%. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Adversarial examples; Feature selection; Gradient poisoning; IDS","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Constraint theory; Intrusion detection; Lagrange multipliers; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Network security; Wireless sensor networks; Adversarial environments; Adversarial examples; Backtracking line search; Box constrained problems; Classification error rate; Embedded feature selections; Feature selection algorithm; Intrusion Detection Systems; Feature extraction","Grosse, K., Papernot, N., Manoharan, P., Backes, M., McDaniel, P., (2016) Adversarial perturbations against deep neural networks for malware classification; Xu, W., Qi, Y., Evans, D., Automatically evading classifiers (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 Network and Distributed Systems Symposium; Tibshirani, R., Regression shrinkage and selection via the lasso (1996) J.

However, in some situations, adversarial examples might be useful, i.e., for deceiving an enemy classifier on a battlefield. In that case, friendly classifiers should not be deceived. In this paper, we propose adversarial examples that are friend-safe, which means that friendly machines can classify the adversarial example correctly. To make such examples, the transformation is carried out to minimize the friend’s wrong classification and the adversary’s correct classification. We suggest two configurations of the scheme: targeted and untargeted class attacks. In experiments using the MNIST dataset, the proposed method shows a 100% attack success rate and 100% friendly accuracy with little distortion (2.18 and 1.53 for each configuration, respectively). Finally, we propose a mixed battlefield application and a new covert channel scheme. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Adversarial example; Covert channel; Deep neural network; Evasion attack","Chromium compounds; Cryptography; Image recognition; Intrusion detection; Adversarial example; Covert channels; Evasion attack; Mnist dataset; Pattern analysis; Deep neural networks","Schmidhuber, J., Deep learning in neural networks: An overview (2015) Neural Netw, 61, pp. 85-117; Simonyan, K., Zisserman, A., (2014) Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition; Hinton, G., Deep neural networks for acoustic modeling in speech recognition: The shared views of four research groups (2012) IEEE Sig.

Its peculiarity is to learn legitimate payloads by splitting packets into chunks and determining the within-packet distribution of n-grams. This strategy is resistant to evasion techniques as blending. We prove that finding the right legitimate content is NP-hard in the presence of chunks. Moreover, it improves the false-positive rate for a given detection rate with respect to the case where the spatial information is not considered. Comparison with well-known IDSs using n-grams highlights that PCkAD achieves state-of-the-art performances.","Anomaly detection; Intrusion detection systems; N-grams; Semisupervised learning","Blending; Computer crime; Mercury (metal); Anomaly detection; False positive rates; Intrusion Detection Systems; N-grams; Packet distribution; Semi- supervised learning; Spatial informations; State-of-the-art performance; Intrusion detection","Shawt Adams, E., (1992) A Study of Trigrams and Their Feasibility As Index Terms in A Full Text Information Retrieval System, , Ph.D. Dissertation.

However, while security researchers often utilize such techniques to address problems and AI/ML researchers develop techniques for Big Data analytics applications, neither community devotes much attention to the other. Within security research, AI/ML components are usually regarded as black-box solvers. Conversely, the learning community seldom considers the security/privacy implications entailed in the application of their algorithms when they are designing them. While these two communities generally focus on different directions, where these two fields do meet, interesting problems appear. Researchers working in this intersection have raised many novel questions for both communities and created a new branch of research known as secure learning. The AISec workshop has become the primary venue for this unique fusion of research. In recent years, there has been an increase of activity within the AISec/secure learning community. There are several reasons for this surge. Firstly, machine learning, data mining, and other artificial intelligence technologies play a key role in extracting knowledge, situational awareness, and security intelligence from Big Data. Secondly, industry is increasingly exploring and deploying learning technologies to address Big Data problems for their customers. Finally, these trends are increasingly exposing companies and their customers/users to intelligent technologies. As a result, these learning technologies are being explored by researchers both as potential solutions to security/privacy problems and also as a potential source of new vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. The AISec Workshop meets this need and serves as the sole long-running venue for this topic. AISec, having been annually co-located with CCS for ten consecutive years, is the premier meeting place for researchers interested in the junction of security, privacy, AI, and machine learning. Its role as a venue has been to merge practical security problems with advances in AI and machine learning. In doing so, researchers also have been developing theory and analytics unique to this domain and have explored diverse topics such as learning in game-theoretic adversarial environments, privacy-preserving learning, and applications to spam and intrusion detection. © 2017 author(s).","Adversarial Learning; Malware Detection; Secure Learning","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Data privacy; Decision making; Game theory; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Adversarial environments; Adversarial learning; Artificial intelligence technologies; Intelligent technology; International workshops; Malware detection; Secure Learning; Situational awareness; Data mining",,,,"Association for Computing Machinery",15437221,9781450349468,,,"English","Proc ACM Conf Computer Commun Secur",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041434657

Such a usage gap occurs mainly due to the difficulty to maintain the detection rate in acceptable level, given the occurrence of false alarms. In general, the literature does not consider the adversarial settings, when an opponent attempt to evade the detection system, thus possibly rendering the system unreliable over time. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a new approach to reliably perform real time stream learning for anomaly-based intrusion detection. We employ a class-specific stream outlier detector to automatically update the intrusion detection engine over the time, and a rejection mechanism, which makes it possible to obtain indications that an evasion attempt might being happening. Furthermore, the proposal is resilient to causative attacks, providing a secure intrusion detection mechanism even when the attacker can inject misclassified instances in the training dataset. The evaluation tests show that the proposed approach is resilient to exploratory attacks, allowing the system administrator to know when an evasion attempt might be occurring. © 2017 IEEE.","Adversarial Settings; Intrusion Detection; Outlier Detection; Stream Learning","Mercury (metal); Statistics; Anomaly-based intrusion detection; Detection system; Outlier Detection; Production environments; Real-time streams; Rejection mechanisms; Stream Learning; System administrators; Intrusion detection","García-Teodoro, P., Díaz-Verdejo, J., Maciá-Ferná Ndez, G., Vá Zquez, E., Anomaly-based network intrusion detection: Techniques, systems and challenges (2009) Comput.

Such opportunities can also represent an adversarial target, if his objective is to block the RF system from using such opportunities opened by spectrum holes. In this paper, we explore the challenge of finding spectrum holes in an adversarial environment. First, by means of a simple model, we show that an adversary's attack designed to close spectrum holes can be more harmful for the spectrum holes than just random jamming. This calls for designing a scanning strategy to detect such an attack. Second, by applying a game-theoretical model, we design the optimal scanning strategy to detect such attacks. In particular, we show the efficiency of such a scanning strategy compared with uninformed random scanning. This efficiency is achieved by focusing scanning efforts on the bands that will be more likely under attack, and neglecting less promising bands. Beyond the benefits, though, such a strategy has also drawbacks since, if the adversary has a different objective, such as sneaking usage of the spectrum, he can sneak usage undetected by using the bands neglected by such specially tuned scanning. To deal with this problem, third, we suggest to combine this strategy with a strategy that maximizes detection probability in a learning algorithm that updates the beliefs about the adversary's objective. The convergence of the combined algorithm is proven. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Bayes methods; Intrusion detection; wireless networks","Efficiency; Game theory; Intrusion detection; Wireless networks; Adversarial environments; Bayes method; Combined algorithms; Detection probabilities; Game theoretical models; Radio frequencies; Scanning strategies; Simple modeling; Scanning","Tandra, R., Mishra, S.M., Sahai, A., What is a spectrum hole and what does it take to recognize one (2009) Proc.

In machine learning process, the test set and the training set usually have the same probability distribution and through the information of learning the training set, the malicious samples in the machine learning algorithm can usually be correctly classified. However, the classification algorithm has neglected the classification under adversarial environment, so instead they will modify the features of test data in order to spoof the classifier so as to escape its detection. In this paper, we will consider to modify the feature value of the test samples in accordance with attack algorithm proposed by Battista Biggio and further improve the algorithm. As each feature has a range of independent constraints, so the algorithm should be transformed into a constrained optimization problem. This is done in order to make the original sample modify the smaller distance so as to escape the detection of the classifier, while also improve the convergence rate during the generation of adversarial samples. © 2017 IEEE.","adversarial machine learning; component; constrained optimization; evasion attacks","Constrained optimization; Intelligent systems; Intrusion detection; Knowledge engineering; Learning algorithms; Probability distributions; Adversarial environments; Classification algorithm; component; Constrained optimi-zation problems; Convergence rates; evasion attacks; Network intrusion detection; Optimization strategy; Machine learning","Dalvi, N., Domingos, P., Mausam, Adversarial classification (2004) Proceeding of the 2004 ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 99-108. , ACM Press; Lowd, D., Meek, C., Adversarial learning (2005) Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 641-647. , ACM Press; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Can machine learning be secure?

Due to the large amount of generated data over the network, its storage for further analysis may not be feasible. Moreover, current attacks are becoming more sophisticated, as the attackers are attempting to evade traditional intrusion detection mechanisms by perverting their properties. This paper presents a novel real-time (ongoing) network traffic measurement approach that supports resilient analysis for stream learning intrusion detection. The network data is grouped at runtime according to its characteristics, while each network traffic flow is discretized at regular time intervals. Each network flow is classified by a multi-view stream learning classifiers pool, defining the network flow class through a majority voting approach. The proposal is able to provide resiliency to the classifiers even for the detection of unknown attacks. The evaluation tests for the average operation point (25 views) provides an increase in the system resilience to adversarial attacks of 22 % when compared to traditional approaches. Moreover, in the scalability experiments with a 10-node (single core each) cluster testbed, the network flow measurement solution (1 view) reached 1.38 Gbps throughput, while the proposed resilient stream learning intrusion detection with 25 views reached a throughput of 1.19 Gbps. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Digital storage; Flow measurement; Learning classifiers; Network traffic flow; Network traffic measurement; Networked systems; Real time analysis; System resiliences; Traditional approaches; Voting approach; Intrusion detection","http://www.cisco.com, Cisco VNI Forecast and Methodology, 2015-2020/, [Accessed: September 2017]; Zuech, R., Khoshgoftaar, T.M., Wald, R., Intrusion detection and Big Heterogeneous Data: A Survey (2015) J.

The flexibility in services has opened doors for attackers. Research has been performed to detect various malware in the last few years. However, modern malware are advanced enough to detect the presence of virtualization environment, security analyzer, or even the hypervisor by observing the virtualization-specific information such as virtual processor features, timing features, etc. The malware exhibit evasive nature and can fool existing security solutions by performing modern antidetection tactics. In this paper, we propose an approach named as VMI-assisted evasion detection (VAED), deployed at virtual machine monitor, to detect the evasion-based malware attacks. The VAED is based on learning the program semantic of evasive malware. It uses system call dependency graph approach generated using Markov Chain principle and keeps track of system call ordering with transition probability distribution between each pair system calls. It uses software break point injection technique to extract the system call traces of evasive malware samples, which is free from any modification in hardware-specific values. Hence, it is secure from evasion attempts. The VAED is validated over evasive samples collected from the University of California on request, and results seem to be promising.

The challenge of intrusion detection is further complicated because, as advances are made in the ability to detect attacks, similar advances are made by adversaries to thwart those detective measures. Although numerous machine learning algorithms and approaches have proven effective in detecting cyberattacks, these algorithms have limitations, especially in dealing with adversarial environments. This study addresses the problem that there is not an effective machine learning algorithm that minimizes human interaction to train and evolve the learner to adapt to changing cyberattacks and evasive tactics. This research concludes that selective sampling of unlabeled data for classification by a human expert can result in more efficient labeling for large datasets and demonstrates a more resilient approach to machine learning that utilizes active learning to interact with human subject matter experts and that adapts to changing data, thus addressing issues related to data tampering and evasion. © 2017 IEEE.","Active learning; Adversarial evasion; Intrusion detection; K-means clustering; KDD-CUP 99; Machine learning; Random forest; Tampering","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Mercury (metal); Active Learning; Adversarial evasion; K-means clustering; KDD-CUP 99; Random forests; Tampering; Learning algorithms","Denning, D.E., Neumann, P.G., Requirements and model for IDES - A real-time intrusion detection expert system (1985) Document A005, SRI International, 333; Denning, D.E., An intrusion-detection model (1987) IEEE Trans. on Software Engineering, 2, pp. 222-232; Barbará, D., Couto, J., Jajodia, S., Popyack, L., Wu, N., ADAM: Detecting intrusions by data mining (2001) Proc.

In this paper, we combine classification with recent and scalable nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) methods. Classification and DR are not necessarily adversarial, provided adequate cluster magnification occurring in NLDR methods like t-SNE: DR mitigates the curse of dimensionality, while cluster magnification can maintain class separability. We demonstrate experimentally the effectiveness of the approach by analyzing and comparing results on the big KDD99 dataset, using both NLDR quality assessment and classification rate for SVMs and random forests. Since data involves features of mixed types (numerical and categorical), the use of Gower's similarity coefficient as metric further improves the results over the classical similarity metric. © ESANN 2017 - Proceedings, 25th European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning.

The continuous change in the way attacks are appearing, the volume of attacks, as well as the improvements in the big data analytics space, make machine learning approaches more alluringthan ever. The intention of this paper is to show that using machine learning in the intrusion detection domain should be accompanied with an evaluation of its robustness against adversaries. Several adversarial techniques have emerged lately from the deep learning research, largely in the area of image classification. These techniques are based on the idea of introducing small changes in the original input data in order to make a machine learning model to misclassify it. This paper follows a big data analytics methodology and explores adversarial machine learning techniques that have emerged from the deep learning domain, against machine learning classifiers used for network intrusion detection. We look at several well-known classifiers and study their performance under attack over several metrics, such as accuracy, F1-score and receiver operating characteristic. The approach used assumes no knowledge of the original classifier and examines both general and targeted misclassification. The results showthat using relatively simple methods for generating adversarial samples it is possible to lower the detection accuracy of intrusion detection classifiers as much as 27%. Performance degradation is achieved using a methodology that is simpler than previous approaches and it requires only 6.14% change between the original and the adversarial sample, making it a candidate for a practical adversarial approach. © 2017 CEUR-WS.

All model classes of machine learning systems can be misled by providing carefully crafted inputs making them wrongly classify inputs. Maliciously created input samples can affect the learning process of a ML system by either slowing the learning process, or affecting the performance of the learned model or causing the system make error only in attacker’s planned scenario. Because of these developments, understanding security of machine learning algorithms and systems is emerging as an important research area among computer security and machine learning researchers and practitioners.

Accurate detection of stealthy Peer-to-Peer botnets is an ongoing research problem. Past research on detection of P2P botnets has frequently used machine learning algorithms to build detection models. However, most prior work lacks the evaluation of such detection models in the presence of deliberate injection of noise by an adversary. Furthermore, detection of P2P botnets in the presence of benign P2P traffic has received little attention from the research community. This work proposes a novel approach for the detection of stealthy P2P botnets (in presence of benign P2P traffic) using conversation-based mechanisms and new features based on Fourier transforms and information entropy. We use real-world botnet data to compare the performance of our features with traditional ‘flow-based’ features employed by past research, and demonstrate that our approach is more resilient towards the injection of noise in the communication patterns by an adversary. We build detection models with multiple supervised machine learning algorithms. With our approach, we could detect P2P botnet traffic in the presence of injected noise with True Positive rate as high as 90%. © 2016","Botnet; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Peer-to-peer; Security","Artificial intelligence; Distributed computer systems; Fourier transforms; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Malware; Supervised learning; Botnet; Communication pattern; Information entropy; Peer to peer; Research communities; Security; Supervised machine learning; True positive rates; Learning algorithms","Andriesse, D., Rossow, C., Stone-Gross, B., Plohmann, D., Bos, H., Highly resilient peer-to-peer botnets are here: an analysis of Gameover Zeus (2013) Malicious and Unwanted Software:“ The Americas” (MALWARE), 2013 8th International Conference on, pp. 116-123. , IEEE; Bouckaert, R.R., Bayesian network classifiers in WEKA for version 3-5-7 (2008) Artif.

Primary reason for this is our perception that Linux is a secure system. Malwares are used very often to penetrate into any computer or network; malware authors are using various obfuscation techniques to impede the detection from traditional signature based Anti-virus system. Automated dynamic malware analysis systems are one of the latest weapons used by security researchers to counter them. To counter dynamic analysis, malware authors are using various evasion techniques. Challenge now lies in finding a generic and efficient technique which can detectpotentially malicious file. This article is a survey of dynamic analysis techniques proposed or implemented in the context of Linux systems. The survey classifies these approaches into five types: System-call base approach, Process Control Block based approach, ELF based approach, Linux kernel based approach and Hybrid approach. It also discusses open problems not handled by these techniques. Providing current bibliography, it may aid Linux malware researchers to identify suitable analysis technique and the way forward. © 2016 IEEE.","Dynamic Analysis; Linux Malware; Machine Learning; Malware Analysis; Process Control Block; System calls","Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Computer operating systems; Computer viruses; Dynamic analysis; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Linux; Process control; Surveys; Analysis techniques; Anti-virus systems; Dynamic analysis techniques; Dynamic malware analysis; Hybrid approach; Linux environment; Malware analysis; System calls; Malware","Virus Total File Statistics, , https://www.virustotal.com/en/statistics/, (Last Accessed on 29 luly, 2015); ESET Report on Operation Windigo, , http://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/operation_windigo.pdf, (Last accessed on 7 Sep, 2015); http://blog.malwaremustdie.org/2015/01/mmd-0030-2015-new-elf-malware-on.html, MalwareMustDie Blog, Shellshock: The ChinaZ, Detected on 13 Jan, 2015 (Last accessed onlO Sep, 2015); http://linux.die.net/man/l/strace, strace (l)-Linux man (strace (l): Trace system calls/ signals) (Last Accessed on 4 Nov, 2015); Forrest, S., Hofmeyr, S.A., Somayaji, A., Longsta, T.A., A sense of selffor unix processes (1996) Proceedings OflEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 120-128. , CA; Lee, W., Stolfo, S.J., Data mining approaches to intrusion detection (1998) Proceedings of 7th USENIX Security Symposium, , San Antonio; Wang, X., Yu, W., Champion, A., Fu, X., Xuan, D., Detecting worms via mining dynamic program execution (2007) Proceedings of Third International Conference on Security and Privacy in Communication Networks and the Workshops, SecureComm, pp. 412-421. , Nice; Mehdi, B., Tiwanti, A.K., Farooq, M., IMAD: In-execution malware analysis and detection (2009) Proceedings of the Generic and Evolutionary Conference, pp. 1553-1560; Mehdi, B., Ahmed, F., Khayyam, S.A., Farooq, M., Towards a theory of generalizing system call representation for in-execution malware detection (2010) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Communication, pp. 1553-1560; Asmitha, K.A., Vinod, P., Linux malware detection using extended-symmetric uncertainty (2014) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4th International Conference, SPACE 2014, pp. 319-332. , Pune, India, October 18-22; Glass, G., (2006) Linux for Programmers and Users, p. 552. , Upper Saddle River, First Edition, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall; Shahzad, F., Bhatti, S., Shahzad, M., Farooq, M., Execution malware detection using task structures of linux process (2011) IEEE International Conference on Communication, pp. 1-6; Shahzad, F., Shahzad, M., Farooq, M., In-execution dynamic malware analysis and detection by mining information in process control blocks of Linux OS (2013) Information Science Journal, 231, pp. 45-63; Executable Linkable Format, , http://flint.cs.yale.edu/cs422/doc/ELF_Format.pdf, (LastAccessed lOAug, 2015); Shahzad, F., Farooq, M., Elf-miner: Using structural knowledge and data mining methods to detect new (linux) malicious executables (2011) Knowledge and Information Systems, pp. 1-24; The /Proc File System, , https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt, (LastAccessed 8 Oct, 2015); Kim, H., Choi, M., Linux kernel-based feature selection for android malware detection (2014) Asia-Pacific Network Operation and Management Symposium (APNOMS); Kehe, W., Yueguang, G., Wei, C., Tong, Z., The research and implementation of the linux process real-time monitoring technology (2012) Fourth International Conference on Computational and Information Sciences (ICCIS), pp. 1046-1049. , 17-19Aug; Shahzad, F., Saleem, M., Farooq, M., (2012) A Hybrid Framework for Malware Detection on Smartphones Using ELF Structural & PCB Runtime Traces, , Tech.

Hence, data mining techniques are becoming an essential tool for real-world cyber security applications. For example, a report from Gartner [4] claims that ""Information security is becoming a big data analytics problem, where massive amounts of data will be correlated, analyzed and mined for meaningful patterns"". Of course, data mining/analytics is a means to an end where the ultimate goal is to provide cyber security analysts with prioritized actionable insights derived from big data. This raises the question, can we directly apply existing techniques to cyber security applications? One of the most important differences between data mining for cyber security and many other data mining applications is the existence of malicious adversaries that continuously adapt their behavior to hide their actions and to make the data mining models ineffective. Unfortunately, traditional data mining techniques are insufficient to handle such adversarial problems directly. The adversaries adapt to the data miner's reactions, and data mining algorithms constructed based on a training dataset degrades quickly. To address these concerns, over the last couple of years new and novel data mining techniques which is more resilient to such adversarial behavior are being developed in machine learning and data mining community. We believe that lessons learned as a part of this research direction would be beneficial for cyber security researchers who are increasingly applying machine learning and data mining techniques in practice. To give an overview of recent developments in adversarial data mining, in this three hour long tutorial, we introduce the foundations, the techniques, and the applications of adversarial data mining to cyber security applications. We first introduce various approaches proposed in the past to defend against active adversaries, such as a minimax approach to minimize the worst case error through a zero-sum game. We then discuss a game theoretic framework to model the sequential actions of the adversary and the data miner, while both parties try to maximize their utilities. We also introduce a modified support vector machine method and a relevance vector machine method to defend against active adversaries. Intrusion detection and malware detection are two important application areas for adversarial data mining models that will be discussed in details during the tutorial. Finally, we discuss some practical guidelines on how to use adversarial data mining ideas in generic cyber security applications and how to leverage existing big data management tools for building data mining algorithms for cyber security. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Adversarial data mining; Big data analytics for cyber security","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Game theory; Information management; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Malware; Miners; Security of data; Teaching; Cyber security; Data management tools; Data mining algorithm; Data mining applications; Data mining community; Malicious adversaries; Practical guidelines; Relevance Vector Machine; Data mining","Cesa-Bianchi, N., Lugosi, G., (2006) Prediction, Learning, and Games, , Cambridge University Press; Dalvi, N.N., Domingos, P.M., Mausam, S.K.S., Verma, D., Adversarial classification (2004) 10th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 99-108. , Seattle, Washington, USA, August 22-25, 2004; Kantarcioglu, M., Xi, B., Clifton, C., Classifier evaluation and attribute selection against active adversaries (2011) Data Min.

Detecting anomalous behavior at the architectural level can help better explain the intent of the threat and strengthen overall system security posture. To that end, we present a framework that mines software component interactions from system execution history and applies a detection algorithm to identify anomalous behavior. The framework uses unsupervised learning at runtime, can perform fast anomaly detection «on the fly», and can quickly adapt to system load fluctuations and user behavior shifts. Our evaluation of the approach against a real Emergency Deployment System has demonstrated very promising results, showing the framework can effectively detect covert attacks, including insider threats, that may be easily missed by traditional intrusion detection methods. © 2016 IEEE.","Data Mining; Security; Software Architecture","Behavioral research; Data mining; Network architecture; Signal detection; Software architecture; Anomalous behavior; Anomaly detection; Architectural levels; Detection algorithm; Intrusion detection method; Security; Security mechanism; Software component; Intrusion detection","Chess, D.M., Security in an autonomic computing environment (2003) IBM Systems Journal, 42 (1), pp. 107-118; Yuan, E., Esfahani, N., Malek, S., A systematic survey of selfprotecting software systems (2014) ACM TAAS, 8 (4). , Jan; Salem, M.B., A survey of insider attack detection research (2008) Insider Attack and Cyber Security., pp. 69-90. , Springer; Srikant, R., Agrawal, R., Mining sequential patterns: Generalizations and performance improvements (1996) Advances in Database Technology L EDBT ?96., 1057, pp. 1-17. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg, Mar; Malek, S., A style-Aware architectural middleware for resourceconstrained, distributed systems (2005) IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 31 (3), pp. 256-272. , Mar; Councill, B., Heineman, G.T., Definition of a software component and its elements (2001) Component-based Software Engineering; The MITRE Corporation CWE-89: ?SQL Injection, , http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html; Owasp Top Ten Project, , https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category, OWASP.org OWASP Top Ten Project; Elia, I., Comparing SQL injection detection tools using attack injection: An experimental study (2010) ISSRE, pp. 289-298; The NTP Public Services Project the NTP FAQ, , http://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/NTP-s-Algo.htm; Yuan, E., Malek, S., Architecture-based self-protecting software systems (2013) QoSA ?13, pp. 33-42. , New York, NY, USA ACM; Hall, M., The weka data mining software: An update (2009) SIGKDD Explor.

Due to cutting-edge communication technology and advancements in terms of radio-mounted devices, groups in front-end war field, as well as rescue troops, are well connected to carry out their missions using multicast communication. The key to the success of military networks in a hostile environment is security and collaboration. Internal attacks are major threats to impose a great failure in their mission goal. We introduce a novel indirect internal stealthy attack and known direct internal stealthy attacks such as black hole and deny-to-forward attacks on tree-based multicast routing protocol. These internal attacks can induce the performance degradation in the multicast group. We design a distributed cross-layer based machine learning anomaly detection system for multicast communication of MANET. Using efficient multilayer features, rather than routing layer features alone, improve the accuracy of the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in terms of detection of direct and indirect internal stealthy attacks. We evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and detection accuracy of well-known multiclass classifiers in combination with various feature subset selection algorithms. Since our problem with classification is a multiclass, the performance metrics calculated here are different from the binary classifiers. Our IDS is efficient, with respect to high true positives, very low false positives and less resource consumption even in the very challenging conditions of multicast communication of ad hoc networks. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cross-layer; Feature subset selection algorithm; IDS; Internal stealthy attack; MANET; Military networks; More; Multicast communication; Multiclass classifier","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computer crime; Feature extraction; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Mercury (metal); Mobile security; Multicasting; Network routing; Telecommunication networks; Cross layer; Feature subset selection; IDS; Internal stealthy attack; MANET; Military networks; More; Multi-class classifier; Multicast communication; Mobile ad hoc networks","Buttyan, L., Hubaux, J.-P., (2007) Security and cooperation in wireless networks: Thwarting malicious and selfish behavior in the age of ubiquitous computing, , Cambridge University Press, New York; Yang, H., Provably secure three-party authenticated key agreement protocol using smart cards (2014) Computer Networks, 58, pp. 29-38; Zhou, J., 4S: A secure and privacy-preserving key management scheme for cloud-assisted wireless body area network in m-healthcare social networks (2015) Information Sciences, 314, pp. 255-276; http://www.defensesystems.com/articles/2012/02/08/cover-story-military-communications-technologies.aspx, The future of military communication on the battlefield.

While previous work has been mainly focused on devising adversary-aware classification algorithms to counter evasion attempts, only few authors have considered the impact of using reduced feature sets on classifier security against the same attacks. An interesting, preliminary result is that classifier security to evasion may be even worsened by the application of feature selection. In this paper, we provide a more detailed investigation of this aspect, shedding some light on the security properties of feature selection against evasion attacks. Inspired by previous work on adversary-aware classifiers, we propose a novel adversary-aware feature selection model that can improve classifier security against evasion attacks, by incorporating specific assumptions on the adversary's data manipulation strategy. We focus on an efficient, wrapper-based implementation of our approach, and experimentally validate its soundness on different application examples, including spam and malware detection. © 2015 IEEE.","Adversarial learning; classifier security; evasion attacks; feature selection; malware detection; spam filtering","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computer crime; Internet; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Malware; Mobile security; Pattern recognition; Application examples; Classification algorithm; Data manipulations; Feature sets; Machine learning techniques; Malware detection; Security properties; Test time; Feature extraction","Biggio, B., Akhtar, Z., Fumera, G., Marcialis, G.L., Roli, F., Security evaluation of biometric authentication systems under real spoofing attacks (2012) IET Biometrics, 1 (1), pp. 11-24; Rodrigues, R.N., Ling, L.L., Govindaraju, V., Robustness of multimodal biometric fusion methods against spoof attacks (2009) J.

Great success has been achieved by applying machine learning and data mining to the security settings for large dataset, such as in intrusion detection, virus detection, biometric identity recognition, and spam filtering. However, the strengths of the learning systems, such as the adaptability and ability to infer patterns, can also become their vulnerabilities when there are adversarial manipulations during the learning and predicting process. Considering the fact that the traditional learning strategies could potentially introduce security faults into the learning systems, robust machine learning techniques against the sophisticated adversaries need to be studied, which is referred to as secure learning and mining through this abstract. Based on the goal of secure learning and mining, I aim to analyze the behavior of learning systems in adversarial environments by studying different kinds of attacks against the learning systems. Then design robust learning algorithms to counter the corresponding malicious behaviors based on the evaluation and prediction of the adversaries' goal and capabilities.

They are classified into different forms based on the nature of their functionality such as Host based IDS, Network based IDS and Anomaly based IDS. However, Literature survey portrays different evasion techniques of IDS. Thus it is always important to study the responsive behavior of IDS after such failures. The state of the art shows that much work have been done on IDS on contrary to little on Intrusion Response System (IRS). In this paper we propose a model of IRS based on the inspiration derived from the functioning of defense and response mechanism in plants such Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR). The proposed model is the first attempt of its kind with the objective to develop an efficient response mechanism in a network subsequent to the failure of IDS, adopting plants as a source of inspiration. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Anomaly detection; Bio-inspired; Biologically inspired; Bot; Bot nets; Host intrusion system; Intrusion detection system; Intrusion response system; KDD99; Learning; Nature; Network security; Plants defense; SAR","Computer crime; Mercury (metal); Network security; Anomaly detection; Bio-inspired; Biologically inspired; Bot; Bot nets; Host intrusion system; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion response system; KDD99; Learning; Nature; Plants defense; SAR; Intrusion detection","Ma, W., Tran, D., Sharma, D., Negative selection with antigen feedback in intrusion detection (2008) Artificial Immune Systems, pp. 200-209. , Springer; Shameli-Sendi, A., Cheriet, M., Hamou-Lhadj, A., Taxonomy of intrusion risk assessment and response system (2014) Comput.

With the resent boom of mobile devices (e.g., Tablet computers, smart phones, smart devices, and wearable computing), the number of network users is bound to increase exponentially. But, most of the communications protocols, that span over the 7 layers of the OSI model, were designed in the late 1980's or 90's. Although most of these protocols have had subsequent updates over time, most of these protocols still remain largely unsecure and open to attacks. Hence it is critically important to secure these protocols across the 7 layers of the OSI model. As a part of my PhD research, I am working on a cross layer anomaly behavior detection system for various protocols. This system will be comprised of intrusion detection systems (IDS) for each of the protocols that are present in each layer. The behavior analysis of each protocol will be carried out in two phases. In the first phase (training), the features that accurately characterize the normal operations of the protocol are identified using data mining and statistical techniques and then use them to build a runtime model of protocol normal operations. In addition, some known attacks against the studied protocol are also studied to develop a partial attack model for the protocol. The anomaly behavior analysis modules of each layer are then fused to generate a highly accurate detection system with low false alarms. In the second phase, the cross-layer anomaly based IDS is used to detect attacks against any communication protocols. We have already developed anomaly behavior modules for TCP, UDP, IP, DNS and Wi-Fi protocols. Our experimental results show that our approach can detect attacks accurately and with very low false alarms. © 2015 IEEE.","Cross layer anomaly based intrusion detection system; data mining; DNS; machine learning; Wi-Fi","Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Computer networks; Cybernetics; Data mining; Errors; Internet protocols; Learning systems; Mercury (metal); Mobile devices; Network layers; OSI model; Smartphones; Transmission control protocol; Wi-Fi; Anomaly based intrusion detection systems; Behavior detection; Communications protocols; Exponential growth; Intrusion Detection Systems; Normal operations; Statistical techniques; Wearable computing; Intrusion detection","Al-Nashif, Y., (2008) Multi Level Anomaly Based Autonomic Intrusion Detection System, , PhD.

Existing program anomaly detection systems focusing on legal control flow attestation and short call sequence verification are inadequate to detect such stealthy attacks. In this paper, we point out the need to analyze program execution paths and discover event correlations in large-scale execution windows among millions of instructions. We propose an anomaly detection approach with two-stage machine learning algorithms to recognize diverse normal call-correlation patterns and detect program attacks at both inter-and intra-cluster levels. We implement a prototype of our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness against three real-world attacks and four synthetic anomalies with less than 0.01% false positive rates and 0.1~1.3 ms analysis overhead per behavior instance (1k to 50k function or system calls). © 2015 ACM.","Event correlation;

As machine learning techniques become more mainstream, they are being applied to a wider range of application domains. These algorithms are now trusted to make critical decisions in secure and adversarial environments such as healthcare, fraud detection, and network security, in which mistakes can be incredibly costly. They are also a critical component to most modern autonomous systems. However, the data driven approach utilized by these machine learning methods can prove to be a weakness if the data on which the models rely are corrupted by either nefarious or accidental means. Models that utilize on-line learning or periodic retraining to learn new patterns and account for data distribution changes are particularly susceptible to corruption through model drift. In modeling this type of scenario, specially crafted data points are added to the training set over time to adversely influence the system, inducing model drift which leads to incorrect classifications. Our work is focused on exploring the resistance of various machine learning algorithms to such an approach. In this paper we present an experimental framework designed to measure the susceptibility of anomaly detection algorithms to model drift.

Some works conducted over the last years have pointed out that such algorithms are generally susceptible to deception, notably in the form of attacks carefully constructed to evade detection. Various learning schemes have been proposed to overcome this weakness. One such system is Keyed IDS (KIDS), introduced at DIMVA '10. KIDS' core idea is akin to the functioning of some cryptographic primitives, namely to introduce a secret element (the key) into the scheme so that some operations are infeasible without knowing it. In KIDS the learned model and the computation of the anomaly score are both key-dependent, a fact which presumably prevents an attacker from creating evasion attacks. In this work we show that recovering the key is extremely simple provided that the attacker can interact with KIDS and get feedback about probing requests. We present realistic attacks for two different adversarial settings and show that recovering the key requires only a small amount of queries, which indicates that KIDS does not meet the claimed security properties. We finally revisit KIDS' central idea and provide heuristic arguments about its suitability and limitations. © 2015 IEEE.","Adversarial classification; anomaly detection; intrusion detection systems; secure machine learning","Distributed computer systems; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Adversarial classifications; Anomaly detection systems; Cryptographic primitives; Intrusion Detection Systems; Key recovery attacks; Learning schemes; On-machines; Security properties; Anomaly detection","Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure?

The literature on adversarial machine learning aims to develop learning algorithms which are robust to such adversarial evasion, but exhibits two significant limitations: a) failure to account for operational constraints and b) a restriction that decisions are deterministic. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a conceptual separation between learning, used to infer attacker preferences, and operational decisions, which account for adversarial evasion, enforce operational constraints, and naturally admit randomization. Our approach gives rise to an intractably large linear program. To overcome scalability limitations, we introduce a novel method for estimating a compact parity basis representation for the operational decision function. Additionally, we develop an iterative constraint generation approach which embeds adversary's best response calculation, to arrive at a scalable algorithm for computing near-optimal randomized operational decisions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

These intrusions (or attacks) are modeled as outliers (or noise) within a principled probabilistic framework. The proposed framework is based on finite Gaussian mixtures and allows the detection of both previously seen and unknown attacks against web services. The main idea of our framework is based on the consideration of malicious requests as outliers within our finite mixture model. Using this idea the intrusion detection problem is reduced to an adversarial classification problem. The merits of the proposed approach are shown using a data set containing both normal and intrusive requests, which were collected from a large real-life web service. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Intrusion detection; mixture model; outlier detection; unsupervised learning; Web service","Intrusion detection; Statistics; Systems engineering; Unsupervised learning; Web services; Adversarial classifications; Data set; Finite Gaussian mixtures; Finite mixture modeling; Mixture model; Outlier Detection; Probabilistic framework; Unknown attacks; Websites","Barnett, V., Lewis, T., (1994) Outliers in Statistical Data., , John Wiley & Sons; Bouguila, N., Ziou, D., Dirichlet-based probability model applied to human skin detection (2004) Proc. of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP)., pp. 521-524. , In; Bouguila, N., Ziou, D., A powerful finite mixture model based on the generalized Dirichlet distribution: Unsupervised learning and applications (2004) Proc. of the 17th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)., pp. 280-283. , In; Bouguila, N., Almakadmeh, K., Boutemedjet, S., A finite mixture model for simultaneous high-dimensional clustering, localized feature selection and outlier rejection (2012) Expert Systems with Applications, 39 (7), pp. 6641-6656; Bouguila, N., Ziou, D., Using unsupervised learning of a finite dirichlet mixture model to improve pattern recognition applications (2005) Pattern Recognition Letters, 26 (12), pp. 1916-1925; Bouguila, N., Ziou, D., Unsupervised selection of a finite dirichlet mixture model: An mml-based approach (2006) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 18 (8), pp. 993-1009; Chan, P.K., Lippmann, R., Machine learning for computer security (2006) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 6, pp. 2669-2672; Corona, I., Giacinto, G., Detection of server-side web attacks (2010) JMLR Proceedings, 11, pp. 160-166. , In: Diethe, T., Cristianini, N., Shawe-Taylor, J.

Under such adversarial environments, adversaries can generate exploratory attacks against the defender such as evasion and reverse engineering. In this paper, we discuss why reverse engineering attacks can be carried out quite efficiently against fixed classifiers, and investigate the use of randomization as a suitable strategy for mitigating their risk. In particular, we derive a semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation for learning a distribution of classifiers subject to the constraint that any single classifier picked at random from such distribution provides reliable predictions with a high probability. We analyze the tradeoff between variance of the distribution and its predictive accuracy, and establish that one can almost always incorporate randomization with large variance without incurring a loss in accuracy. In other words, the conventional approach of using a fixed classifier in adversarial environments is generally Pareto suboptimal. Finally, we validate such conclusions on both synthetic and real-world classification problems.

Example applications include classifications for detecting spam email, network intrusion detection and credit card scoring. In fact as the gamut of application domains of machine learning grows, the possibility and opportunity for adversarial behavior will only increase. Till now, the standard assumption about modeling adversarial behavior has been to empower an adversary to change all features of the classifier sat will. The adversary pays a cost proportional to the size of 'attack'. We refer to this form of adversarial behavior as a dense feature attack. However, the aim of an adversary is not just to subvert a classifier but carry out data transformation in a way such that spam continues to appear like spam to the user as much as possible. We demonstrate that an adversary achieves this objective by carrying out a sparse feature attack. We design an algorithm to show how a classifier should be designed to be robust against sparse adversarial attacks. Our main insight is that sparse feature attacks are best defended by designing classifiers which use l1 regularizers. © 2014 IEEE.","Adversarial learning; l1 regularizer; Sparse modelling","Data mining; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Metadata; Adversarial learning; Credit cards; Data transformation; Machine learning techniques; Network intrusion detection; Regularizer; Sparse features; Standard assumptions; Classification (of information)","Dalvi, N., Domingos, P., Sanghai, M.S., Verma, D., Adversarial classification (2004) KDD '04: Proceedings of the Tenth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 99-108. , New York, NY, USA: ACM; Lowd, D., Meek, C., Adversarial learning (2005) KDD '05: Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM SIGKDD International Confer Ence on Knowledge Discovery in Data Mining, pp. 641-647. , New York, NY, USA: ACM; Globerson, A., Roweis, S., Nightmare at test time: Robust learning by feature deletion (2006) Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 353-360. , New York, NY, USA: ACM; Liu, W., Chawla, S., Mining adversarial patterns via regularized loss minimizati on (2010) Machine Learning, 81 (1), pp. 69-83; Brückner, M., Scheffer, T., Stackelberg games for adversarial prediction problems (2011) Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining.

Typically, they use a fixed operating point minimizing the expected cost / error. This allows a rational attacker to deliver invisible attacks just below the detection threshold. We model this situation as a non-zero sum normal form game capturing attacker's expected payoffs for detected and undetected attacks, and detector's costs for false positives and false negatives computed based on the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of the classifier. The analysis of Nash and Stackelberg equilibria reveals that using a randomized strategy over multiple operating points forces the rational attacker to design less efficient attacks and substantially lowers the expected cost of the detector. We present the equilibrium strategies for sample ROC curves from network intrusion detection system and evaluate the corresponding benefits. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.","adversarial machine learning; Game theory; misclassification cost; operating point selection; receiver operating characteristic",,"Biggio, B., Corona, I., Maiorca, D., Nelson, B., Šrndić, N., Laskov, P., Giacinto, G., Roli, F., Evasion attacks against machine learning at test time (2013) LNCS (LNAI), 8190, pp. 387-402. , Blockeel, H., Kersting, K., Nijssen, S., Železný, F.

Much of the current and past work has focused on algorithm development, data processing, and optimization. Lately, a subset of research has emerged which explores issues related to security. This research is gaining traction as systems employing these methods are being applied to both secure and adversarial environments. One of machine learning's biggest benefits, its data-driven versus logic-driven approach, is also a weakness if the data on which the models rely are corrupted. Adversaries could maliciously influence systems which address drift and data distribution changes using re-training and online learning. Our work is focused on exploring the resilience of various machine learning algorithms to these data-driven attacks. In this paper, we present our initial findings using Monte Carlo simulations, and statistical analysis, to explore the maximal achievable shift to a classification model, as well as the required amount of control over the data.","Adversarial Machine Learning; Hidden Markov Models; Intrusion Detection; Monte Carlo","Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Computer programming; E-learning; Hidden Markov models; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Monte Carlo methods; Online systems; Adversarial environments; Algorithm development; Classification models; Conventional computers; Data distribution; Online learning; Programming logic; Learning algorithms","Ariu, D., (2010) Host and Network Based Anomaly Detectors for HTTP Attacks, , Diss.

Most anomaly detectors rely on machine learning algorithms to derive a model of normality that is later used to detect suspicious events. Such algorithms, however, are generally susceptible to evasion by means of carefully constructed attacks that are not recognized as anomalous. Different strategies to thwart evasion have been proposed over the last years, including the use of randomization to make somewhat uncertain how each packet will be processed. In this paper we analyze the strength of the randomization strategy suggested for Anagram, a well-known anomaly detector based on n-gram models. We show that an adversary who can interact with the system for a short period of time with inputs of his choosing will be able to recover the secret mask used to process packets. We describe and discuss an efficient algorithm to do this and report our experiences with a prototype implementation. Furthermore, we show that the specific form of randomization suggested for Anagram is a double-edged sword, as knowledge of the mask makes evasion easier than in the non-randomized case. We finally discuss a simple countermeasure to prevent our attacks. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Adversarial classification; Anomaly detection; Evasion attacks; Intrusion detection systems; Keywords","Computer crime; Learning algorithms; Adversarial classifications; Anomaly detection; Evasion attacks; Intrusion Detection Systems; Keywords; Random processes","Ariu, D., Tronci, R., Giacinto, G., HMMPayl an intrusion detection system based on hidden Markov models (2011) Comput Secur, 30, pp. 221-241; Aziz, A., Salama, M., Ella Hassanien, A., El-Ola Hanafi, S., Detectors generation using genetic algorithm for a negative selection inspired anomaly network intrusion detection system (2012) 2012 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS), pp. 597-602; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure?

Most of these detection schemes build model of run-time behavior of a process on the basis of its data flow and/or sequence of system calls. These novel techniques have shown promising results but an efficient and effective technique must meet the following performance metrics: (1) high detection accuracy, (2) low false alarm rate, (3) small detection time, and (4) the technique should be resilient to run-time evasion attempts. To meet these challenges, a novel concept of genetic footprint is proposed, by mining the information in the kernel process control blocks (PCB) of a process, that can be used to detect malicious processes at run time. The genetic footprint consists of selected parameters-maintained inside the PCB of a kernel for each running process-that define the semantics and behavior of an executing process. A systematic forensic study of the execution traces of benign and malware processes is performed to identify discriminatory parameters of a PCB (taskuct is PCB in case of Linux OS). As a result, 16 out of 118 task structure parameters are short listed using the time series analysis. A statistical analysis is done to corroborate the features of the genetic footprint and to select suitable machine learning classifiers to detect malware. The scheme has been evaluated on a dataset that consists of 105 benign processes and 114 recently collected malware processes for Linux. The results of experiments show that the presented scheme achieves a detection accuracy of 96% with 0% false alarm rate in less than 100 ms of the start of a malicious activity. Last but not least, the presented technique utilizes partial knowledge that is available at a given time while the process is still executing; as a result, the kernel of OS can devise mitigation strategies. It is also shown that the presented technique is robust to well known run-time evasion attempts.","Intrusion detection system; Kernel task structure; Malicious process detection; Malware forensic; Operating system security","Intrusion Detection Systems; Malwares; Operating system security; Process detection; Task structure; Computer operating systems; Data flow analysis; Errors; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Process control; Semantics; Time series analysis; Computer crime","Elf-x23 Virus Description, Trendmicro - An Online Malware Descriptions Database, , http://threatinfo.trendmicro.com, (last-viewed-on 05.11.10); Grsecurity, Complete Documentation for the Pax Project, , http://pax.grsecurity.net/docs/; Kaitan Backdoor Description, Symantec-An Antivirus Solution Provider, , http://www.symantec.com, (last-viewed-on 05.11.10); Satyr Virus Desciption, Virus-List-A Malware Description Database, , http://www.viruslist.com, (last-viewed-on 05.11.10); Sorso-b4264 Net-Worm Description, Symantec-An Antivirus Solution Provider, , http://www.symantec.com, (last-viewed-on 05.11.10); Ahmed, F., Hameed, H., Shafiq, M.Z., Farooq, M., Using spatio-temporal information in API calls with machine learning algorithms for malware detection (2009) Proceedings of the 2nd ACM Workshop on Security and Artificial Intelligence; Bayer, U., Moser, A., Kruegel, C., Kirda, E., Dynamic analysis of malicious code (2006) Journal in Computer Virology, 2 (1), pp. 67-77; Brodley, C., Friedl, M., Identifying mislabeled training data (1999) Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 11, pp. 131-167; Bruschi, D., Martignoni, L., Monga, M., Di Milano, U., Detecting self-mutating malware using control-flow graph matching (2006) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4064; Casas-Garriga, G., Diaz, P., Balcazar, J., (2005) ISSA: An Integrated System for Sequence Analysis, Technical Report DELIS-TR-0103, , Universitat Paderborn; Castro, M., Costa, M., Harris, T., Securing software by enforcing data-flow integrity (2006) Proceedings of the 7th Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation; Christodorescu, M., Jha, S., Testing malware detectors (2004) ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes, 29 (4), pp. 34-44; Christodorescu, M., Jha, S., Seshia, S., Song, D., Bryant, R., Semantics-aware malware detection (2005) IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy; Et Al., M.F., Symantec Global Internet Security Threat Report: Trends for 2009, 25. , Symantec 2010; Feng, H., Giffin, J., Huang, Y., Jha, S., Lee, W., Miller, B., Formalizing sensitivity in static analysis for intrusion detection (2004) IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy; Fisch, D., Hofmann, A., Sick, B., On the versatility of radial basis function neural networks: A case study in the field of intrusion detection (2010) Information Sciences, 180 (12), pp. 2421-2439; Forrest, S., Hofmeyr, S., Somayaji, A., Longstaff, T., A sense of self for Unix processes (1996) IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy; Gao, D., Reiter, M., Song, D., Behavioral distance measurement using hidden markov models (2006) Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection; Giffin, J., Jha, S., Miller, B., Efficient context-sensitive intrusion detection (2004) Proceedings of the 11th Network and Distributed System Security Symposium; Hund, R., Holz, T., Freiling, F., Return-oriented rootkits: Bypassing kernel code integrity protection mechanisms (2009) Proceedings of the USENIX Security Symposium; M.

RTFF was designed with the goal of scaling to high volume data feeds that are common in large Tier-1 ISP networks and providing rich, timely information on observed attacks. It is a software solution that is designed to run on off-the-shelf hardware platforms and incorporates a scalable data processing architecture along with lightweight analysis algorithms that make it suitable for deployment in large networks. RTFF also makes use of state of the art machine learning algorithms to construct attack models that can be used to detect as well as predict attacks.","Intrusion detection; Network security; Scaling",,"(2011) Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report, 7. , Arbor Networks; Phaal, P., Panchen, S., Mckee, N., InMon Corporation's sFlow: A method for monitoring traffic in switched and routed networks (2001), IETF RFC 3176.

However, the predictive performance of purely unsupervised anomaly detection often fails to match the required detection rates in many tasks and there exists a need for labeled data to guide the model generation. Our first contribution shows that classical semi-supervised approaches, originating from a supervised classifier, are inappropriate and hardly detect new and unknown anomalies. We argue that semi-supervised anomaly detection needs to ground on the unsupervised learning paradigm and devise a novel algorithm that meets this requirement. Although being intrinsically non-convex, we further show that the optimization problem has a convex equivalent under relatively mild assumptions. Additionally, we propose an active learning strategy to automatically filter candidates for labeling. In an empirical study on network intrusion detection data, we observe that the proposed learning methodology requires much less labeled data than the state-of-the-art, while achieving higher detection accuracies. © 2013 AI Access Foundation.

We design an adaptive IDS that has 10% higher accuracy than the best of four different baseline IDSs. Rather than creating a new 'super' IDS, we combine the outputs of the IDSs by using the online learning framework proposed by Bousquet and Warmuth [1]. The combination framework allows to dynamically determine the best IDSs performed in different segments of a dataset. Moreover, to increase the accuracy and reliability of the intrusion detection results, the fusion between outputs of the four IDSs is taken into account by a new expanded framework. We conduct the experiments on two different datasets for benchmarking Web Application Firewalls: the ECML-PKDD 2007 HTTP dataset and the CISIC HTTP 2010. Experimental results show the high adaptability of the proposed IDS. © 2012 IEEE.","adaptability; adversarial learning; intrusion detection; online machine learning; Web attack detection","adaptability; Adversarial learning; Adversarial networks; Expanded frameworks; Intrusion Detection Systems; Online learning; Web application firewalls; Web attacks; Computer crime; HTTP; Intelligent systems; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; E-learning","Bousquet, O., Warmuth, M.K., Tracking a small set of experts by mixing past posteriors (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 363-396. , Mar; Cesa-Bianchi, N., Freund, Y., Haussler, D., Helmbold, D.P., Schapire, R.E., Warmuth, M.K., How to use expert advice (1997) Journal of the ACM, 44 (3), pp. 427-485. , May; Corona, I., Giacinto, G., Roli, F., Intrusion detection in computer systems using multiple classifier systems (2008) Supervised and Unsupervised Ensemble Methods and Their Applications of Studies in Computational Intelligence, 126, pp. 91-113. , O.

In such cases, learning algorithms may have to cope with manipulated data aimed at hampering decision making. Although some previous work addressed the issue of handling malicious data in the context of supervised learning, very little is known about the behavior of anomaly detection methods in such scenarios. In this contribution,1 we analyze the performance of a particular method-online centroid anomaly detection-in the presence of adversarial noise. Our analysis addresses the following security-related issues: formalization of learning and attack processes, derivation of an optimal attack, and analysis of attack efficiency and limitations. We derive bounds on the effectiveness of a poisoning attack against centroid anomaly detection under different conditions: attacker's full or limited control over the traffic and bounded false positive rate. Our bounds show that whereas a poisoning attack can be effectively staged in the unconstrained case, it can be made arbitrarily difficult (a strict upper bound on the attacker's gain) if external constraints are properly used. Our experimental evaluation, carried out on real traces of HTTP and exploit traffic, confirms the tightness of our theoretical bounds and the practicality of our protection mechanisms. © 2012 Marius Kloft and Pavel Laskov.","Adversarial; Anomaly detection; Computer security; Network intrusion detection; Security analysis; Support vector data description","Adversarial; Anomaly detection; Network intrusion detection; Security analysis; Support vector data description; Data description; Data handling; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Security of data; Security systems","Angluin, D., Laird, P., Learning from noisy examples (1988) Machine Learning, 2 (4), pp. 434-470; Auer, P., Learning nested differences in the presence of malicious noise (1997) Theoretical Computer Science, 185 (1), pp. 159-175. , PII S0304397597000194; Bailey, M., Oberheide, J., Andersen, J., Mao, Z.M., Jahanian, F., Nazario, J., Automated classification and analysis of internet malware (2007) Recent Adances in Intrusion Detection (RAID), pages 178-197; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A., Tygar, J., Can machine learning be secure (2006) ACM Symposium on Information, Computer and Communication Security, pp. 16-25; Barreno, M., Bartlett, P.L., Chi, F.J., Joseph, A.D., Nelson, B., Rubinstein, B.I., Saini, U., Tygar, J.D., Open problems in the security of learning (2008) AISec '08: Proceedings of the 1st ACM workshop on Workshop on AISec, pp. 19-26. , New York, NY, USA, ACM; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., The security of machine learning (2010) Machine Learning, 81 (2), pp. 121-148; Boser Bernhard, E., Guyon Isabelle, M., Vapnik Vladimir, N., Training algorithm for optimal margin classifiers (1992) Proceedings of the Fifth Annual ACM Workshop on Computational Learning Theory, pp. 144-152; Braun, M.L., Buhmann, J., M̌uller, K.-R., On relevant dimensions in kernel feature spaces (2008) Journal Of Machine Learning Research, 9, pp. 1875-1908. , Aug; Bschouty, N.H., Eiron, N., Kushilevitz, E., Pac learning with nasty noise (1999) Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT 1999), pp. 206-218; Cretu, G., Stavrou, A., Locasto, M., Stolfo, S., Keromytis, A., Casting out demons: Sanitizing training data for anomaly sensors (2008) Proc. of IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 81-95; Cretu-Ciocarlie, G.F., Stavrou, A., Locasto, M.E., Stolfo, S.J., Adaptive anomaly detection via self-calibration and dynamic updating (2009) Recent Adances in Intrusion Detection (RAID), pp. 41-60; Dalvi, N., Domingos, P., Sumit, M., Verma, S.D., (2004) Adversarial Classification KDD, pp. 99-108. , ACM Press; Dekel, O., Shamir, O., Learning to classify with missing and corrupted features (2008) International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pp. 216-223; Dekel, O., Shamir, O., Xiao, L., Learning to classify with missing and corrupted features (2009) Machine Learning; Fogla, P., Lee, W., Evading network anomaly detection systems: Formal reasoning and practical techniques (2006) Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 59-68. , DOI 10.1145/1180405.1180414, 1180414, CCS 2006: Proceedings of the 13th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security; Fogla, P., Sharif, M., Perdisci, R., Kolesnikov, O., Lee, W., Polymorphic blending attacks (2006) Proc. of USENIX Security Symposium, pp. 241-256; Forrest, S., Hofmeyr, S., Somayaji, A., Longstaff, T., A sense of self for unix processes (1996) Proc. of IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 120-128. , Oakland, CA, USA; Globerson, A., Roweis, S., Nightmare at test time: Robust learning by feature deletion (2006) International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pp. 353-360; Hofmeyr, S., Forrest, S., Somayaji, A., Intrusion detection using sequences of system calls (1998) Journal of Computer Security, 6 (3), pp. 151-180; Kearns Michael, Li Ming, Learning in the presence of malicious errors (1993) SIAM Journal on Computing, 22 (4), pp. 807-837; Laskov, P., Kloft, M., A framework for quantitative security analysis of machine learning (2009) AISec ACM, pp. 1-4. , D.

Itappears thatsystem security strategy cannothope to even achieve parity withouta comparable self-organizing strategy. Toward thatend a project is underway to catalog re-usable patterns of self-organizing security of many kinds, principally found in natural systems, butalso seen in recent computational approaches. One class of pattern of special interest involves discovery of previously unseen threats and attacks. In general this class of pattern has aspects of learning, innovation, and evolution as capability objectives. The genetic algorithm is one such pattern. Another such pattern is seen in artificial neural networks. Combining the two into a Genetic Algorithm augmented Neural Network, often called GANN, has considerable recenthistory in the literature. Not many of these are directly related to security applications. Some security-application work shows GANNs employed for feature selection provide enhanced learning performance and accuracy, and avoidance of local minimum traps. This paper adds the GANN pattern to the self-organizing security pattern catalog, and applies the pattern to a self-organizing security application under development. © 2012 IEEE.","GANN; intrusion detection; SAREPH","Community IS; Computational approach; Enhanced learning; GANN; Local minimums; Natural systems; SAREPH; Security application; Security patterns; Security strategies; Self organizing; System-of-systems; Threats and attacks; Genetic algorithms; Intrusion detection; Neural networks","Dove, R., Shirey, L., (2010) On Discovery and Display of Agile Security Patterns, , www.parshift.com/Files/PsiDocs/Pap100317Cser- OnDiscoveryAndDisplayOfAgileSecurityPatterns.pdf, Conference on System Engineering Research, Hoboken, NJ (US),17-19 Mar; Dove, R., Pattern qualifications and examples of next-generation agile system-security strategies (2010) IEEE International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology (ICCST), , www.parshift.com/Files/PsiDocs/PatternQualificationsForAgileSecurity.pdf, San Jose, CA (US), 5-8 Oct; Dove, R., www.parshift.com/s/110411PatternsForSORNS.pdf, Patterns of self-organizing agile security for resilient network situational awareness and sensemaking' 8th International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations (ITNG), Las; Alexander, C., (1977) A Pattern Language: Towns, , Buildings, Constructio, Oxford University Press; Messenger, R., Dove, R., Basic genetic algorithm pattern for use in self-organizing agile security (2012) IEEE International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology (ICCST), , Boston, MA (US),15-18 Oct; Montana, D., Davis, L., Training feedforward neural networks using genetic algorithms (1989) International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 762-767. , Detroit, MI (US), 20-25 Aug; Floreano, D., Dürr, P., Claudio mattiussi (2008) Neuroevolution: From Architectures to Learning, EvolutionaryIntelligence, 1 (1), pp. 47-62; Dewri, R., (2003) Evolutionary Neural Networks: Design Methodologies, , http://ai-depot.com/articles/evolutionary-neural-networks-design- methodologies/, Published online by ai-depot, 24 Mar; Floreano, D., Keller, L., Evolution of adaptive behaviour in robots by means of darwinian selection (2010) PLoS Biol, 81, pp. e1000292. , Jan; Tong, D.L., Mintram, R., Genetic algorithm-neural network (gann): A study of neural network activation functions and depth of genetic algorithm search applied to feature selection (2010) International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics, 1, pp. 75-87; Floreano, D., Nolfi, S., God save the red queen!

The purpose of this paper was to reveal how active learning can be attacked in such environments. In this paper, three contributions were made: first, we analyzed the sampling vulnerability of active learning; second, we presented a game framework of attack against active learning; third, two sampling attack methods were proposed, including the adding attack and the deleting attack.

Among them, several systems exploit Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition techniques, by regarding malicious behavior detection as a classification problem. Supervised and unsupervised algorithms have been used in this context, each one with its own benefits and shortcomings. When using supervised techniques, a representative training set is required, which reliably indicates what a human expert wants the system to learn and recognize, by means of suitably labeled samples. In real environments there is a significant difficulty in collecting a representative dataset of correctly labeled traffic traces. In adversarial environments such a task is made even harder by malicious attackers, trying to make their actions' evidences stealthy. In order to overcome this problem, a self-training system is presented in this paper, building a dataset of labeled network traffic based on raw tcpdump traces and no prior knowledge on data. Results on both emulated and real traffic traces have shown that intrusion detection systems trained on such a dataset perform as well as the same systems trained on correctly hand-labeled data.© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, besides achieving good classification performances, machine learning algorithms have to be robust against adversarial data manipulation to successfully operate in these tasks. While support vector machines (SVMs) have shown to be a very successful approach in classification problems, their effectiveness in adversarial classification tasks has not been extensively investigated yet. In this paper we present a preliminary investigation of the robustness of SVMs against adversarial data manipulation. In particular, we assume that the adversary has control over some training data, and aims to subvert the SVM learning process. Within this assumption, we show that this is indeed possible, and propose a strategy to improve the robustness of SVMs to training data manipulation based on a simple kernel matrix correction. © 2011 B.

Machine learning technique has been applied widely in various applications especially in spam detection and network intrusion detection. Most existing learning schemes assume that the environment they settle in is benign. However this is not always true in the real adversarial decision-making situations where the future data sets and the training data set are no longer from the same population, due to the transformations employed by the adversaries. As more and more machine learning systems are put into use, it is imperative to consider the security of the machine learning system. As a emerging problem, it is attracting more and more researchers' attention. In this article, we present a brief overview on secure machine learning and current progress on developing secure machine learning algorithms. © 2011 IEEE.","Overview; Secure machine learning","Data sets; Learning schemes; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Network intrusion detection; Overview; Research problems; Spam detection; Training data sets; C (programming language); Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Population statistics; Software reliability; Learning algorithms","Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., The security of machine learning (2010) Mach.
