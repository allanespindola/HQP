Even a Cyber-Manufacturing System (CMS) that is equipped with the most effective intrusion detection system is vulnerable to insider threats. Insiders who are in the security parameter of a manufacturing system can easily incapacitate it with their authenticated access to the system. In order to devise ways to address the insider threats in CMS, a testbed was developed. To validate and evaluate the usefulness of the testbed for adversarial insider attacks, three physical audits and their results are presented with two case studies.}

abstract = {Embedded systems (electronic systems with a dedicated purpose that are part of larger devices) are increasing their relevance with the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT). Such systems are often resource constrained, battery powered, connected to the internet, and exposed to an increasing number of threats. An approach to detect such threats is through an anomaly-based intrusion detection with machine-learning techniques. However, most of these techniques were not created with energy efficiency in mind. This paper presents an anomaly-based method for network intrusion detection in embedded systems. The proposed method maintains the classifier reliability even when network traffic contents changes. The reliability is achieved through a new rejection mechanism and a combination of classifiers. The proposed approach is energy-efficient and well suited for hardware implementation. The experiments presented in this paper show that the hardware versions of the machine learning algorithms consume 46% of the energy used by their software counterparts, and the feature extraction and packet capture modules consume 58% and 37% of their respective software counterparts.}

If a suspicious packet is found, an expert may help BigFlow to incrementally change the classification model. Experiments with BigFlow, over a network traffic dataset spanning a full year, demonstrate that it can maintain high accuracy over time.

BigFlow is scalable, coping with a 10-Gbps network bandwidth in a 40-core cluster commodity hardware.}

Consequently, this paper proposes a new multivariate ensemble classification (MEC) method to detect intrusions in CPES, thereby enhancing the baseline cybersecurity of CPES. MEC simultaneously takes into account the detection accuracy, stability and computing efficiency. In MEC, extreme gradient boosting, light gradient boosting machine and extreme learning machine are separately designed as individual detectors for intrusion identification. Then, ensemble learning based decision-making is developed to strategically aggregate the results of all individual detectors. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed MEC is validated on IEEE standard 14-, 57- and 118-bus systems. The obtained results demonstrate that the MEC method has an attractive potential in real applications.}

abstract = {Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e., carefully-crafted inputs that mislead classification at test time. Recent defenses have been shown to improve adversarial robustness by detecting anomalous deviations from legitimate training samples at different layer representations - a behavior normally exhibited by adversarial attacks. Despite technical differences, all aforementioned methods share a common backbone structure that we formalize and highlight in this contribution, as it can help in identifying promising research directions and drawbacks of existing methods. The first main contribution of this work is the review of these detection methods in the form of a unifying framework designed to accommodate both existing defenses and newer ones to come. In terms of drawbacks, the overmentioned defenses require comparing input samples against an oversized number of reference prototypes, possibly at different representation layers, dramatically worsening the test-time efficiency. Besides, such defenses are typically based on ensembling classifiers with heuristic methods, rather than optimizing the whole architecture in an end-to-end manner to better perform detection. As a second main contribution of this work, we introduce FADER, a novel technique for speeding up detection-based methods. FADER overcome the issues above by employing RBF networks as detectors: by fixing the number of required prototypes, the runtime complexity of adversarial examples detectors can be controlled. Our experiments outline up to 73× prototypes reduction compared to analyzed detectors for MNIST dataset, up to 50× for CIFAR10 dataset, and up to 82× on ImageNet10 dataset respectively, without sacrificing classification accuracy on both clean and adversarial data.}

However, this assumption does not always hold, as it is often advantageous to adversaries to maliciously modify the training (poisoning attacks) or test data (evasion attacks). Such attacks can be catastrophic given the growth and the penetration of machine learning applications in society. Therefore, there is a need to secure machine learning enabling the safe adoption of it in adversarial cases, such as spam filtering, malware detection, and biometric recognition. This paper presents a taxonomy and survey of attacks against systems that use machine learning. It organizes the body of knowledge in adversarial machine learning so as to identify the aspects where researchers from different fields can contribute to. The taxonomy identifies attacks which share key characteristics and as such can potentially be addressed by the same defence approaches. Thus, the proposed taxonomy makes it easier to understand the existing attack landscape towards developing defence mechanisms, which are not investigated in this survey. The taxonomy is also leveraged to identify open problems that can lead to new research areas within the field of adversarial machine learning.}

Therefore, it is crucial to employ intrusion detection techniques to mitigate attacks that exploit IoT security vulnerabilities. However, due to the limited capabilities of IoT devices and the specific protocols used, conventional intrusion detection mechanisms may not work well for IoT environments. In this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection model that uses machine learning to effectively detect cyber-attacks and anomalies in resource-constraint IoT networks. Through a set of optimizations including removal of multicollinearity, sampling, and dimensionality reduction, our model can identify the most important features to detect intrusions using much fewer training data and less training time. Extensive experiments were performed on the CICIDS2017 and NSL-KDD datasets respectively to evaluate the proposed approach. The experimental results on two popular datasets show that our model has a high detection rate and a low false alarm rate. It outperforms existing models in multiple performance metrics and is consistent in classifying major cyber-attacks, respectively. Most importantly, unlike traditional resource-intensive intrusion detection systems, the proposed model is lightweight and can be deployed on IoT nodes with limited power and storage capabilities.}

abstract = {Designing an effective network intrusion system (IDS) is a challenging problem because of the emergence of a large number of novel attacks and heterogeneous network applications. The existing IDSs fail to adapt to the changing attack patterns and unseen attacks that lead to inaccurate detection of network vulnerabilities and system performance degradation. Therefore, there is a need to design robust, scalable, efficient, and adaptive IDS for networks. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning-based IDS that employs Deep Q-Network logic in multiple distributed agents and uses attention mechanisms to efficiently detect and classify advanced network attacks. Our proposed multi-agent IDS is designed as a distributed attack detection platform where agents work in a coordinated manner to provide scalable, fault-tolerant, multi-view architecture guided security system. We have tested our model with extensive experimentation on two benchmark datasets: NSL-KDD and CICIDS2017. It shows improved performance in terms of higher accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, and low false-positive rate (FPR) in comparison to the state-of-the-art IDS works. On the other hand, many machine learning systems are found vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Thus, we evaluated our model’s robustness against a practical black-box adversarial attack and observed only a little degradation in performance. We integrated the concept of denoising autoencoder (DAE) with our model to further improve its robustness. Finally, we discuss the usability of our system in real-life applications against zero-day attack patterns.}

Contemporary web servers are increasingly vulnerable to such attacks. With the emergence of HTTP/2 as the successor of HTTP/1.x, existing techniques for detecting DoS attacks will not be entirely effective. Though nearly 90% of all contemporary web servers as yet have not migrated to HTTP/2, DoS attack modelling and detection is essential to prevent impending attacks of such kind from the adversary class. This study presents a model of DoS attack traffic that can be directed towards HTTP/2 web servers. The research conducted also extends previous studies that provided DoS attack models against HTTP/2 services, to present a novel and stealthy DoS attack variant that can disrupt routine web services, covertly. The attack traffic analysis conducted in this study employed four machine learning techniques, namely Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, JRip and Support Vector Machines, and stealthy traffic properties are shown through having higher percentages of False Alarms. Results obtained through simulation show promise, and arguments are put forth on how future work can extend the proposed model to create further attack traffic models that may cause severe web service disruptions.}

Recently, cognitive computing and artificial intelligence techniques offer new opportunities for the revolution of industrial CPSs. Therefore, to achieve security in industrial CPS, AI based intrusion detection system (IDS) can be developed to detect anomalies and prevent their harmful effects. With this motivation, this paper presents a novel cognitive computing based IDS technique to achieve security in industrial CPS. The proposed model involves different stages of operations such as data acquisition, preprocessing, feature selection, classification, and parameter optimization. The proposed model involves preprocessing to discard the noise that exists in the data. Then, the presented model uses binary bacterial foraging optimization (BBFO) based feature selection technique to elect an optimal subset of features. Besides the gated recurrent unit (GRU) model is applied to identify the presence of intrusions in the industrial CPS environment. Finally, Nesterov-accelerated Adaptive Moment Estimation (NADAM) optimizer is applied for the hyperparameter optimization of the GRU model in such a way that the detection rate can be enhanced. In order to validate the performance of the BBFO-GRU model, a series of experiments were carried out using the data from industrial CPS and the resultant values highlighted the promising performance of the proposed model with an accuracy of 98.45%.}

In this paper, we first introduce a taxonomy of deep learning models in intrusion detection and summarize the research papers on this topic. Then we train and evaluate four key deep learning models - feed-forward neural network, autoencoder, deep belief network and long short-term memory network - for the intrusion classification task on two legacy datasets (KDD 99, NSL-KDD) and two modern datasets (CIC-IDS2017, CIC-IDS2018).

The results also indicate that two popular semi-supervised learning models, autoencoders and deep belief networks do not perform better than supervised feed-forward neural networks. The implementation and the complete set of results have been released for future use by the research community.

This paper illustrates a deep learning methodology for the binary classification of the network traffic. The basic idea is to represent network flows as 2D images and use this imagery representation of the network traffic to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The GAN is trained to produce new images of unforeseen network attacks by augmenting the training data used to learn a CNN-based intrusion detection model. The advantage is that the 2D data mapping technique used builds images of the network flows, which allow us to take advantage of deep learning architectures with convolution layers. In addition, the GAN-based data augmentation allows us to deal with the possible imbalance of malicious traffic that is commonly rarer than the normal traffic in the network traffic. Specifically, it is used to simulate unforeseen attacks to train a robust intrusion detection model. The proposed methodology leads to better predictive accuracy when compared to competitive intrusion detection architectures on four benchmark datasets.}

abstract = {Aiming at the poor performance and flexibility of traditional assessment methods of network security in dealing with a large number of network attack data, this paper proposes a network security situation assessment method based on adversarial deep learning. Firstly, establish the Deep Autoencoder-Deep Neural Network (AEDNN) model based on Deep Autoencoder (DAE) and Deep Neural Network (DNN). Conduct feature learning on the DAE network and apply the DNN network as a network attacks classifier. In the training process, for considering the results of feature learning in DAE, this paper builds an adversarial training process by changing the training weights. Besides, to increase the performance of the model on the minority network attacks, the Under–Over Sampling Weighted (UOSW) algorithm is designed; Finally, conduct model testing and calculate the network security situation value. The compared results of other models show the proposed model is more accurate for identifying network attacks and can evaluate the network situation more comprehensively and flexibly.}

In this paper, two types of ensemble-based black-box attack strategies, selective cascade ensemble strategy (SCES) and stack parallel ensemble strategy (SPES), are proposed to explore the vulnerability of DL system and potential factors that contribute to the high-efficiency attacks are explored. SCES adopts a boosting structure of ensemble learning and SPES employs a bagging structure. Moreover, two pairwise and non-pairwise diversity measures are adopted to examine the relationship between the diversity in substitutes ensembles and transferability of generated adversarial examples. Experimental results show that proposed ensemble adversarial black-box attack strategies can successfully attack the DL system with some defense mechanism, such as adversarial training and ensemble adversarial training. The experimental results also show the greater the diversity in substitute ensembles enables stronger transferability.}

abstract = {Contrastive learning makes it possible to establish similarities between samples by comparing their distances in an intermediate representation space (embedding space) and using loss functions designed to attract/repel similar/dissimilar samples. The distance comparison is based exclusively on the sample features. We propose a novel contrastive learning scheme by including the labels in the same embedding space as the features and performing the distance comparison between features and labels in this shared embedding space. Following this idea, the sample features should be close to its ground-truth (positive) label and away from the other labels (negative labels). This scheme allows to implement a supervised classification based on contrastive learning. Each embedded label will assume the role of a class prototype in embedding space, with sample features that share the label gathering around it. The aim is to separate the label prototypes while minimizing the distance between each prototype and its same-class samples. A novel set of loss functions is proposed with this objective. Loss minimization will drive the allocation of sample features and labels in embedding space. Loss functions and their associated training and prediction architectures are analyzed in detail, along with different strategies for label separation. The proposed scheme drastically reduces the number of pair-wise comparisons, thus improving model performance. In order to further reduce the number of pair-wise comparisons, this initial scheme is extended by replacing the set of negative labels by its best single representative: either the negative label nearest to the sample features or the centroid of the cluster of negative labels. This idea creates a new subset of models which are analyzed in detail. The outputs of the proposed models are the distances (in embedding space) between each sample and the label prototypes. These distances can be used to perform classification (minimum distance label), features dimensionality reduction (using the distances and the embeddings instead of the original features) and data visualization (with 2 or 3D embeddings). Although the proposed models are generic, their application and performance evaluation is done here for network intrusion detection, characterized by noisy and unbalanced labels and a challenging classification of the various types of attacks. Empirical results of the model applied to intrusion detection are presented in detail for two well-known intrusion detection datasets, and a thorough set of classification and clustering performance evaluation metrics are included.}

abstract = {Combination of edge computing technologies and machine learning help to put edge intelligence into practice. Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is one of its most typical applications. But this system can be easily attacked in the process of using edge computing center to process localized perception data. Intrusion detection technologies based on machine learning provide strong security for edge computing center, in which the most widely used is gradient boosting decision tree (i.e., GBDT). But still this model faces with problems such as imbalanced data, high dimensional data characteristics, and low efficiency of parameter optimization. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an optimization scheme for GBDT to improve its detection precision and training efficiency. First, to solve the problem of imbalanced data in data set, we propose a margin synthetic minority oversampling technique (i.e., MSMOTE), which can expand the non-noise data with less sample size, namely, small sample, to ensure equilibrium distribution of data. Second, to lower the data feature dimensionality, we propose a recursive feature elimination-hierarchy cross validation algorithm (i.e., RFE-HCV). The new algorithm eliminates redundant data features recursively according to feature weight, to strengthen the relationship between features and goals. It also designs hierarchy system to ensure equal proportionment of data category (attack category) in training set and testing set at cross validation stage. Next, in order to improve the efficiency of parameter optimization in model training process, we develop a flexible grid search algorithm (i.e., FGS) to improve retrieval efficiency of optimum parameters. Finally, the detailed experimental results show that our new scheme ensures data balance in dataset and eliminates redundant data features, and helps the efficiency of parameter optimization increase by three times. Moreover, the new scheme defends against intrusion more effectively.}

In this research, we propose an alternative metric learning approach for adversarial sample classification. This approach integrates relative information as well as absolute pairwise information into a differentiable decision tree representation to guarantee a more robust classifier. We term this metric learning approach as differentiable decision tree pairwise metric learning (DTML). We demonstrate that DTML is more robust even under strong adversarial untargeted attacks compared with the single Mahalanobis distance-based defending methods on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and KDDCUP99 datasets.}

Recent proposals have explored charging EVs on the move, using dynamic wireless charging that enables power exchange between the vehicle and the grid while the vehicle is moving. Specifically, part of the literature focuses on the intelligent routing of EVs in need of charging. Inter-Vehicle communications (IVC) play an integral role in intelligent routing of EVs around a static charging station or dynamic charging on the road network. However, IVC is vulnerable to a variety of cyber attacks such as spoofing. In this paper, a probabilistic cross-layer Intrusion Detection System (IDS), based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques, is introduced. The proposed IDS is capable of detecting spoofing attacks with more than 90% accuracy. The IDS uses a new metric, Position Verification using Relative Speed (PVRS), which seems to have a significant effect in classification results. PVRS compares the distance between two communicating nodes that is observed by On-Board Units (OBU) and their estimated distance using the relative speed value that is calculated using interchanged signals in the Physical (PHY) layer.}

However, given the increasing diversity of attack behaviors, efficient detection becomes more challenging. Machine learning (ML) has recently dominated as one of the most promising techniques to improve detection accuracy for intrusion detection systems(IDS). With ML-based approaches, a quality dataset for training holds the key to gain high detection performance. Unfortunately, there are few methods to assess the dataset quality, and specifically for ML training. This work presents an automated toolchain, termed CREME (Configuration, REproduction, Multi-dataset, and Evaluation), to generate a dataset and measure its quality and efficiency. CREME integrates various tools to automate all stages of configuration, attack and benign behavior reproduction, data collection, feature extraction, data labeling, and evaluation. CREME can also automatically collect and generate a dataset from multiple sources such as accounting, network traffic, and system logs. Compared with the available datasets in the same category, experiment results show that the datasets generated by CREME contribute up to 20% better performance to ML-based IDS in terms of coverage. They also have significantly better efficiency than most other datasets. The CREME source code is available at https://github.com/buihuukhoi/CREME.}

abstract = {With the growing threat of cyber and cyber-physical attacks against automobiles, drones, ships, driverless pods and other vehicles, there is also a growing need for intrusion detection approaches that can facilitate defence against such threats. Vehicles tend to have limited processing resources and are energy-constrained. So, any security provision needs to abide by these limitations. At the same time, attacks against vehicles are very rare, often making knowledge-based intrusion detection systems less practical than behaviour-based ones, which is the reverse of what is seen in conventional computing systems. Furthermore, vehicle design and implementation can differ wildly between different types or different manufacturers, which can lead to intrusion detection designs that are vehicle-specific. Equally importantly, vehicles are practically defined by their ability to move, autonomously or not. Movement, as well as other physical manifestations of their operation may allow cyber security breaches to lead to physical damage, but can also be an opportunity for detection. For example, physical sensing can contribute to more accurate or more rapid intrusion detection through observation and analysis of physical manifestations of a security breach. This paper presents a classification and survey of intrusion detection systems designed and evaluated specifically on vehicles and networks of vehicles. Its aim is to help identify existing techniques that can be adopted in the industry, along with their advantages and disadvantages, as well as to identify gaps in the literature, which are attractive and highly meaningful areas of future research.}

This field is especially relevant for applications where machine learning lies in the core of security systems. In the field of network security, adversarial samples are actually novel network attacks or old attacks with tuned properties. This paper proposes to blur classification boundaries in order to enhance machine learning robustness and improve the detection of adversarial samples that exploit learning weaknesses. We test this concept by an experimental setup with network traffic in which linear decision trees are wrapped by a one-class-membership scoring algorithm. We benchmark our proposal with plain linear decision trees and fuzzy decision trees. Results show that evasive attacks (i.e., false negatives) tend to be ranked with low class-membership levels, meaning that they are located in zones close to classification thresholds. In addition, classification performances improve when membership scores are added as new features. Using fuzzy class boundaries is highly consistent with the interpretation of many network traffic features used for malware detection; moreover, it prevents network attackers from exploiting classification boundaries as attack objectives.}

Due to these advancements, various new communication channels are being introduced, out of which the Internet of Things (IoT) plays a significant role. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a special category of IoT in which the medical devices communicate with each other for sharing sensitive data. These advancements help the healthcare industry to have better contact and care towards their patients. But they too have certain drawbacks since there are so many security and privacy issues like replay, man-in-the-middle, impersonation, privileged-insider, remote hijacking, password guessing, denial of service (DoS) attacks and malware attacks. When the sensitive data is being attacked by any of these attacks, there is a chance of losing the authorized data to the attacker or getting altered due to which the data is not available for the authorized users and customers. Machine learning algorithms are widely used in the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for detecting and classifying the attacks at the network and host level in a dynamic manner. Many supervised and unsupervised algorithms have been designed by researchers from the area of machine learning and data mining to identify the reliable detection of an anomaly. However, the main challenge in the IDS models are changed in dynamic and random behavior of malicious attacks and designing a scalable solution that can handle this behavior. The rapid change in network behavior and the fast evolution of various attacks paved the way for evaluating various datasets that are generated over the years and to design different dynamic approaches. In this paper, a deep neural network (DNN) is used to develop effective and efficient IDS in the IoMT environment to classify and predict unforeseen cyberattacks. The network parameter are preprocessed, optimized and tuned by hyperparameter selection methods. A comprehensive analysis of experiments in DNN with other machine learning algorithms are compared on the benchmark intrusion detection dataset. Through rigorous testing, it has proved that the proposed DNN model performs better than the existing machine learning approaches with an increase in accuracy by 15% and decreases in time complexity by 32%, which helps in faster alerts to avoid post effects of intrusion in sensitive cloud data storage.}

In particular, challenge-based mechanism attempts to identify malicious nodes by measuring the deviation between challenges and responses. However, it is found that such mechanisms may be vulnerable to advanced insider attacks like Passive Message Fingerprint Attacks (PMFA), where malicious nodes can distinguish challenges by analyzing the sending strategy. In this paper, we further analyze the effectiveness of PMFA and investigate whether an improved sending strategy can help detect malicious nodes. Our study reveals that PMFA could still be valid under even an improved sending strategy, i.e., malicious nodes can hold its reputation level by understanding the network context. We then provide some insights on how to defeat such kind of attack by properly adjusting such mechanism.}

For IDS technology to improve, a next-generation cyber defense is proposed in which cyber attacks are unconventionally reimagined as free sources of live IDS training data. Rather than aborting attacks against legitimate services, adversarial interactions are selectively prolonged to maximize the defender’s harvest of useful threat intelligence. Enhancing web services with deceptive attack-responses in this way is shown to be a powerful and practical strategy for improved detection, addressing several perennial challenges for machine learning-based IDS in the literature, including scarcity of training data, the high labeling burden for (semi-)supervised learning, encryption opacity, and concept differences between honeypot attacks and those against genuine services. By reconceptualizing software security patches as feature extraction engines, the approach conscripts attackers as free penetration testers, and coordinates multiple levels of the software stack to achieve fast, automatic, and accurate labeling of live web streams. Prototype implementations are showcased for two feature set models to extract security-relevant network- and system-level features from cloud services hosting enterprise-grade web applications. The evaluation demonstrates that the extracted data can be fed back into a network-level IDS for exceptionally accurate, yet lightweight attack detection.}

Recently, Deep Learning has become a powerful technique applied in cybersecurity, and many Network Intrusion Detection (NIDS) have been proposed in recent researches. Some studies have indicated that deep neural networks are sensitive in detecting adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks are instances with certain perturbations that cause deep neural networks to misclassify. In this paper, we proposed a detection and defense system based on Adversarial training in SDN , which uses Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework for detecting DDoS attacks and applies adversarial training to make the system less sensitive to adversarial attacks. The proposed system includes well-defined modules that enable continuous traffic monitoring using IP flow analysis, enabling the anomaly detection system to act in near-real-time. We conducted the experiments on two distinct scenarios, with emulated data and the public dataset CICDDoS 2019. Experimental results demonstrated that the system efficiently detected up-to-date common types of DDoS attacks compared to other approaches.}

Extensive research effort has been invested in anomaly-based network intrusion detection using machine learning techniques; however, in general these techniques remain a research topic, rarely being used in real-world environments. In general, the approaches proposed in the literature lack representative datasets and reliable evaluation methods that consider real-world network properties during the system evaluation. In general, the approaches adopt a set of assumptions about the training data, as well as about the validation methods, rendering the created system unreliable for open-world usage. This paper presents a new method for creating intrusion databases. The objective is that the databases should be easy to update and reproduce with real and valid traffic, representative, and publicly available. Using our proposed method, we propose a new evaluation scheme specific to the machine learning intrusion detection field. Sixteen intrusion databases were created, and each of the assumptions frequently adopted in studies in the intrusion detection literature regarding network traffic behavior was validated. To make machine learning detection schemes feasible, we propose a new multi-objective feature selection method that considers real-world network properties. The results show that most of the assumptions frequently applied in studies in the literature do not hold when using a machine learning detection scheme for network-based intrusion detection. However, the proposed multi-objective feature selection method allows the system accuracy to be improved by considering real-world network properties during the model creation process.}

abstract = {Nowadays intrusion detection systems are a mandatory weapon in the war against the ever-increasing amount of network cyber attacks. In this study we illustrate a new intrusion detection method that analyses the flow-based characteristics of the network traffic data. It learns an intrusion detection model by leveraging a deep metric learning methodology that originally combines autoencoders and Triplet networks. In the training stage, two separate autoencoders are trained on historical normal network flows and attacks, respectively. Then a Triplet network is trained to learn the embedding of the feature vector representation of network flows. This embedding moves each flow close to its reconstruction, restored with the autoencoder associated with the same class as the flow, and away from its reconstruction, restored with the autoencoder of the opposite class. The predictive stage assigns each new flow to the class associated with the autoencoder that restores the closest reconstruction of the flow in the embedding space. In this way, the predictive stage takes advantage of the embedding learned in the training stage, achieving a good prediction performance in the detection of new signs of malicious activities in the network traffic. In fact, the proposed methodology leads to better predictive accuracy when compared to competitive intrusion detection architectures on benchmark datasets.}

abstract = {In order to evaluate network trust, different intrusion detection methods have been proposed. However, it is difficult for a single detection node to collect massive data and perform detection and evaluation in a large-scale network. In addition, disclosure of security-related data and detection pattern might weaken data provision incentives due to privacy concern, which could result in deliberately forging data to evade detection. Current literature still lacks a general framework to conduct decentralized intrusion detection towards network trust evaluation with privacy preservation. In this paper, we propose SeDID, a Software Guard Extension (SGX)-enabled decentralized intrusion detection framework for network trust evaluation based on blockchain. We design a novel consensus mechanism to avoid forking and guarantee high efficiency and real decentralization, where block creation is uniquely consented by miners and block creation difficulty is determined by the number of blocks previously created by a relative miner within a time window. The smaller the number, the easier the miner creates a new block. SeDID also offers incentives according to node contributions for motivating security-related data collection, intrusion detection and network trust evaluation. Additional employment of Intel SGX makes SeDID preserve both data and pattern privacy. We analyze SeDID’s efficacy in terms of incentive, privacy preservation and security. Its performance is further evaluated through simulations. In specific settings, its block creation time, task completion time and throughput are 19.61s, 44.55s and 224.47 transactions/s, respectively. Compared with state-of-the-art systems, SeDID offers better performance, which implies its potential to be applied in practice.}

These adversarial samples are proved to evade state of the art detectors based on Machine- and Deep-Learning algorithms. The initial corpus of malicious samples consists of network flows belonging to different botnet families presented in three public datasets containing real enterprise network traffic. We use these datasets to devise detectors capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance. We then train two DRL agents, based on Double Deep Q-Network and Deep Sarsa, to generate realistic adversarial samples: the goal is achieving misclassifications by performing small modifications to the initial malicious samples. These alterations involve the features that can be more realistically altered by an expert attacker, and do not compromise the underlying malicious logic of the original samples. Our dataset represents an important contribution to the cybersecurity research community as it is the first including thousands of automatically generated adversarial samples that are able to thwart state of the art classifiers with a high evasion rate. The adversarial samples are grouped by malware variant and provided in a CSV file format. Researchers can validate their defensive proposals by testing their detectors against the adversarial samples of the proposed dataset. Moreover, the analysis of these samples can pave the way to a deeper comprehension of adversarial attacks and to some sort of explainability of machine learning defensive algorithms.

The increasing scale and sophistication of attacks, has prompted the need for a data driven solution, with machine learning forming the core of many cybersecurity systems. Machine learning was not designed with security in mind and the essential assumption of stationarity, requiring that the training and testing data follow similar distributions, is violated in an adversarial domain. In this paper, an adversary’s view point of a classification based system, is presented. Based on a formal adversarial model, the Seed-Explore-Exploit framework is presented, for simulating the generation of data driven and reverse engineering attacks on classifiers. Experimental evaluation, on 10 real world datasets and using the Google Cloud Prediction Platform, demonstrates the innate vulnerability of classifiers and the ease with which evasion can be carried out, without any explicit information about the classifier type, the training data or the application domain. The proposed framework, algorithms and empirical evaluation, serve as a white hat analysis of the vulnerabilities, and aim to foster the development of secure machine learning frameworks.}

Taking advantage of extended state observer, the attack signal is described as system disturbance and can be estimated. We propose two attack signal estimators, i.e., linear attack signal estimator (LASE) and nonlinear attack signal estimator (NASE). Through the analysis in the frequency domain, the influence of the attack signal frequency on the estimation performance of LASE is obtained.

To the best of our knowledge, existing attack methods cannot be applied to DT due to non-differentiation of its decision function. This is the first attack model designed for both DT and FDT. Our model quantifies the influence of changing a feature on the decision. The effectiveness of our method is compared with Papernot (PPNT) and Robustness Verification of Tree-based Models (RVTM), which are state-of-the-art attack methods for DT, and the attack methods employing surrogate and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) methods. The experimental results suggest that the fuzzifying process increases the robustness of DT. Moreover, FDT with more membership functions is more vulnerable since a smaller number of features is usually used.

We use the behavior of the rotating machine to propose new industrial intrusion detection for the control system of the rotating machine by machine learning techniques. The behavior is elicited by the data of sensors under all the conditions of the rotating machine operation. In this work, the nonlinear regression, novelty detection, outlier detection, and classification approaches are implemented to create behavioral model. On each implementation, online data are compared with the real data of behavior prediction model during the operation of the rotating machine to detect any abnormality. According to our experimental results, the accuracy of the behavioral models created by the One-classSVM novelty detection, k- Nearest Neighbor (kNN) outlier detection, decision tree classifier, k-Neighbors classifier, random forest classifier, and AdaBoost classifier is obtained as 0.98, 0.994, 0.999, 0.999, 0.999, and 0.999, respectively.

Indeed, contemporary machine learning algorithms have not been designed bearing in mind the adversarial nature of the environments they are deployed in. Thus, Machine Learning solutions are currently the target of a range of attacks. This paper evaluates the possibility of deteriorating the performance of a well-optimised intrusion detection algorithm at test time by crafting adversarial attacks with the four of the recently proposed methods and then offers a way to detect those attacks. The relevant background is provided for both artificial neural networks and four ways of crafting adversarial attacks. The new detection method is explained in detail, and the results of five different classifiers are compared. To the best of our knowledge, detecting adversarial attacks on artificial neural networks has not yet been widely researched in the context of intrusion detection systems.}

Daily reports of incidents appear in public media including major ex-filtrations of data for the purposes of stealing identities, credit card numbers, and intellectual property as well as to take control of network resources. Methods used by attackers constantly change in order to defeat techniques employed by information technology (IT) teams intended to discover or block intrusions. “Zero Day” attacks whose “signatures” are not yet in IT databases are continually being uncovered. Machine learning approaches have been widely used to increase the effectiveness of intrusion detection platforms. While some machine learning techniques are effective at detecting certain types of attacks, there are no known methods that can be applied universally and achieve consistent results for multiple attack types. The focus of our research is the development of a framework that combines the outputs of multiple learners in order to improve the efficacy of network intrusion on data that contains instances of multiple classes of attacks. We have chosen the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as the core learning algorithm due to recent research that suggests that ELMs are straightforward to implement, computationally efficient and have excellent learning performance characteristics on par with the Support Vector Machine (SVM), one of the most widely used and best performing machine learning platforms (Liu, Gao, & Li, 2012). We introduce the novel Multiple Adaptive Reduced Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (MARK-ELM) which combines Multiple Kernel Boosting (Xia & Hoi, 2013) with the Multiple Classification Reduced Kernel ELM (Deng, Zheng, & Zhang, 2013). We tested this approach on several machine learning datasets as well as the KDD Cup 99 (Hettich & Bay, 1999) intrusion detection dataset. Our results indicate that MARK-ELM works well for the majority of University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository small datasets and is scalable for larger datasets. For UCI datasets we achieved performance similar to the MKBoost Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach. In our experiments we demonstrate that MARK-ELM achieves superior detection rates and much lower false alarm rates than other approaches on intrusion detection data.}

It relied on building models of the normal/legitimate activities registered at the protected systems, from them analyzing the incoming observations looking for significant discordances that may reveal misbehaviors. But in the last years, the adversarial machine learning paradigm introduced never-seen-before evasion procedures able to jeopardize the traditional anomaly-based methods, thus entailing one of the major emerging challenges in the cybersecurity landscape. With the aim on contributing to their adaptation against adversarial threats, this paper presents EsPADA (Enhanced Payload Analyzer for malware Detection robust against Adversarial threats), a novel approach built on the grounds of the PAYL sensor family. At the SPARTA Training stage, both normal and adversarial models are constructed according to features extracted by N-gram, which are stored within Counting Bloom Filters (CBF). In this way it is possible to take advantage of both binary-based and spectral-based traffic modeling procedures for malware detection. At Detection stage, the payloads to be analyzed are collected from the protected environment and compared with the usage models previously built at Training. This leads to calculate different scores that allow to discriminate their nature (normal or suspicious) and to assess the labeling coherency, the latest studied for estimating the likelihood of the payload disguising mimicry attacks. The effectiveness of EsPADA was demonstrated on the public datasets DARPA’99 and UCM 2011 by achieving promising preliminarily results.}

In this work, we present a new intrusion detection algorithm with an excellent prediction performance. The prediction is based on a classifier which is a simple and extremely fast neural network. The classifier implements a policy function that is trained with a novel reinforcement learning model, where the behavior of the environment is adjusted in parallel with the learning process. Intrusion detection frameworks are based on a supervised learning paradigm that uses a training dataset composed of network features and associated intrusion labels. In this work, we integrate this paradigm with a reinforcement learning algorithm that is normally based on interaction with a live environment (not a pre-recorded dataset). To perform the integration, the live environment is replaced by a simulated one. The principle of this approach is to provide the simulated environment with an intelligent behavior by, first, generating new samples by randomly extracting them from the training dataset, generating rewards that depend on the goodness of the classifier's predictions, and, second, by further adjusting this initial behavior with an adversarial objective in which the environment will actively try to increase the difficulty of the prediction made by the classifier. In this way, the simulated environment acts as a second agent in an adversarial configuration against the original agent (the classifier). We prove that this architecture increases the final performance of the classifier. This work presents the first application of adversarial reinforcement learning for intrusion detection, and provides a novel technique that incorporates the environment's behavior into the learning process of a modified reinforcement learning algorithm. We prove that the proposed algorithm is adequate for a supervised learning problem based on a labeled dataset. We validate its performance by comparing it with other well-known machine learning models for two datasets. The proposed model outperforms the other models in the weighted Accuracy (>0.8) and F1 (>0.79) metrics, and especially excels in the results for the under-represented labels.}

For such purpose, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are one of the most important security mechanisms, which can help defend computer networks including IoT against various threats. In order to achieve better detection performance, collaborative intrusion detection systems or networks (CIDSs or CIDNs) are often adopted in a practical scenario, allowing a set of IDS nodes to exchange required information with each other, e.g., alarms, signatures. However, due to the distributed nature, such kind of collaborative network is vulnerable to insider attacks, i.e., malicious nodes can generate untruthful signatures and share to normal peers. This may cause intruders to be undetected and greatly degrade the effectiveness of IDSs. With the advent of blockchain technology, it provides a way to verify shared signatures (rules). In this work, our motivation is to develop CBSigIDS, a generic framework of collaborative blockchained signature-based IDSs, which can incrementally build and update a trusted signature database in a collaborative IoT environment. CBSigIDS can provide a verifiable manner in distributed architectures without the need of a trusted intermediary. In the evaluation, our results demonstrate that CBSigIDS can enhance the robustness and effectiveness of signature-based IDSs under adversarial scenarios.}

For physical system-relevant perceptual executive layer, potential and covert attacks are detected by the clustered sensory system state residual anomaly monitoring based on a process noise and measurement noise-adaptive Kalman filter (PNMN-AKF). PNMN-AKF can perform a joint recursive estimation of dynamic system states, time-varying process and measurement noise covariance matrices by the variational Bayes approximation framework. In cyberspace, potential cyber-attacks are detected by the anomaly monitoring of the statistical distribution of the network transmission characteristics of data transmission layer by introducing a forgetting factor-induced recursive Gaussian mixture model (FF-RGMM). In the application control layer, a regularized sparse deep belief network model is introduced to characterize the misuse behavior for detecting potential attacks. Extensive validation and comparative experiments have been conducted on a numerical simulation system and a comprehensive ICPS simulation platform by using OPNET and a commonly-used benchmark simplified Tennessee Eastman process (STEP) based on Matlab/Simulink. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hierarchically distributed intrusion detection method can efficiently recognize potential and covert cyber-attacks in each ICPSs link with low false alarm rate and missing detection rate, which lays a foundation for the overall security monitoring of ICPSs.}

abstract = {In this paper, the stealthy attack detection in industrial control system (ICS) is studied, and a new detection method is proposed from the perspective of signal analysis. The method consists of a double-layer one-class support vector machine model (DL-OCSVM), where the first-layer model is the standard OCSVM, and the second-layer model is obtained by incremental learning based on the former. The wavelet decomposition is used to extract the physical characteristics of the ICS. The KKT condition and the adjacent classification interval are adopted to reduce the training samples, improving the learning rate and system scalability. In addition, the designed boundary samples are employed for incremental learning, avoiding overfitting and reducing false positives rate (FPR). The experimental results show that the proposed method has high detection rate and low FPR for stealthy attacks, and is more suitable for precision machining process.}

In our paper, we presented an artificially full-automated intrusion detection system for Fog security against cyber-attacks. The proposed model uses multi-layered of recurrent neural networks designed to be implemented for Fog computing security that is very close to the end-users and IoT devices.

Vehicle network security is an urgent and significant problem because the malfunctioning of vehicles can directly affect human and road safety. The controller area network (CAN), which is used as a de facto standard for in-vehicle networks, does not have sufficient security features, such as message encryption and sender authentication, to protect the network from cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system (IDS) based on a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to protect the CAN bus of the vehicle. The DCNN learns the network traffic patterns and detects malicious traffic without hand-designed features. We designed the DCNN model, which was optimized for the data traffic of the CAN bus, to achieve high detection performance while reducing the unnecessary complexity in the architecture of the Inception-ResNet model. We performed an experimental study using the datasets we built with a real vehicle to evaluate our detection system. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed IDS has significantly low false negative rates and error rates when compared to the conventional machine-learning algorithms.}

A test bed is build to simulate the IoT environment using Node MCU ESP8266, DHT11 sensor and wireless router. An adversarial system is build using a laptop system which performs actions of sniffing and poisoning attacks. Data captured from the sensors were temperature, humidity and due-point which are transmitted to ThinkSpeak platform using wireless gateway. In the normal phase, sensor values is captured by Node MCU and transmitted to Think Speak server which are stored and labelled as normal data. In the attacking phase, from an adversarial system, the attacker secretly intercepts the data, modifies the data when it is transmitted between the Node MCU and Think Speak server. In the attacking phase, Man in the Middle attack is performed in the network using ARP Poisoning and the data captured is labelled as attack data.

Network intrusion detection (NID) has attracted more and more attention from industrial and academic fields. Over the years, researchers have developed artificial intelligence methods to tackle them. However, most existing methods are usually not feasible and sustainable when faced with the demands of current NID systems. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) named RANet for NID automatically. In RANet, we not only introduce a Group-Gating module but also apply the overlapping method to the last max-pooling layer. Based on the hyper-parameter settings of our RANet, a lot of performance comparison experiments are conducted. The results demonstrate that RANet achieves better NID performance than strong baselines and existing state-of-the-art methods on five publicly available NID benchmarks. For example, the RANet improves accuracy with approximately 5.3% on NSL-KDD Test−21 dataset through comparisons to state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, the results of RANet also indicate that it has the great potential or use in current NID systems.}

A technology to store and maintain user's information that is mostly used for its simplicity and low-cost services is cloud computing (CC). Also, a new model of computing that is noteworthy today is mobile cloud computing (MCC) that is used to reduce the limitations of mobile devices by allowing them to offload certain computations to the remote cloud. The cloud environment may consist of critical or essential information of an organization; therefore, to prevent this environment from possible attacks a security solution is needed. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a solution to these security issues. An IDS is a hardware or software device that can examine all inside and outside network activities and recognize doubtful patterns that may demonstrate a network attack and automatically alert the network (or system) administrator. Because of the ability of an IDS to detect known/unknown (inside/outside) attacks, it is an excellent choice for securing cloud computing. Various methods are used in an intrusion detection system to recognize attacks more accurately. Unlike survey papers presented so far, this paper aims to present a comprehensive survey of intrusion detection systems that use computational intelligence (CI) methods in a (mobile) cloud environment. We firstly provide an overview of CC and MCC paradigms and service models, also reviewing security threats in these contexts. Previous literature is critically surveyed, highlighting the advantages and limitations of previous work. Then we define a taxonomy for IDS and classify CI-based techniques into single and hybrid methods. Finally, we highlight open issues and future directions for research on this topic.}

In the IoV, frequent data transmission and complex connections among numerous different nodes increase the complexity and diversity of malicious attacks. In order to realize the accurate and rapid detection of malicious attacks in the IoV environment, in this paper, an intrusion detection method is proposed by combining oversampling, outlier detection and metric learning. The proposed approach improves intrusion detection effect in three main ways: 1) it oversamples the minority classes based on a novel strategy, 2) it introduces a new feature with basis of imbalance ratio, and 3) it reduces the outliers and rescales original samples actively to make the decision boundary clearer by combining outlier detection and distance metric learning. Furthermore, genetic algorithm is used to extract the optimal subset of features. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve 98.51% accuracy and maintain 0.82% false alarm rate on UNSW-NB15 dataset. Also, it outperforms the existing methods on ROAD, Car-Hacking and CAN-intrusion dataset for in-vehicle communications.}

The increasing interaction between ICS and the outside IT world, however, has made them an attractive target for a variety of cyber attacks, raising great need to secure the ICS. In ICS, skilled attackers can manipulate sensor readings or control signals until the system crashes, while still keeping the attack process hidden by closely following the expected behavior of the system. This kind of attacks is called stealthy attacks, which cannot be detected by traditional intrusion detection methods in which only the magnitudes of residuals are evaluated. In this paper, we show that the residuals generated during a stealthy attack present some sort of regularity besides the magnitudes. Based on this observation, we propose a novel permutation entropy-based approach to detect stealthy attacks on ICS. The permutation entropy can characterize the non-randomness contained in the residuals so as to distinguish the residuals during a stealthy attack from a random series effectively. A significant change of the permutation entropy indicates the occurrence of a stealthy attack. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed stealthy attack detection approach.}

A number of studies have been conducted on how to achieve a FANET, but few have considered the security perspectives of this subject. FANET’s unique features have made it difficult to strengthen its defense against ever-changing security threats. Today, more and more FANET applications are implemented into civil airspace, but the development of FANET security has remained unsatisfactory. In this paper, we try to address this issue by proposing a new Intrusion Detection System (IDS), an hybrid method based on both spectral traffic analysis and a robust controller / observer for anomaly estimation inside UAV networks. The proposed hybrid method considers, as a preliminary step, a statistical signature of the traffic exchanged in the network. By examining the resulted signatures, the differences are used to select the accurate model for accurate estimation of that abnormal traffic. The proposed IDS design has been successfully applied to some relevant practical problems such as ad hoc networks for aerial vehicles, and the effectiveness is illustrated by using real traffic traces including Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Our first results show promising perspectives for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in UAV communication networks. Indeed, different types of anomaly have been considered and they are all accurately detected by the intrusion detection process we propose in this paper. Finally, both simulation-based validation and real-time real-world based implementation of our IDS are described in this article.}

We focus on the attack perspective, which includes techniques to generate adversarial examples capable of evading a variety of machine learning models. More specifically, we explore the use of evolutionary computation (particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm) and deep learning (generative adversarial networks) as tools for adversarial example generation. To assess the performance of these algorithms in evading a NIDS, we apply them to two publicly available data sets, namely the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15, and we contrast them to a baseline perturbation method: Monte Carlo simulation.

Researchers in industry and academia have been proposing methods and building systems for detecting and preventing such security breaches for more than four decades. Solutions proposed for dealing with network intrusions can be broadly classified as signature-based and anomaly-based. Signature-based intrusion detection systems look for patterns that match known attacks. On the other hand, anomaly-based intrusion detection systems develop a model for distinguishing legitimate users’ behavior from that of malicious users’ and hence are capable of detecting unknown attacks. One of the approaches used to classify legitimate and anomalous behavior is to use Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Several intrusion detection systems based on ML techniques have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we present a comprehensive critical survey of ML-based intrusion detection approaches presented in the literature in the last ten years. This survey would serve as a supplement to other general surveys on intrusion detection as well as a reference to recent work done in the area for researchers working in ML-based intrusion detection systems.

Intrusion detection system (IDS) is one of the effective methods for protecting network. With the rise of artificial intelligence technology, intrusion detection system based on ML/DL is widely applied. However, neural network is vulnerable to adversarial perturbation. Most of existing adversarial attacks cannot guarantee the basic function of traffic data. In this paper, we propose an improved adversarial attack model based on Generated Adversarial Network called attackGAN, and design a new loss function to achieve effective attack against the black-box intrusion detection system on the premise of ensuring network traffic functionality. Experiments show that the proposed attackGAN can improve the success rate of adversarial attack against the black-box IDS compared with Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Project Gradient Descent (PGD), CW attack (CW) and the GAN-based algorithms.}

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSes) are integrated into security-critical infrastructures such as medical devices, autonomous vehicles and smart grids. Unfortunately, the pervasiveness and network accessibility of these systems and their relative lack of security measures make them attractive targets for attacks. This makes building Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for CPSes a necessity. However, detecting intrusions requires collecting information about a system’s internal workings; this can be expensive both in runtime and memory consumption. According to prior research, fine-grain monitoring of a CPS maximizes the chance of intrusion detection but incurs overhead that can exceed the resource constraints of these systems. The objective of this study is to propose a solution for adapting IDSes for deployment on resource-limited CPSes without losing detection accuracy. We propose ARTINALI#; a Bayesian-based search and score technique that identifies the critical points at which to instrument a CPS. Given a set of security monitors that observe run-time behavior of the system, a set of specifications that verify the correct behavior of the system, and statistics gathered from fault injection, ARTINALI# discovers a small set of locations and a rich set of specifications that yield full attack coverage with low (memory and time) overhead. We deploy ARTINALI# to construct an IDS for two CPSes: a smart meter and a smart artificial pancreas. We demonstrate that our technique reduces the number of security monitors by 64% on average, leading to 52% and 69% reductions in memory and runtime overhead respectively, while still detecting over 98% of emulated attacks, on average. ARTINALI# enables the IDSes to be applicable to a wide range of CPS systems with different resource capacities. In addition, it accelerates the attack detection process which is significantly essential for safety-critical systems.}

abstract = {The intrusion detection field has been increasing the adoption of newer datasets after relying mainly on KDD99 and NSL-KDD. Both the height and the width of the newer datasets have increased substantially since they are geared towards evaluation by machine learning methods. The feature sets however are most often statistics, derived either from the packets, or more commonly from the (reconstructed) flows. The ease with which connected clusters of features can be extracted as well as the tendency to be overinclusive to provide researchers with as much data as possible has introduced significant bloat in the datasets. In order to improve the effective and efficient use of the datasets, this article proposes a hybrid feature selection mechanism based on a first-pass filter method and a second-pass embedded method with a central role for statistical testing to identify hierarchies of dominant feature sets. The non-destructive approach allows for the hierarchies to be inspected, interpreted and related to each other. The proposed approach is validated by constructing the feature hierarchies at three different resolutions for all recent datasets published by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (IDS2017, DoS2017, IDS2018 and DDoS2019, millions of samples, 76 features). Three standard supervised learners were given increasing access to the feature (blocks) in terms of their hierarchical position. The results show that attack classes with a clear network component can be detected with cross-validated balanced accuracy, precision and recall above 99%, even when the classification model has been built from just 1 to 4 features, while additionally under a very restrictive sampling regimen: training (0.8%), validation (0.2%) and testing (99%). When selecting models only for classification performance more attack classes are detected more reliably, and while this increases feature use to an average of 12, this is still preferable over using the datasets’ standard set of 76 features.}

Most existing machine learning-based IDSs learn patterns from the features extracted from network traffic flows, and the deep learning-based approaches can learn data distribution features from the raw data to differentiate normal and anomalous network flows. Although having been used in the real world widely, the above methods are vulnerable to some types of attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework, Anti-Intrusion Detection AutoEncoder (AIDAE), to generate features to disable the IDS. In the proposed framework, an encoder transforms features into a latent space, and multiple decoders reconstruct the continuous and discrete features, respectively. Additionally, a generative adversarial network is used to learn the flexible prior distribution of the latent space. The correlation between continuous and discrete features can be kept by using the proposed training scheme. Experiments conducted on NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS2017 datasets show that the generated features indeed degrade the detection performance of existing IDSs dramatically.}

abstract = {The proliferation and application of machine learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have allowed for more flexibility and efficiency in the automated detection of cyber attacks in Industrial Control Systems (ICS). However, the introduction of such IDSs has also created an additional attack vector; the learning models may also be subject to cyber attacks, otherwise referred to as Adversarial Machine Learning (AML). Such attacks may have severe consequences in ICS systems, as adversaries could potentially bypass the IDS. This could lead to delayed attack detection which may result in infrastructure damages, financial loss, and even loss of life. This paper explores how adversarial learning can be used to target supervised models by generating adversarial samples using the Jacobian-based Saliency Map attack and exploring classification behaviours. The analysis also includes the exploration of how such samples can support the robustness of supervised models using adversarial training. An authentic power system dataset was used to support the experiments presented herein. Overall, the classification performance of two widely used classifiers, Random Forest and J48, decreased by 6 and 11 percentage points when adversarial samples were present. Their performances improved following adversarial training, demonstrating their robustness towards such attacks.}

These attacks impose a greater risk on network services that are increasingly important from a social end economical point of view. In this work we present a novel application of several deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to intrusion detection using a labeled dataset. We present how to perform supervised learning based on a DRL framework. The implementation of a reward function aligned with the detection of intrusions is extremely difficult for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) since there is no automatic way to identify intrusions. Usually the identification is performed manually and stored in datasets of network features associated with intrusion events. These datasets are used to train supervised machine learning algorithms for classifying intrusion events. In this paper we apply DRL using two of these datasets: NSL-KDD and AWID datasets. As a novel approach, we have made a conceptual modification of the classic DRL paradigm (based on interaction with a live environment), replacing the environment with a sampling function of recorded training intrusions. This new pseudo-environment, in addition to sampling the training dataset, generates rewards based on detection errors found during training. We present the results of applying our technique to four of the most relevant DRL models: Deep Q-Network (DQN), Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), Policy Gradient (PG) and Actor-Critic (AC). The best results are obtained for the DDQN algorithm. We show that DRL, with our model and some parameter adjustments, can improve the results of intrusion detection in comparison with current machine learning techniques. Besides, the classifier obtained with DRL is faster than alternative models. A comprehensive comparison of the results obtained with other machine learning models is provided for the AWID and NSL-KDD datasets, together with the lessons learned from the application of several design alternatives to the four DRL models.}

Recently proposed adversarial examples-slightly modified data that lead to incorrect classification-are a severe threat to the security of DNNs. In some situations, however, an adversarial example might be useful, such as when deceiving an enemy classifier on the battlefield. In such a scenario, it is necessary that a friendly classifier not be deceived. In this paper, we propose a friend-safe adversarial example, meaning that the friendly machine can classify the adversarial example correctly. To produce such examples, a transformation is carried out to minimize the probability of incorrect classification by the friend and that of correct classification by the adversary. We suggest two configurations for the scheme: targeted and untargeted class attacks. We performed experiments with this scheme using the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. Our proposed method shows a 100% attack success rate and 100% friend accuracy with only a small distortion: 2.18 and 1.54 for the two respective MNIST configurations, and 49.02 and 27.61 for the two respective CIFAR10 configurations. Additionally, we propose a new covert channel scheme and a mixed battlefield application for consideration in further applications.}

When associating with Software-Defined Networks (SDN), the deployment of IDSs can leverage the centralized control plane in SDN to support for large-scale network monitoring. However, machine learning-based IDSs themselves can be attacked and tricked by adversarial examples with additional perturbation from the original ones. It is vital to provide supplementary unknown traffic to evaluate and improve the resilience of IDS against variants of cyberattacks. Thus, this work explores the method of generating adversarial attack samples by Generative Adversarial Model (GAN) to deceive IDS. We propose DIGFuPAS, a framework can create attack samples which can bypass machine learning-based IDSs in SDN with the black-box manner. In this framework, instead of Vanilla GAN, we use Wassertein GAN (WGAN) to improve the ability of GAN convergence training. In addition, the strategy of preserving functional features of attack traffic is applied to maintain the operational aspect of adversarial attacks. Through our implementation and experiments on NSL-KDD and CICIDS2018 dataset, the decreased detection rate of black-box IDSs on adversarial attacks demonstrates that our proposed framework can make IDSs in SDN-enabled networks misclassify on GAN-based synthetic attacks. Also, we utilize DIGFuPAS as a tool for evaluating and improving the robustness of IDS by repetitively retraining classifiers from crafted network traffic flow.}

In our previous research, we developed a notion of intrusion sensitivity and identified that it can help improve the detection of insider attacks, whereas it is still a challenge for these nodes to automatically assign the values. In this article, we therefore aim to design an intrusion sensitivity-based trust management model that allows each IDS to evaluate the trustworthiness of others by considering their detection sensitivities, and further develop a supervised approach, which employs machine learning techniques to automatically assign the values of intrusion sensitivity based on expert knowledge. In the evaluation, we compare the performance of three different supervised classifiers in assigning sensitivity values and investigate our trust model under different attack scenarios and in a real wireless sensor network.

abstract = {In recent years, we have witnessed the proliferation of mobile devices such as smart phones, tablets, smart watches, etc., the majority of which are based on the Android operating system. However, because these Android-based mobile devices are becoming increasingly popular, they are now the primary target of mobile malware, which could cause both privacy leakage and property loss. To address the rapidly deteriorating security issues caused by mobile malware, various research efforts have been made to develop novel and effective detection mechanisms to identify and battle them. Nevertheless, in order to avoid being caught by these malware detection mechanisms, malware authors are inclined to launch adversarial example attacks by tampering with mobile applications. In this paper, several types of adversarial example attacks are investigated and a feasible approach is proposed to fight against them. First, we look at adversarial example attacks on the Android system and prior solutions that have been proposed to address these attacks. Then, we specifically focus on the data poisoning attack and evasion attack models, which may mutate various application features, such as API calls, permissions and the class label, to produce adversarial examples. Then, we propose and design a malware detection approach which is resistant to the adversarial examples. To observe and investigate how the malware detection system is impacted by the adversarial example attacks, we conduct experiments on some real Android application datasets which are composed of both malware and benign applications. Experimental results clearly indicate that the performance of Android malware detection is severely degraded when facing the adversarial example attacks.}

In recent years, blockchain technology has got a lot of attention as a way to share data without the need for a trusted third party. In particular, data recorded in a single block cannot be modified without impacting all subsequent blocks. For an effective update, an attacker will need to monitor the majority of network nodes, which is not feasible given the current network size. This work aims to create a deep learning-based IDS model with the potential of integrating blockchain technology with intrusion detection, inspired by the ability to apply blockchain in all fields. The proposed model outperforms the conventional systems with respect to accuracy in detecting the security attacks.}

However, this has also created an additional attack vector; the machine learning models which support the IDS’s decisions may also be subject to cyberattacks known as Adversarial Machine Learning (AML). In the context of IoT, AML can be used to manipulate data and network traffic that traverse through such devices. These perturbations increase the confusion in the decision boundaries of the machine learning classifier, where malicious network packets are often miss-classified as being benign. Consequently, such errors are bypassed by machine learning based detectors, which increases the potential of significantly delaying attack detection and further consequences such as personal information leakage, damaged hardware, and financial loss. Given the impact that these attacks may have, this paper proposes a rule-based approach towards generating AML attack samples and explores how they can be used to target a range of supervised machine learning classifiers used for detecting Denial of Service attacks in an IoT smart home network. The analysis explores which DoS packet features to perturb and how such adversarial samples can support increasing the robustness of supervised models using adversarial training. The results demonstrated that the performance of all the top performing classifiers were affected, decreasing a maximum of 47.2 percentage points when adversarial samples were present. Their performances improved following adversarial training, demonstrating their robustness towards such attacks.}

The datasets used in intrusion detection systems contain many features. It is, therefore, necessary to apply a feature selection step to improve the classification performance and reduce the computation time. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective feature selection approach based on NSGA-II and logistic regression in network intrusion detection. The proposed wrapper approach is tested according to two schemes: the first uses binomial logistic regression with many binary-class datasets corresponding to each type of attack, and the second uses multinomial logistic regression with a multi-class dataset. The best obtained subsets are tested using three different decision tree classifiers namely C4.5 decision tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes Tree. Three datasets are used in experiments namely NSL-KDD dataset, UNSW-NB15 dataset, and CIC-IDS2017. The obtained results show better accuracy when using binary-class datasets compared to multi-class datasets. Furthermore, the two schemes for feature selection succeed in reducing the features space by removing irrelevant features and keeping only the most informative ones. The obtained results are promising compared to other approaches.}

Additionally, we present a compilation of the detection rules deployed by the state-of-art IDSs and assess their resiliency to five types of attacks.

With the burgeoning of inference mechanism, inference-based methods show the promising performance. However, inference-based methods have two limitations: (1) they use an adversarial training way to learn data features. Such training way fails to learn task-specific features which can be conducive to capture the difference between normal and anomaly data. (2) The structure of detection network cannot capture the marginal distributions of normal data and corresponding features, which influences on the performance of anomaly detection. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a deep adversarial anomaly detection (DAAD) method. Specifically, an auxiliary task with self-supervised learning is first designed to learn task-specific features. Then a deep adversarial training (DAT) model is constructed to capture marginal distributions of normal data in different spaces. In addition, a majority voting strategy is applied to obtain reliable detection results. Experimental results on image and sequence datasets show that proposed method performs significantly better than many strong baselines.}

However, the underlying resource constraints and ad hoc nature of such systems have significant implications especially in achieving effective intrusion detection. Consequently, contemporary solutions requiring a stable infrastructure and extensive computational resources are inadequate to fulfill these characteristics of an IIoT system. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection framework for the energy-constrained IoT devices which form the foundation of an IIoT ecosystem. In view of the ad hoc nature of such systems as well as emerging complex threats such as botnets, we assess the feasibility of collaboration between the host (IoT devices) and the edge devices for effective intrusion detection whilst minimizing energy consumption and communication overhead.

However, it is still necessary to dedicate effort towards investigating protection mechanisms against cyberattacks in these scenarios. Despite the power demonstrated by Anomaly Detection-based Intrusion Detection Systems in industrial scenarios, their vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, especially to evasion attacks, make Machine Learning and Deep Learning models ineffective for real scenarios. These type of attacks craft samples misclassified by the Intrusion Detection System and potentially reach industrial devices, causing potentially damaging impacts to factory workers and industry resources. Adversarial attacks linked to industrial scenarios are currently in early stages of development, hence most of them have the capability to craft samples misclassified by the IDS but not reach industrial devices. In this work, we present a new adversarial attack named Selective and Iterative Gradient Sign Method that overcomes the limitation of the adversarial attacks present in the literature. To complement this work we also detail a study of how the detection rate of an Intrusion Detection System is degraded and the time required by each technique to generate adversarial samples. The experiments were carried out using a dataset named Electra, collected from an Electric Traction Substation, and showed that adversarial attacks evaluated crafted samples misclassified by the IDS. However, only the method we proposed generated samples that can be understood by intermediate network devices and, therefore, reach their destination. Our experiment outputs demonstrate a lower period of time to achieve and craft adversarial samples using out our iterative based process method as opposed to other current iterative methods currently available.}

In addition, among the machine learning steps, data preprocessing, being highly critical in the data analysis process, appears to be the least researched in the context of Network Intrusion Detection, namely in code injection. The goal of this survey is to fill in the gap through analysing and classifying the existing machine learning techniques applied to the code injection attack detection, with special attention to Deep Learning. Our analysis reveals that the way the input data is preprocessed considerably impacts the performance and attack detection rate. The proposed full preprocessing cycle demonstrates how various machine-learning-based approaches for detection of code injection attacks take advantage of different input data preprocessing techniques. The most used machine learning methods and preprocessing stages have been also identified.}

abstract = {With the emergence of ever-advancing network threats, the guarantee of system security becomes increasingly crucial, especially in the dynamic and decentralized ad-hoc networks. One essential part of cybersecurity is intrusion detection, which identifies anomalous activities according to traffic patterns. However, the class-imbalanced data have caused a challenging problem where the number of abnormal samples is significantly lower than that of the normal ones. This class imbalance problem confines the performance of intrusion classifiers and results in low robustness to unknown anomalies. In this paper, we propose a novel Imbalanced Generative Adversarial Network (IGAN) to tackle the class imbalance problem. In the primary novelty of our model, we introduce an imbalanced data filter and convolutional layers to the typical GAN, generating new representative instances for minority classes. Further, an IGAN-based Intrusion Detection System, namely IGAN-IDS, is established to cope with class-imbalanced intrusion detection, using the instances generated by IGAN. Concretely, IGAN-IDS consists of three modules: feature extraction, IGAN, and deep neural network. First, we utilize a feed-forward neural network (FNN) to transform raw network attributes into feature vectors. Then, the IGAN generates new samples expressed in the latent space. Finally, the deep neural network, composed of convolutional layers and fully-connected layers, executes the final intrusion detection. We conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of IGAN-IDS, comparing against 15 other methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed IGAN-IDS outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.}

Furthermore, communication with various external networks—such as cloud, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication networks—further reinforces the connectivity between the inside and outside of a vehicle. On the contrary, this means that the functions of existing vehicles using computer-assisted mechanical mechanisms can be manipulated and controlled by a malicious packet attack. Therefore, diversified and advanced architectures of vehicle systems can significantly increase the accessibility of the system to hackers and the possibility of an attack. This paper proposes an intrusion detection method for vehicular networks based on the survival analysis model. Our main aims were to identify malicious CAN messages and accurately detect the normality and abnormality of a vehicle network without semantic knowledge of the CAN ID function. To this end, normal and abnormal driving data were extracted from three different types of vehicles and we evaluated the performance of our proposed method by measuring the accuracy and the time complexity of anomaly detection by considering three attack scenarios and the periodic characteristics of CAN IDs. Based on the results, we concluded that a CAN ID with a long cycle affects the detection accuracy and the number of CAN IDs affects the detection speed. The difference in the detection accuracy between applying all CAN IDs and CAN IDs with a short cycle is not considerable with some differences observed in the detection accuracy depending on the chunk size and the specific attack type. High detection accuracy and low computational cost will be the essential factors for real-time processing of IVN security. Taken together, the results of the present study contribute to the current understanding of how to correctly manage vehicle communications for vehicle security and driver safety.}

This paper mainly proposes an intrusion detection algorithm based on improved AdaBoost-RBFSVM, and designs an intrusion detection system (IDS) for WSNs denial of service (DoS) attack based on the proposed method. In order to make the RBF-SVM algorithm as the AdaBoost weak classifier, the effect of training is achieved. Using the influence of parameter σ to RBF-SVM and the effect of model training error em on the smoothness of AdaBoost weights, the IABRBFSVM algorithm is proposed. On the other hand, after analyzing the DoS attack, the eigenspace for the attack is proposed, and the corresponding intrusion detection system is designed. Through simulation, the proposed IDS can significantly improve the network performance by detecting and removing malicious nodes in the network, from the perspective of detection rate, packet delivery rate, transmission delay and energy consumption analysis, and has the characteristics of simple structure, short computation time and high detection rate.}

These threats, as examples of zero-day attacks, are able to change their behavior several times in the early phases of their existence to bypass the network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). In fact, even well-designed, and frequently-updated signature-based NIDS cannot detect the zero-day treats due to the lack of an adequate signature database, adaptive to intelligent attacks on the Internet. More importantly, having an NIDS, it should be tested on malicious traffic dataset that not only represents known attacks, but also can to some extent reflect the characteristics of unknown, zero-day attacks. Generating such traffic is identified in the literature as one of the main obstacles for evaluating the effectiveness of NIDS. To address these issues, we introduce RNNIDS that applies Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to find complex patterns in attacks and generate similar ones. In this regard, for the first time, we demonstrate that RNNs are helpful to generate new, unseen mutants of attacks as well as synthetic signatures from the most advanced malware to improve the intrusion detection rate. Besides, to further enhance the design of an NIDS, RNNs can be employed to generate malicious datasets containing, e.g., unseen mutants of a malware. To evaluate the feasibility of our approaches, we conduct extensive experiments by incorporating publicly available datasets, where we show a considerable improvement in the detection rate of an off-the-shelf NIDS (up to 16.67%).}

Deep-learning models provide a solution as they can reduce the dimensionality of massive data, extract data features, and identify intrusions. However, the network structure and the number of hidden layer neurons of deep-learning models are determined by empirical or trial-and-error methods, which will affect the generalization ability and learning efficiency of the model. In the present work, a deep belief network model based on information entropy (IE-DBN model) is proposed for network intrusion detection. The model uses information gain (IG) to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data features and remove redundant features. The information entropy is used to determine the number of hidden neurons in the DBN network and the network depth. The synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) algorithm is used to address the problem of data imbalance. Tests on the KDD CUP 99 intrusion detection data set have shown that the proposed IE-DBN model improved the convergence speed of the model and reduced the likelihood of overfitting. Compared with the conventional back propagation (BP) neural network and DBN network model, the IE-DBN model obtained a higher detection accuracy and a lower false alarm rate. Verification tests on other intrusion detection data sets showed that the proposed IE-DBN model had good generalization capacity.}

So, this paper focuses on studying the complex value neural network (CVNN) to detect arbitration field (CAN ID) for protecting CAN network. We proposed an encoder, which can extract shallow features via the auto-encoder algorithm, and furthermore present a random phase that rotates the complex-valued domain features to hide the real features. Then the proposed processing model extracts valuable features with an attention mechanism. Injecting anomaly data in the real vehicle to build the CAN dataset, the real-time detection shows that constructed IDS present a high resulting accuracy, achieving 98%.

At present, SDN may face many challenges like insider attacks, i.e., the centralized control plane would be attacked by malicious underlying devices and switches. To protect the security of SDN, effective detection approaches are indispensable. In the literature, challenge-based Collaborative Intrusion Detection Networks (CIDNs) are an effective detection framework in identifying malicious nodes. It calculates the nodes’ reputation and detects a malicious node by sending out a special message called a challenge. In this work, we devise a challenge-based CIDN in SDN and measure its performance against malicious internal nodes. Our results demonstrate that such a mechanism can be effective in SDN environments.}

In this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection approach for the IoT, through the adoption of a customised deep learning technique. We utilise a cutting-edge IoT dataset comprising IoT traces and realistic attack traffic, including denial of service, distributed denial of service, data gathering and data theft attacks. A feed-forward neural networks model with embedding layers (to encode high-dimensional categorical features) for multi-class classification, is developed. The concept of transfer learning is subsequently applied to encode high-dimensional categorical features to build a binary classifier based on a second feed-forward neural networks model. We obtain results through the evaluation of the proposed approach which demonstrate a high classification accuracy for both classifiers, namely, binary and multi-class.}

OPFC interprets a dataset as a graph, whose nodes are the samples and each sample is connected to its k-nearest neighbors in a given feature space (a k-nn graph). The nodes of the graph are weighted by their pdf values and the pdf is computed based on the distances between the samples and their k-nearest neighbors. Once the k-nn graph is defined, OPFC finds one sample (root) at each maximum of the pdf and propagates one optimum-path tree (cluster) from each root to the remaining samples of its dome. Clustering effectiveness will depend on the pdf estimation, and the proposed approach efficiently computes the best value of k for a given application. We validate our approach in the context of intrusion detection in computer networks. First, we compare OPFC with data clustering based on k-means, and self-organization maps. Second, we evaluate several metaheuristic techniques to find the best value of k.}

The Controller Area Network (CAN) enables communication between components core to the car’s safety and performance, and has been demonstrated to be particularly vulnerable to hacking and malicious cyber-intrusion. CAN intrusion detection systems have been envisaged. Signatures of known attacks might be used for detection, but this method holds many limitations. Although some attacks might change packet broadcast rates or add unknown packets onto the network, attacks that have little or no effect on these, yet can alter the packet data, have also been devised. We therefore test three novelty detection methods (Local Outlier Factor, Compound Classifier and One-Class Support Vector Machine) that might identify an attack based solely on anomalies in CAN packet field data-values. The methods compare values across a cluster of CAN packets broadcast from different control units, so potentially could identify an attacked control unit even when its subsequent fabricated payload data-values remain plausible. We test the methods on data from two different makes of car across a range of manipulation magnitudes, reflecting the unpredictability of attacks. Different training regimes are tested, enabling us to assess validity across journeys. We also consider the processes needed to determine the CAN fields that might be included in the intrusion detection cluster, and present algorithms for automating those processes.}

Moreover, the pattern of network traffic, especially in cellular networks, shows very complex behavior because of various factors, such as device mobility and network heterogeneity. Deep learning has been efficiently employed to facilitate analytics and knowledge discovery in big data systems to recognize hidden and complex patterns. Motivated by these successes, researchers in the field of networking apply deep learning models for Network Traffic Monitoring and Analysis (NTMA) applications, e.g., traffic classification and prediction.

But these sensors and communication links have great security and safety concerns as they can be attacked by an adversary to take the control of an autonomous vehicle by influencing their data. Especially during the state estimation process for monitoring of autonomous vehicles' dynamics system, these concerns require immediate and effective solution. In this paper we present a new adversarial deep reinforcement learning algorithm (NDRL) that can be used to maximize the robustness of autonomous vehicle dynamics in the presence of these attacks. In this approach the adversary tries to insert defective data to the autonomous vehicle's sensor readings so that it can disrupt the safe and optimal distance between the autonomous vehicles traveling on the road. The attacker tries to make sure that there is no more safe and optimal distance between the autonomous vehicles, thus it may lead to the road accidents. Further attacker can also add fake data in such a way that it leads to reduced traffic flow on the road. On the other hand, autonomous vehicle will try to defend itself from these types of attacks by maintaining the safe and optimal distance i.e. by minimizing the deviation so that adversary does not succeed in its mission. This attacker-autonomous vehicle action reaction can be studied through the game theory formulation with incorporating the deep learning tools. Each autonomous vehicle will use Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM)-Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models to find out the anticipated distance variation resulting from its actions and input this to the new deep reinforcement learning algorithm (NDRL) which attempts to reduce the variation in distance. Whereas attacker also chooses deep reinforcement learning algorithm (NDRL) and wants to maximize the distance variation between the autonomous vehicles.}

To detect this threat effectively, several machine learning (ML)-based methods have been developed in the past few years. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of these advances. The paper starts by providing a brief overview of SG architecture and its data sources. Moreover, the categories of false data attacks followed by data security requirements are introduced. Then, the recent ML-based detection techniques are summarized by grouping them into three major detection scenarios: non-technical losses, state estimation, and load forecasting.

Multi-stage attack plan recognition aims at inferring attack plans and predicting upcoming attacks by analyzing the causal relationship between attack phases. Recent research often uses machine learning to deal with attack issues. However, some problems still exist. When probabilistic inference is applied to construct a causal network, researchers fail to take temporal sequence association into consideration, which makes it difficult for the model to deal with incomplete data. While the hidden Markov model can be used to recognize an attack plan, it cannot predict multiple intents nor their probabilities. This paper proposes a probability model based on the hidden Markov model and probabilistic inference responding to malicious events at runtime. This model uses online parameter updating rules which make it better suited to the rapidly changing cyber environment. Experimental results show that this model can achieve better performance compared to only using a single method and detect attack intent in an earlier stage.}

The majority of open-source host-based analytics are heuristic in nature and often rely on matching combinations of strings to produce an alert. Recent threat reports demonstrate that threat actors are able to easily evade these types of analytics via variances in attack techniques, implementation differences, or simple string/parameter modifications. This work introduces a novel machine learning-based approach (procmonML) to generate true behavioral host-based analytics that are more resilient to adversary evasion, thus imparting more workload on the adversary to successfully evade detection. This is accomplished by consolidating multiple system events into a single process event. Analytics are generated from a tree ensemble model using labeled host data from a lab environment and are validated on production enterprise endpoints. This approach can detect multiple variations of a single attack technique by capturing and generalizing system behaviors. The results demonstrate that the procmonML approach is able to effectively generate host-based analytics that are applicable to new environments and more resilient to adversary evasion.}

While blockchain facilitates the data collection that is critical for machine learning under the premise of data regulation rules like privacy protection, it may suffer from privacy leakage due to big data analytics with the help of machine learning. To make machine learning and blockchain useful and practical for diversified services in industrial sectors, it is of paramount importance to have a comprehensive understanding of the development of both technologies in the context of IIoT. To this end, in this paper we summarize and analyze the applications of blockchain and machine learning in IIoT from three important aspects, i.e., consensus mechanism, storage and communication. This survey provides a deeper understanding on the security and privacy risks of the key components of a blockchain from the perspective of machine learning, which is useful in the design of practical blockchain solutions for IIoT. In addition, we provide useful guidance for future research in the area by identifying interesting open problems that need to be addressed before large-scale deployments of IIoT applications are practicable.}

Although the existing spam filters have satisfying performance, they are facing the challenge of an adversary who misleads the spam filters by manipulating samples. Until now, the vulnerability of spam filtering technique for short messages has not been investigated. Different from the other spam applications, a short message only has a few words and its length usually has an upper limit. The current adversarial learning algorithms may not work efficiently in short message spam filtering. In this paper, we investigate the existing good word attack and its counterattack method, i.e. the feature reweighting, in short message spam filtering in an effort to understand whether, and to what extent, they can work efficiently when the length of a message is limited. This paper proposes a good word attack strategy which maximizes the influence to a classifier with the least number of inserted characters based on the weight values and also the length of words. On the other hand, we also proposes the feature reweighting method with a new rescaling function which minimizes the importance of the feature representing a short word in order to require more inserted characters for a successful evasion. The methods are evaluated experimentally by using the SMS and the comment spam dataset. The results confirm that the length of words is a critical factor of the robustness of short message spam filtering to good word attack.}

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) as one of the most important approaches to protect network security has been studied adequately in previous literatures. However, the performance of IDSs still needs to be improved to adapt the scenario of VANETs which are very fast moving and highly dynamic. In this paper, we propose a novel IDS that is able to be appropriately used in the wireless and dynamic networks, like VANETs. It mainly contains a novel feature extraction algorithm and a classifier based on an improved growing hierarchical self-organizing map (I-GHSOM) for IDS in VANETs. The proposed feature extraction algorithm is used to quickly extract distinct features from vehicle messages for IDS’s training and test. In the proposed algorithm, two key features including the differences of traffic flow and of position are extracted. The former feature is calculated according to the range of the distance between vehicles, while both a voting filter mechanism and a semi-cooperative mechanism are designed to get the latter feature. Furthermore, in the I-GHSOM-based classifier, for quickly attaining precise classification results, two novel mechanisms (relabeling and recalculating mechanisms) are proposed to relabel the units of GHSOM and check whether the balance of GHSOM structure is broken or not. Simulation results show that the proposed IDS is better than others in the measurement of accuracy, stability, processing efficiency and message scales.}

Several techniques have been investigated for detecting anomalies in system call sequences. Among these, Sequence Time-Delay Embedding (STIDE), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) have shown a high level of anomaly detection accuracy. Although ADSs can detect novel attacks, they generate a large number of false alarms due to the difficulty in obtaining complete descriptions of normal software behavior. This paper presents a multiple-detector ADS that efficiently combines the decisions from heterogeneous detectors (e.g., STIDE, HMM, and OCSVM), using Boolean combination in the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) space, to reduce the false alarms. Results on two modern and large system call datasets generated from Linux and Windows operating systems show that the proposed ADS consistently outperforms an ADS based on a single best detector and on an ensemble of homogeneous detectors. At an operating point of zero percent alarm rate, the proposed multiple-detector ADS increased the true positive rate by 500% on the Linux dataset and by 25% on the Window dataset. Furthermore, the combinations of decisions from multiple heterogeneous detectors make the ADS more reliable and resilient against evasion and adversarial attacks.}

abstract = {As complete prevention of computer attacks is not possible, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) play a very important role in minimizing the damage caused by different computer attacks. There are two intrusion detection methods: namely misuse- and anomaly-based. A collaborative, intelligent intrusion detection system (CIIDS) is proposed to include both methods, since it is concluded from recent research that the performance of an individual detection engine is rarely satisfactory. In particular, two main challenges in current collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) research are highlighted and reviewed: CIDSs system architectures and alert correlation algorithms. Different CIDSs system, architectures are explained and compared. The use of CIDSs together with other multiple security systems raise certain issues and challenges in, alert correlation. Several different techniques for alert correlation are discussed. The focus will be on correlation of CIIDS alerts. Computational, Intelligence approaches, together with their applications on IDSs, are reviewed. Methods in soft computing collectively provide understandable, and autonomous solutions to IDS problems. At the end of the review, the paper suggests fuzzy logic, soft computing and other AI techniques, to be exploited to reduce the rate of false alarms while keeping the detection rate high. In conclusion, the paper highlights opportunities for an integrated solution to large-scale CIIDS.}

Intelligent and adaptive attackers may indeed exploit specific vulnerabilities exposed by machine learning techniques to violate system security. Being robust to adversarial data manipulation is thus an important, additional requirement for machine learning algorithms to successfully operate in adversarial settings. In this work, we evaluate the security of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to well-crafted, adversarial label noise attacks. In particular, we consider an attacker that aims to maximize the SVM׳s classification error by flipping a number of labels in the training data. We formalize a corresponding optimal attack strategy, and solve it by means of heuristic approaches to keep the computational complexity tractable. We report an extensive experimental analysis on the effectiveness of the considered attacks against linear and non-linear SVMs, both on synthetic and real-world datasets. We finally argue that our approach can also provide useful insights for developing more secure SVM learning algorithms, and also novel techniques in a number of related research areas, such as semi-supervised and active learning.}

abstract = {Computer systems evolve to be more complex and vulnerable. Cyber attacks have also grown to be more sophisticated and harder to detect. Intrusion detection is the process of monitoring and identifying unauthorized system access or manipulation. It becomes increasingly difficult for a single intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect all attacks due to limited knowledge about attacks. Collaboration among intrusion detection devices can be used to gain higher detection accuracy and cost efficiency as compared to its traditional single host-based counterpart. Through cooperation, a local IDS can detect new attacks that may be known to other IDSs, which may be from different vendors. However, how to utilize the diagnosis from different IDSs to perform intrusion detection is the key challenge. This paper proposes a system architecture of a collaborative intrusion detection network (CIDN), in which trustworthy and efficient feedback aggregation is a key component. To achieve a reliable and trustworthy CIDN, we present a framework called FACID, which leverages data analytical models and hypothesis testing methods for efficient, distributed and sequential feedback aggregations. FACID provides an inherent trust evaluation mechanism and reduces communication overhead needed for IDSs as well as the computational resources and memory needed to achieve satisfactory feedback aggregation results when the number of collaborators of an IDS is large. Our simulation results corroborate our theoretical results and demonstrate the properties of cost efficiency and accuracy compared to other heuristic methods. The analytical result on the lower-bound of the average number of acquaintances for consultation is essential for the design and configuration of IDSs in a collaborative environment.}

A number of studies came forward showing the potency of attacks, introducing new varieties and discussing potential detection strategies. The underlying problem that triggered all this research is the stealthiness of application layer DoS attacks. Since they usually do not manifest themselves at the network level, these types of attacks commonly avoid traditional network-layer based detection mechanisms. In this work we turn our attention to this problem and present a novel detection approach for application layer DoS attacks based on nonparametric CUSUM algorithm. We explore the effectiveness of our detection on various types of these attacks in the context of modern web servers. Since in production environments detection is commonly performed on a sampled subset of network traffic, we also study the impact of sampling techniques on detection of application layer DoS attack. Our results demonstrate that the majority of sampling techniques developed specifically for intrusion detection domain introduce significant distortion in the traffic that minimizes a detection algorithm’s ability to capture the traces of these stealthy attacks.}

This historical login activity is represented as a collection of daily login graphs, which encode authentications among accessed systems with vertices representing computer systems and directed edges logins between them. We devise a method of local graph anomaly detection capable of identifying unusual vertices that indicate potentially malicious login events to the systems they represent. We test this capability on a group of highly-privileged accounts using real login data from an operational enterprise network. The method enjoys false positive rates significantly lower than those resulting from alerts based solely on login novelty, and is generally successful at detecting a wide variety of simulated adversarial login activity.}

However, many studies have shown that the models built upon ML technologies are vulnerable to noises and adversarial attacks. A number of works have studied the robust models against noise or adversarial examples in image domains and text processing domains, however, it is more challenging to learn robust models in graph domains. Adding noises or perturbations on graph data will make the robustness even harder to enhance – the noises and perturbations of edges or node attributes are easy to propagate to other neighbors via the relational information on a graph. In this paper, we investigate and summarize the existing works that study the robust deep learning models against adversarial attacks or noises on graphs, namely the robust learning (models) on graphs. Specifically, we first provide some robustness evaluation metrics of model robustness on graphs. Then, we comprehensively provide a taxonomy which groups robust models on graphs into five categories: anomaly detection, adversarial training, pre-processing, attention mechanism, and certifiable robustness. Besides, we emphasize some promising future directions in learning robust models on graphs. Hopefully, our works can offer insights for the relevant researchers, thus providing assistance for their studies.}

Among all the solutions that have been proposed so far, the analysis of the HTTP payload at the byte level has proven to be effective as it does not require the detailed knowledge of the applications running on the Web server. The solutions proposed in the literature actually achieved good results for the detection rate, while there is still room for reducing the false positive rate. To this end, in this paper we propose HMMPayl, an IDS where the payload is represented as a sequence of bytes, and the analysis is performed using Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The algorithm we propose for feature extraction and the joint use of HMM guarantee the same expressive power of n – gram analysis, while allowing to overcome its computational complexity. In addition, we designed HMMPayl following the Multiple Classifiers System paradigm to provide for a better classification accuracy, to increase the difficulty of evading the IDS, and to mitigate the weaknesses due to a non optimal choice of HMM parameters. Experimental results, obtained both on public and private datasets, show that the analysis performed by HMMPayl is particularly effective against the most frequent attacks toward Web applications (such as XSS and SQL-Injection). In particular, for a fixed false positive rate, HMMPayl achieves a higher detection rate respect to previously proposed approaches it has been compared with.}

However, the existence of potential secure vulnerabilities limits the application of deep learning in IIoT. Therefore, how to provide secure deep learning services in IIoT applications becomes an important research topic. Among various attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs), backdoor attacks are generally recognized as the most imperceptible type, where an attacker can upload a poisoned DNN model that misbehaves only when inputs contain specific triggers. Existing defense solutions assume a defender has prior knowledge of backdoor triggers or DNN models, remaining far away from practical and flexible. To this end, this paper proposes a collaborative deep learning microservice, CoDefend, which employs strong intentional perturbation (STRIP) and cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) to defend against backdoored neural networks. Compared with previous work, CoDefend has the advantages of flexibility and practicality. Empirical evaluations validate the high efficacy of CoDefend in providing secure deep learning microservices to IIoT.}

This mobile application ecosystem could be used to distribute the malicious apps which are specifically designed to track behaviour of users, spy on the activities of users, and could be a threat to the privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of the users. In this paper, we present a novel approach called DEEPSEL (Deep Feature Selection), a deep learning-based method for the identification of malware and malicious codes within android applications. DEEPSEL uses a set of features to characterize the behaviour of android applications and classify them as legitimate and malicious. The main contribution is characterized by the usage of particle swarm optimization for performing feature selection.

Even when they are secured with encryption and authentication, these things are exposed both to wireless attacks from inside the 6LoWPAN network and from the Internet. Since these attacks may succeed, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are necessary. Currently, there are no IDSs that meet the requirements of the IPv6-connected IoT since the available approaches are either customized for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) or for the conventional Internet. In this paper we design, implement, and evaluate a novel intrusion detection system for the IoT that we call SVELTE. In our implementation and evaluation we primarily target routing attacks such as spoofed or altered information, sinkhole, and selective-forwarding. However, our approach can be extended to detect other attacks. We implement SVELTE in the Contiki OS and thoroughly evaluate it. Our evaluation shows that in the simulated scenarios, SVELTE detects all malicious nodes that launch our implemented sinkhole and/or selective forwarding attacks. However, the true positive rate is not 100%, i.e., we have some false alarms during the detection of malicious nodes. Also, SVELTE’s overhead is small enough to deploy it on constrained nodes with limited energy and memory capacity.}

However, protecting edge networks against zero-day attacks is challenging, due to the volume, variety and veracity of data collected from the large numbers of IoT devices in edge networks. In this paper, we propose a Distributed Anomaly Detection (DAD) system to discover zero-day attacks in edge networks. The proposed system uses Gaussian Mixture-based Correntropy, a novel ensemble one-class statistical learning model, which is designed to effectively monitor and recognize zero-day attacks in real-time from edge networks. We also design an IoT-edge-cloud architecture to illustrate the complexity of edge networks and how one can deploy the proposed system at network gateways. The proposed system is evaluated using both NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets. The findings reveal that the proposed system achieves better performance, in terms of detection accuracy and processing time, compared with five anomaly detection techniques.}

So, a good dataset of the system is desirable for designing an automated failure detection system. However, industrial process datasets are unbalanced and contain little information about failure behavior due to the uniqueness of these events and the high cost for running the system just to get information about the undesired behaviors. For this reason, performing correct training and validation of automated failure detection methods is challenging. This paper proposes a methodology called FaultFace for failure detection on Ball-Bearing joints for rotational shafts using deep learning techniques to create balanced datasets. The FaultFace methodology uses 2D representations of vibration signals denominated faceportraits obtained by time–frequency transformation techniques. From the obtained faceportraits, a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network is employed to produce new faceportraits of the nominal and failure behaviors to get a balanced dataset. A Convolutional Neural Network is trained for fault detection employing the balanced dataset. The FaultFace methodology is compared with other deep learning techniques to evaluate its performance in for fault detection with unbalanced datasets. Obtained results show that FaultFace methodology has a good performance for failure detection for unbalanced datasets.}

Most anomaly detectors rely on machine learning algorithms to derive a model of normality that is later used to detect suspicious events. Such algorithms, however, are generally susceptible to evasion by means of carefully constructed attacks that are not recognized as anomalous. Different strategies to thwart evasion have been proposed over the last years, including the use of randomization to make somewhat uncertain how each packet will be processed. In this paper we analyze the strength of the randomization strategy suggested for Anagram, a well-known anomaly detector based on n-gram models. We show that an adversary who can interact with the system for a short period of time with inputs of his choosing will be able to recover the secret mask used to process packets. We describe and discuss an efficient algorithm to do this and report our experiences with a prototype implementation. Furthermore, we show that the specific form of randomization suggested for Anagram is a double-edged sword, as knowledge of the mask makes evasion easier than in the non-randomized case. We finally discuss a simple countermeasure to prevent our attacks.}

Literature studies have revealed several reliable approaches based on intrusion detection system (IDS), to protect VANETs against attacks. However, by those solutions, the overheads of IDSs are serious which cause too long detection time, especially when the number of vehicles increases. In this paper, we propose a novel filter model based hidden Markov model (HMM) (FM-HMM) for IDS to reduce the overhead and time for detection without impairing detection rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in the literature to model the state pattern of each vehicle in VANETs as a HMM to quickly filter the messages from the vehicles instead of detecting these messages. The FM-HMM consists of three modules, i.e., schedule, filter and update. In the schedule module, Baum–Welch algorithm is used to produce a HMM and its parameters for each neighbor vehicle. In the filter module, multiple HMMs are used with their parameters to forecast the future states of neighbor vehicles with which the messages from them are filtered. In the update module, a timeliness method is used to update HMMs and their parameters. Experiments show that the IDS with FM-HMM has a better performance in terms of detection rate, detection time and overhead.}

With the rising prominence of advanced persistent threats (APTs), identifying and understanding such attacks has become increasingly important. Current signature-based systems are heavily reliant on fixed patterns that struggle with unknown or evasive applications, while behavior-based solutions usually leave most of the interpretative work to a human analyst. In this article we propose AIDIS, an Advanced Intrusion Detection and Interpretation System capable to explain anomalous behavior within a network-enabled user session by considering kernel event anomalies identified through their deviation from a set of baseline process graphs. For this purpose we adapt star structures, a bipartite representation used to approximate the edit distance between two graphs. Baseline templates are generated automatically and adapt to the nature of the respective operating system process. We prototypically implemented smart anomaly classification through a set of competency questions applied to graph template deviations and evaluated the approach using both Random Forest and linear kernel support vector machines. The determined attack classes are ultimately mapped to a dedicated APT attacker/defender meta model that considers actions, actors, as well as assets and mitigating controls, thereby enabling decision support and contextual interpretation of ongoing attacks.}

Due to the tight coupling of cyber and physical domains, and to the possible catastrophic consequences of the malicious attacks on critical infrastructures, security is one of the key concerns. However, the exponential growth of IoT has led to deployment of CPSes without support for enforcing important security properties. Specification-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been shown to be effective for securing these systems. Mining the specifications of CPSes by experts is a cumbersome and error-prone task. Therefore, it is essential to dynamically monitor the CPS to learn its common behaviors and formulate specifications for detecting malicious bugs and security attacks. Existing solutions for specification mining only combine data and events, but not time. However, time is a semantic property in CPS systems, and hence incorporating time in addition to data and events, is essential for obtaining high accuracy. This paper proposes ARTINALI++, which dynamically mines specifications in CPS systems with arbitrary size and complexity. ARTINALI++ captures the security properties by incorporating time as a substantial property of the system, and generate a multi-dimensional model for the general CPS systems. Moreover, it enhances the model through discovering invariants that represent the physical motions and distinct operational modes in complex CPS systems. We build Intrusion Detection Systems based on ARTINALI++ for three CPSes with various levels of complexity including smart meter, smart artificial pancreas and unmanned aerial vehicle, and measure their detection accuracy. We find that the ARTINALI++ significantly reduces the ratio of false positives and false negatives by 23.45% and 73.6% on average, respectively, over other dynamic specification mining tools on the three CPS platforms.}

abstract = {Machine learning classification algorithms are widely applied to different malware analysis problems because of their proven abilities to learn from examples and perform relatively well with little human input. Use cases include the labelling of malicious samples according to families during triage of suspected malware. However, automated algorithms are vulnerable to attacks. An attacker could carefully manipulate the sample to force the algorithm to produce a particular output. In this paper we discuss one such attack on Android malware classifiers. We design and implement a prototype tool, called IagoDroid, that takes as input a malware sample and a target family, and modifies the sample to cause it to be classified as belonging to this family while preserving its original semantics. Our technique relies on a search process that generates variants of the original sample without modifying their semantics. We tested IagoDroid against RevealDroid, a recent, open source, Android malware classifier based on a variety of static features. IagoDroid successfully forces misclassification for 28 of the 29 representative malware families present in the DREBIN dataset. Remarkably, it does so by modifying just a single feature of the original malware. On average, it finds the first evasive sample in the first search iteration, and converges to a 100% evasive population within 4 iterations. Finally, we introduce RevealDroid*, a more robust classifier that implements several techniques proposed in other adversarial learning domains. Our experiments suggest that RevealDroid* can correctly detect up to 99% of the variants generated by IagoDroid.}

abstract = {Smart Grid (SG) systems are critical, intelligent infrastructure utility services connected through open networks that are potentially susceptible to cyber-attacks with very acute security risks of shutdown, loss of life, and loss of revenue. Traditional intrusion detection systems based on signature and anomaly techniques are no longer sufficient to protect SGs due to their new connectivity and management challenges, the ever-rapidly-evolving masquerades, and cyber criminality levied against them. SGs require cyber-security systems to render them resilient and protected through advanced Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) techniques and mechanisms. This paper proposes a smart collaborative advanced IDPS to provide the best possible protection of SGs with a fully distributed management structure that supports the network and host based detections and the prevention of attacks. By facilitating a reliable, scalable, and flexible design, the specific requirements of IDPS for SGs can be more easily met via a fuzzy risk analyzer, an independent and ontology knowledge-based inference engine module. These can work collaboratively by managing functions across multiple IDPS domains. A set of extensive and intensive simulated experiments shows that with its smart advanced components incorporating soft computing machine-learning techniques and a rich ontology knowledge base with fuzzy logic analysis, it detects and prevents intrusions more efficiently. The multi-faceted results of the simulation also show that the proposed Collaborative Smart IDPS (CSIDPS) system increases the intrusion detection accuracy and decreases the false positive alarms when compared to traditional IDPSs. This is epitomized by the skillful use of the confusion matrix technique for organizing classifiers, visualizing their performance, and assessing their overall behavior. In the final analysis, the CSIDPS architecture is designed toward contributing to de facto norms for SG ecosystems.}

Researchers have provided a survey on several intrusion detection techniques for detecting intrusions in the cloud computing environment. Most of them provide a discussion over traditional misuse and anomaly detection techniques. Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) techniques are very helpful in detecting various stealth attacks targeting user-level and kernel-level processes running in virtual machines (VMs) by placing the analyzing component outside the VM generally at hypervisor. Hypervisor Introspection (HVI) techniques ensure the hypervisor security and prevent a compromised hypervisor to launch further attacks on VMs running over it. Introspection techniques introspect the hypervisor by using hardware-assisted virtualization-enabled technologies. The main focus of our paper is to provide an exhaustive literature survey of various Intrusion Detection techniques proposed for cloud environment with an analysis of their attack detection capability. We propose a threat model and attack taxonomy in cloud environment to elucidate the vulnerabilities in cloud. Our taxonomy of IDS techniques represent the state of the art classification and provides a detailed study of techniques with their distinctive features. We have provided a deep insight into Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) and Hypervisor Introspection (HVI) based techniques in the survey.

This novel cybersecurity attack, that is emerging in both the literature and in the wild, has proved to be very effective given the simplicity of running a crypto-client into a target device. Several countermeasures have recently been proposed, with different features and performance, but all characterized by a host-based architecture. The cited solutions, designed to protect the individual user, are not suitable for efficiently protecting a corporate network, especially against insiders. In this paper, we propose a network-based approach to detect and identify crypto-clients activities by solely relying on the network traffic, even when encrypted and mixed with non-malicious traces. First, we provide a detailed analysis of the real network traces generated by three major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Monero, and Bytecoin, considering both the normal traffic and the one shaped by a VPN. Then, we propose Crypto-Aegis, a Machine Learning (ML) based framework built over the results of our investigation, aimed at detecting cryptocurrencies related activities, e.g., pool mining, solo mining, and active full nodes. Our solution achieves a striking 0.96 of F1-score and 0.99 of AUC for the ROC, while enjoying a few other properties, such as device and infrastructure independence. Given the extent and novelty of the addressed threat we believe that our approach, supported by its excellent results, pave the way for further research in this area.}

Traditional malware detection has proven unable to keep pace with the sheer number of malware because of their growing complexity, new attacks and variants. Most malware implement various metamorphic techniques in order to disguise themselves, therefore preventing successful analysis and thwarting the detection by signature-based anti-malware engines. During the past decade, there has been an increase in the research and deployment of anti-malware engines powered by machine learning, and in particular deep learning, due to their ability to handle huge volumes of malware and generalize to never-before-seen samples. However, there is little research about the vulnerability of these models to adversarial examples. To fill this gap, this paper presents an exhaustive evaluation of the state-of-the-art approaches for malware classification against common metamorphic attacks. Given the limitations found in deep learning approaches, we present a simple architecture that increases 14.95% the classification performance with respect to MalConv’s architecture. Furthermore, the use of the metamorphic techniques to augment the training set is investigated and results show that it significantly improves the classification of malware belonging to families with few samples.}

Most of the proposals for their detection suggested recognition methods based on the comparison of use models of the protected environment. However recent studies have shown their vulnerability against adversarial attacks based on imitating the behavior of legitimate users. In order to contribute to their identification, this article introduces a novel detection method robust against evasion strategies based on mimicry. The proposal described two levels of information processing: analysis and verification. At the analysis stage, local alignment algorithms are implemented. In this way it is possible to score the similarity between action sequences performed by users, bearing in mind their regions of greatest resemblance. On the other hand, a novel validation scheme based on the statistical non-parametric U-test is implemented. Through this it is possible to refine the labeling of sequences to avoid making hasty decisions when their nature is not sufficiently clear. In order to strengthen their effectiveness against mimicry attacks, the analysis of the monitored sequences is performed in concurrency. This involves partitioning long sequences with two purposes: making subsequences of small intrusions more visible and analyzing new sequences when suspicious situations occur, such as the execution of never before seen commands or the discovery of potentially harmful activities. The proposal has been evaluated from the functional standard SEA and mimicry attacks. Promising experimental results have been shown, demonstrating great precision against conventional masqueraders (TPR=98.3%, FPR=0.77%) and a success rate of 80.2% when identifying mimicry attacks, hence outperforming the best contributions of bibliography.}

However, deep generative models aim at recovering the data distribution rather than detecting anomalies. Moreover, deep generative models have the risk of overfitting training samples, which has disastrous effects on anomaly detection performance. To solve the above two problems, we propose a self-adversarial variational autoencoder (adVAE) with a Gaussian anomaly prior assumption. We assume that both the anomalous and the normal prior distribution are Gaussian and have overlaps in the latent space. Therefore, a Gaussian transformer net T is trained to synthesize anomalous but near-normal latent variables. Keeping the original training objective of a variational autoencoder, a generator G tries to distinguish between the normal latent variables encoded by E and the anomalous latent variables synthesized by T, and the encoder E is trained to discriminate whether the output of G is real. These new objectives we added not only give both G and E the ability to discriminate, but also become an additional regularization mechanism to prevent overfitting. Compared with other competitive methods, the proposed model achieves significant improvements in extensive experiments. The employed datasets and our model are available in a Github repository.}

However, prior research reveals that several network-level attacks can be performed due to the lack of defense mechanisms in the CAN bus. In this work, we propose CAN Bus Message Attack Detection Framework (CAN-ADF) - a comprehensive anomaly generation, detection, and evaluation system for a CAN bus. In CAN-ADF, not only various anomalies and attack characteristics can be configured but also different detection methods, and visualization frameworks are provided to effectively detect those attacks and anomalies. For the detector, we employ both a rule-based approach crafted from dynamic network traffic characteristics and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). For evaluation, we use 7,875,791 in-vehicle CAN packets collected from real cars, KIA Soul and Hyundai Sonata. Our detection algorithm achieves accurate intrusion detection performance, with an average accuracy of 99.45% on CAN datasets, outperforming prior approach. Furthermore, we developed a visualization tool to validate the detection of anomalies by CAN-ADF and to find new patterns in the dataset.}

abstract = {In the network traffic intrusion detection, deep learning based schemes have attracted lots of achievements. However, in real-world scenarios, data is often insufficient (few-shot), which leads to various deviations between the models prediction and the ground truth. Consequently, downstream tasks such as unknown attack detection based on few-shot will be limited by insufficient data. In this paper, we propose a novel unknown attack detection method based on Intra Categories Generation in Embedding Space, namely SFE-GACN, which might be the solution of few-shot problem. Concretely, we first propose Session Feature Embedding (SFE) to summarize the context of basic granularity of network traffic: sessions, bring the insufficient data to the pre-trained embedding space. In this way, we achieve the goal of preliminary information extension in the few-shot case. Second, we further propose the Generative Adversarial Cooperative Network (GACN), which improves the conventional Generative Adversarial Network by supervising the generated sample to avoid falling into similar categories, and thus enables samples to generate intra categories. Our proposed SFE-GACN achieved that it can accurately generate session samples in the case of few-shot, and ensure the difference between categories during data augmentation. The detection results show that compared to the state-of-the-art method, the average TPR is 8.38% higher, and the average FPR is 12.77% lower. In addition, we evaluated the graphics generation capabilities of GACN on the graphics dataset, the result shows our proposed GACN can be popularized for generating easy-confused multi-categories graphics.}

abstract = {An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a software application or device that monitors the system or activities of network for policy violations or malicious activities and generates reports to the management system. A number of systems may try to prevent an intrusion attempt but this is neither required nor expected of a monitoring system. The main focus of Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) is to identify the possible incidents, logging information about them and in report attempts. In addition, organizations use IDPS for other purposes, like identifying problems with security policies, deterring individuals and documenting existing threats from infringing security policies. IDPS have become an essential addition to the security infrastructure of nearly every organization. Various methods can be used to detect intrusions but each one is specific to a specific method. The main goal of an intrusion detection system is to detect the attacks efficiently. Furthermore, it is equally important to detect attacks at a beginning stage in order to reduce their impacts. This research work proposed a new approach called outlier detection where, the anomaly dataset is measured by the Neighborhood Outlier Factor (NOF). Here, trained model consists of big datasets with distributed storage environment for improving the performance of Intrusion Detection system. The experimental results proved that the proposed approach identifies the anomalies very effectively than any other approaches.}

abstract = {Some applications have the property of being resilient, meaning that they are robust to noise (e.g. due to error) in the data. This characteristic is very useful in situations where an approximate computation allows to perform the task in less time or to deploy the algorithm on embedded hardware. Deep learning is one of the fields that can benefit from approximate computing to reduce the high number of involved parameters thanks to its impressive generalization ability. A common approach is to prune some neurons and perform an iterative re-training with the aim of both reducing the required memory and to speed-up the inference stage. In this work we propose to face CNN size reduction from a different perspective: instead of reducing the network weights or look for an approximated network very close to the Pareto frontier, we investigate whether it is possible to remove some neurons only from the fully connected layers before the network training without substantially affecting the network performance. As a case study, we will focus on “fine-tuning”, a branch of transfer learning that has shown its effectiveness especially in domains lacking effective expert-designed features. To further compact the network, we apply weight quantization to the convolutional kernels. Results show that it is possible to tailor some layers to reduce the network size, both in terms of the number of parameters to learn and required memory, without statistically affecting the performance and without the need for any additional training. Finally, we investigate to what extent the sizing operation affects the network robustness against adversarial perturbations, a set of approaches aimed at misleading deep neural networks.}

To deal with the analytics using such a huge amount of IIoT data, different Deep Learning (DL)-based analytical models are deployed. The learning process in an analytical model needs to follow a reliable and trustworthy life cycle for crucial analysis and decision making. Similarly, considering the vulnerabilities in different levels of an IIoT network, the learning process should be reliable and trustworthy. In this paper, we propose a reliable DL-based routing attack detection scheme for IIoT. We consider adversarial training of the model for detecting intended attacks in Routing Protocol in Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). This helps in achieving a reliable learning model. A Generative Adversarial Network-Classifier (GAN-C) method has been developed for attack detection events which is a two stage combination of GAN and SVM models. We evaluate the performance improvement in GAN-C with respect to a standalone Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The proposed method adopts parallel learning and detection model which supports DL on computationally constrained IIoT devices. The results of the parallel model are evaluated in an IIoT network to draw a performance comparison between distributed and centralized attack detection in an RPL network. The use of the parallel GAN-C model also shows a significant reduction in training time.}

Building on Trait Activation Theory, we predict that the unstructured environment computer attacks will elicit individual differences in decision making that can be attributed (in part) to differences in personality traits. Here we examine the varying approaches that individuals high in different Dark Triad traits and deception strategies take in executing cyberattacks. Using a hypothetical game scenario, Study 1 found that long-term mimicry deception and Machiavellianism were strong predictors of stealthy attacks, whereas narcissism and psychopathy were associated with shorter term or aggressive (i.e., “brute force”) attacks. Study 2 replicated this general pattern of results in a realistic lab simulation. The findings speak to the differential nature of the Dark Triad in the unstructured environment of cyber-attacks. These findings also contribute to our knowledge of how different attacks may emanate from individuals with different manipulative personality traits.}

In order to solve the problem of the scarcity of attack industrial control datasets, this paper proposes an attack sample generation algorithm. Firstly, based on the weight and degree of membership distribution, calculate the value of membership distance between dimensions, and the data association is strong when the membership distance of dimensions is small. Then, divide dimensions which have small distance into a group, so as to realize the association grouping of the original data. The data association of dimensions in an association group is strong when the association group appears frequently. According to the frequency of the association group, all the association groups are divided into strong association group and weak association group. Attack all the dimensions of one strong association group in the original data by false data injection attack, realized attack sample generation algorithm in the original data. Finally, expand the attack sample into a large amount of attack sample industrial control dataset by the Generative Adversarial Network. In this paper, the attack samples are generated by the BATADAL dataset and the business dataset of an oil depot, and the data is expanded by 100 times through the algorithm. Compared with the attack samples provided by the BATADAL dataset, the coincidence degree and fitting degree of generated data is improved by 38.20%–42.94% and 98.22%–98.36%, respectively. The classification results of XGBoost and SVM are 100% and 98.01%, which is close to the classification result of attack samples provided by BATADAL dataset.}

At first, we use a large quantity of data in terms of frequencies and amplitudes of some electromagnetic waves to train our models. And then, we use the obtained models to predict that whether a GSMem attack occurs or not, according to a given frequency and amplitude. In a word, the GSMem intrusion detection problem is induced to a ML binary classification one, while the former problem is pending and the latter one has been solved. As a result, the former problem can be solved in principle in this way. The simulated experiments show that the new method is potential to detect a GSMem attack, with low False Positive Rates (FPR) and low False Negative Rates (FNR).}

PiNcH is built applying standard classification algorithms to the eavesdropped traffic, analyzing features such as packets inter-arrival time and size. PiNcH is fully passive and it requires just cheap and general-purpose hardware. To evaluate the effectiveness of our solution, we collected real communication traces originated by a drone running the widespread ArduCopter open-source firmware, currently mounted on-board of a wide range (30+) of commercial amateur drones. Then, we tested our solution against different publicly available wireless traces. The results prove that PiNcH can efficiently and effectively: (i) identify the presence of the drone in several heterogeneous scenarios; (ii) identify the current state of a powered-on drone, i.e., flying or lying on the ground; (iii) discriminate the movements of the drone; and, finally, (iv) enjoy a reduced upper bound on the time required to identify a drone with the requested level of assurance. The effectiveness of PiNcH has been also evaluated in the presence of both heavy packet loss and evasion attacks. In this latter case, the adversary modifies on purpose the profile of the traffic of the drone-RC link to avoid the detection. In both the cited cases, PiNcH continues enjoying a remarkable performance. Further, the comparison against state of the art solution confirms the superior performance of PiNcH in several scenarios. Note that all the drone-controller generated data traces have been released as open-source, to allow replicability and foster follow-up. Finally, the quality and viability of our solution, do prove that network traffic analysis can be successfully adopted for drone identification and status discrimination, and pave the way for future research in the area.}

Proactive dynamic defenses provide a strategic and holistic security mechanism to increase the costs of attacks and mitigate the risks. This work proposes a dynamic game framework to model a long-term interaction between a stealthy attacker and a proactive defender. The stealthy and deceptive behaviors are captured by the multi-stage game of incomplete information, where each player has his own private information unknown to the other. Both players act strategically according to their beliefs which are formed by the multi-stage observation and learning. The perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium provides a useful prediction of both players’ policies because no players benefit from unilateral deviations from the equilibrium. We propose an iterative algorithm to compute the perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium and use the Tennessee Eastman process as a benchmark case study. Our numerical experiment corroborates the analytical results and provides further insights into the design of proactive defense-in-depth strategies.}

abstract = {Detecting anomalies accurately in time series data has been receiving considerable attention due to its enormous potential for a wide array of applications. Numerous unsupervised anomaly detection methods for time series have been developed because of the difficulty of obtaining accurate labels. However, most existing unsupervised approaches suffer from the problem of anomaly contamination, which results in models that are unable to learn the normal pattern well and further deteriorate the performance of detection methods. To this end, a novel unsupervised method, called Self-adversarial Variational Autoencoder with Spectral Residual (SaVAE-SR), is introduced for time series anomaly detection in this paper. The SaVAE-SR first produces labels for unlabeled training data using the spectral residual technique to identify the most critical anomalies. A VAE model with a modified loss that can leverage label information to remove the influence of anomalous points is then trained in a self-adversarial manner, enabling the model to self-evaluate the learning of complex data distribution and improve itself accordingly. Specifically, the encoder acts as an encoder to approximate the posterior of latent variables and as a discriminator to evaluate the generative ability of the generator and improve itself accordingly. The generator is trained to capture the underlying data distribution and attempts to produce real samples to deceive the discriminator. The encoder and generator of the model compete with each other just like the behavior of GANs but work together under the theoretical framework of VAEs. As a result, the SaVAE-SR model combines the respective strengths of the VAE and adversarial training but does not require an additional discriminator, which makes the whole model very compact. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the existing state-of-the-art methods.}

FL is a new research area often referred to as a new dawn in AI, is in its infancy, and has not yet gained much trust in the community, mainly because of its (unknown) security and privacy implications. To advance the state of the research in this area and to realize extensive utilization of the FL approach and its mass adoption, its security and privacy concerns must be first identified, evaluated, and documented. FL is preferred in use-cases where security and privacy are the key concerns and having a clear view and understanding of risk factors enable an implementer/adopter of FL to successfully build a secure environment and gives researchers a clear vision on possible research areas. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive study concerning FL’s security and privacy aspects that can help bridge the gap between the current state of federated AI and a future in which mass adoption is possible. We present an illustrative description of approaches and various implementation styles with an examination of the current challenges in FL and establish a detailed review of security and privacy concerns that need to be considered in a thorough and clear context. Findings from our study suggest that overall there are fewer privacy-specific threats associated with FL compared to security threats. The most specific security threats currently are communication bottlenecks, poisoning, and backdoor attacks while inference-based attacks are the most critical to the privacy of FL. We conclude the paper with much needed future research directions to make FL adaptable in realistic scenarios.}

This paper reviews the data preprocessing techniques used by anomaly-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), concentrating on which aspects of the network traffic are analyzed, and what feature construction and selection methods have been used. Motivation for the paper comes from the large impact data preprocessing has on the accuracy and capability of anomaly-based NIDS. The review finds that many NIDS limit their view of network traffic to the TCP/IP packet headers. Time-based statistics can be derived from these headers to detect network scans, network worm behavior, and denial of service attacks. A number of other NIDS perform deeper inspection of request packets to detect attacks against network services and network applications. More recent approaches analyze full service responses to detect attacks targeting clients. The review covers a wide range of NIDS, highlighting which classes of attack are detectable by each of these approaches. Data preprocessing is found to predominantly rely on expert domain knowledge for identifying the most relevant parts of network traffic and for constructing the initial candidate set of traffic features. On the other hand, automated methods have been widely used for feature extraction to reduce data dimensionality, and feature selection to find the most relevant subset of features from this candidate set. The review shows a trend toward deeper packet inspection to construct more relevant features through targeted content parsing. These context sensitive features are required to detect current attacks.}

Every cyber attack goes through several stages before its termination. Lateral Movement (LM) is one of those stages that is of particular importance. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a method used in LM to successfully authenticate to an unauthorized host that leaves footprints on both host and network logs.

Therefore, we propose three different preprocessing approaches for flow-based data in order to transform them into continuous values. Further, we present a new method for evaluating the generated flow-based network traffic which uses domain knowledge to define quality tests.

IDS is used to control and alert the cyber-attacks which are much redundant and generates many false alerts in real-life application. The filtering and classification of false alerts involve substantial investment and security analysis. We propose a self-Learning data management approach in terms of data characterization using SeLINA for minimizing false alerts. Two different queues namely: Normal Queue and Suspicious Queues are used for storing information without and with any false alert respectively. The Suspicious Queue then undergoes filtering using feature detection technique. Subsequently, the filtered information with no false alert signals is transferred to the Normal Queue using a supervised hierarchical structure towards minimization of false alerts. Consequently, this technique is helpful to identify malicious attacks easily with no extra time for false alert detection.}

abstract = {Network traffic classification is a significant and problematic aspect of network resource management arising from an investigation of network developments, planning, and design for 5G and beyond. Recently, traffic investigation systems for network monitoring and user access restrictions to Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and non-Virtual Private Networks (non-VPN) have gained widespread attention. In this paper, different algorithms for classifying and detecting VPN traffic are considered. A few existing machine learning procedures were tested concerning their performance in network traffic classification and security. The purpose is to improve Precision, Recall, and F1-score in VPN Network Traffic using Ensemble Classifiers. Therefore, the parameters of the ensemble classifier were changed to obtain high Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Bagging Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting algorithms were used for classification which produced promising results when compared to single classifiers like k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Decision Tree. The proposed classifier demonstrates recognition accuracy on a test sample of up to 93.80% which outperforms all other single algorithms used in previous work. The MLP, Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting (GB) algorithms had almost identical performance in all experiments. Furthermore, the proposed classifiers are found to perform better when the network traffic flows are generated using different values of time parameters (timeout). Our results show that the ensemble algorithms (Random Forest and the Gradient Boosting) outperform the single machine learning classifier previously used by other researchers, and we achieved the highest accuracy with the random forest classifier with better results while using non-VPN traffic and VPN traffic. The novelty lies in the application of an ensemble algorithm to secure a network traffic classification performed in comparison with single classifiers to determine Accuracy, Precision, and F1-score of a given dataset, contrary to the known process of selection of features and generation.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach for intrusion detection system based on sampling with Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM). Decision making is performed in two stages. In the first stage, the whole dataset is divided into some predetermined arbitrary subgroups. The proposed algorithm selects representative samples from these subgroups such that the samples reflect the entire dataset. An optimum allocation scheme is developed based on the variability of the observations within the subgroups. In the second stage, least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) is applied to the extracted samples to detect intrusions. We call the proposed algorithm as optimum allocation-based least square support vector machine (OA-LS-SVM) for IDS. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the experiments are carried out on KDD 99 database which is considered a de facto benchmark for evaluating the performance of intrusions detection algorithm. All binary-classes and multiclass are tested and our proposed approach obtains a realistic performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Finally a way out is also shown the usability of the proposed algorithm for incremental datasets.}

The unsupervised learning capability of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) provide a promising solution to this issue through their capacity to learn representations for novel data samples and classification tasks. In this research, a texture-based latent space disentanglement technique is proposed to enhance learning of representations for novel data samples. A comparison is performed among different VAEs and GANs with the proposed approach for synthesis of new data samples. Two different VAE architectures are considered, a single layer dense VAE and a convolution based VAE, to compare the effectiveness of different architectures for learning of the representations. The GANs are selected based on the distance metric for disjoint distribution divergence estimation of complex representation learning tasks. The proposed texture-based disentanglement has been shown to provide a significant improvement for disentangling the process of representation learning by conditioning the random noise and synthesising texture rich images of fruit and vegetables.}

The agents in each one of the layers are specialized in specific tasks, such as data gathering, data classification, and visualization. This study presents two key agents under a hybrid architecture: a classifier agent that incorporates a Case-Based Reasoning engine employing advanced algorithms in the reasoning cycle stages, and a visualizer agent that integrates several techniques to facilitate the visual analysis of suspicious queries. The former incorporates a new classification model based on a mixture of a neural network and a Support Vector Machine in order to classify SQL queries in a reliable way. The latter combines clustering and neural projection techniques to support the visual analysis and identification of target attacks.

When given a set of parameter values characterizing operational and environmental conditions, we identify the optimal intrusion detection rate and the optimal regional area size under which the mean time to security failure of the system is maximized and/or the total communication cost is minimized for GCSs in MANET environments.

Can the adversarial resilience of such systems be formally modeled and evaluated? Can we quantify this resilience such that different systems can be compared using empiric metrics? Past works have demonstrated how an adversary can manipulate a system based on machine learning techniques by changing some of its inputs. However, comparatively little work has emphasized the creation of a formal method for measuring and comparing the adversarial resilience of different machine learning models to these changes. In this work we study the adversarial resilience of detection systems based on supervised machine learning models. We provide a formal definition for adversarial resilience while focusing on multisensory fusion systems. We define the model robustness (MRB) score, a metric for evaluating the relative resilience of different models, and suggest two novel feature selection algorithms for constructing adversary aware classifiers. The first algorithm selects only features that cannot realistically be modified by the adversary, while the second algorithm allows control over the resilience versus accuracy tradeoff. Finally, we evaluate our approach with a real-life use case of dynamic malware classification using an extensive, up-to-date corpus of benign and malware executables. We demonstrate the potential of using adversary aware feature selection for building more resilient classifiers and provide empirical evidence supporting the inherent resilience of ensemble algorithms compared to single model algorithms.}

This is done using a new activation function to discard data. The added layer trains the neural network to filter-out usually-irrelevant parts of its input. Our performance evaluation shows that Spartan Networks have a slightly lower precision but report a higher robustness under attack when compared to unprotected models. Results of this study of Adversarial AI as a new attack vector are based on tests conducted on the MNIST dataset.}

abstract = {The rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) systems, has enabled transforming urban areas into smart cities. Smart cities’ paradigm has resulted in improved quality of life and better services to citizens, like smart healthcare, smart parking, smart transport, smart buildings, smart homes, and so on. One of the major challenges of IoT devices is the limited capacity of their battery because the devices consume a large amount of energy once they communicate with each other. Furthermore, the IoT-based smart systems would contain sensitive data about network systems, introducing serious privacy and security issues. IoT-based smart systems are highly exposed to botnet attacks. Examples of such attacks are Mirai and BASHLITE malware launched from compromised surveillance devices, which are common in smart cities, resulting in paralysis of Internet-based services through distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Such DDoS attacks on IoT devices and their networks further threaten the emerging concept of sustainable smart cities. To discover such cyberattacks, this paper proposes a novel statistical learning-based botnet detection framework, called IoTBoT-IDS, which protects IoT-based smart networks against botnet attacks. IoTBoT-IDS captures the normal behavior of IoT networks by applying statistical learning-based techniques, using Beta Mixture Model (BMM) and a Correntropy model. Any deviation from the normal behavior is detected as an anomalous event. To evaluate IoTBoT-IDS, three benchmark datasets generated from realistic IoT networks were used. The evaluation results showed that IoTBoT-IDS effectively identifies various types of botnets with an average detection accuracy of 99.2%, which is higher by about 2–5% compared with compelling intrusion detection methods, namely AdaBoost ensemble learning, fuzzy c-means, and deep feed forward neural networks.}

Specifically, wireless communication technology introduces additional vulnerability in terms of network security. In addition to cyber-security issues that have been investigated extensively, we must consider physical layer security. As such, considerable efforts have been employed toward developing a solution to address cyber-security issues. However, there are limited efforts on developing intrusion detection systems for physical layer security. In this paper, we propose an intelligent attack detection and identification model capable of classifying the attack type in the physical layer based on an ensemble of machine learning methods. Furthermore, the proposed model localizes the attack or fault to specific features or measurements in the system to assist cyber-security professionals in mitigating the effect of the attack in communication networks. The proposed model is evaluated on a smart grids dataset simulated by the Oak Ridge National Laboratories and is compared with traditional machine learning classifiers. The localization of attacks and faults is tested by splitting the data and measuring the correlation of the localization metrics produced by the proposed model. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method at classifying and localizing attacks compared to peer approaches.}

While dealing with imbalanced datasets, traditional supervised machine learning algorithms do not often provide acceptable results. Several approaches are used to handle the class imbalance problem. Of these, undersampling approaches are mostly followed by the researchers in which the number of instances in the majority class gets reduced. Selection of instances from the majority class can be considered as an optimization problem. To this end, in this paper, we present an undersampling approach based on widely-used Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The majority class samples are first clustered to form the initial undersampled set. The samples to be selected are then optimized using PSO to give the best model. The parameters of PSO are fine tuned using Learning Automata. Appropriate metrics suitable for class imbalance problems have been used to construct the fitness function for optimizing the undersampled training set. The proposed method has achieved 2% to 10% performance improvement over most of the contemporary methods on various datasets with imbalance ratios ranging from 5 to 130, thus showing that the method is robust and useful in practical scenarios.

In normal case, where intrusions are not detected, the most suitable IDS level is the coarse-grained to increase IDS performance. As soon as any intrusion is detected by coarse-grained IDS, the fine-grained is activated to detect the possible attack details. Very fast decision tree algorithm is used in both of these detection levels. In order to ensure efficiency of the proposed model, it has been tested on KDD CUP 99 offline dataset and a real traffic dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model is highly successful in detecting known and unknown attacks, and can be successfully adapted with packets' flow to increase IDS performance.

While such perturbations are often subtle and imperceptible from the perspective of a human, they can greatly affect the performance of machine learning models. This paper presents two methods of verifying the visual fidelity of image-based datasets by using QR codes to detect perturbations in the data. In the first method, a verification string is stored for each image in a dataset. These verification strings can be used to determine whether or not an image in the dataset has been perturbed.

The work carried out has focused on the study of a particular family of sensors, namely those which analyze the payload of network traffic looking for malware. Unlike conventional approaches, the information provided by the network packet headers is not taken into account. Instead, the proposed strategy considers the payload of the monitored traffic and the characteristics of the models built during the training of such detectors, in this way supporting the general-purpose incident management tools. It aims to analyze, classify and prioritize alerts issued, based on two criteria: the risk of threats being genuine and their nature. Incidences are studied both in a one-to-one and in a group context. This implies the consideration of two different processing layers: The first one allows fast reactions and resilience against certain adversarial attacks, and on the other hand, the deeper layer facilitates the reconstruction of attack scenarios and provides an overview of potential threats. Experiments conducted by analyzing real traffic demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposal.}

abstract = {The wide application of contour stellar images has helped researchers transform signal classification problems into image classification problems to solve signal recognition based on deep learning. However, deep neural networks (DNN) are quite vulnerable to adversarial examples, thus simply evaluating the adversarial attack performance on the signal sequence recognition model cannot meet the current security requirements. From the perspective of an attacker, this study converts individual signals into stellar contour images, and then generates adversarial examples to evaluate the adversarial attack impacts. The results show that whether the current input sample is a signal sequence or a converted image, the DNN is vulnerable to the threat of adversarial examples. In the selected methods, whether it is under different perturbations or signal-to-noise ratio (SNRs), the momentum iteration method has the best performance among them, and under the perturbation of 0.01, the attack performance is more than 10% higher than the fast gradient sign method. Also, to measure the invisibility of adversarial examples, the contour stellar images before and after the attack were compared to maintain a balance between the attack success rate and the attack concealment.}

It is largely adopted in intrusion detection systems, relying on unsupervised algorithms that have the potential to detect zero-day attacks; however, efficacy of algorithms varies depending on the observed system and the attacks. Selecting the algorithm that maximizes detection capability is a challenging task with no master key. This paper tackles the challenge above by devising and applying a methodology to identify relations between attack families, anomaly classes and algorithms. The implication is that an unknown attack belonging to a specific attack family is most likely to get observed by unsupervised algorithms that are particularly effective on such attack family. This paves the way to rules for the selection of algorithms based on the identification of attack families. The paper proposes and applies a methodology based on analytical and experimental investigations supported by a tool to i) identify which anomaly classes are most likely raised by the different attack families, ii) study suitability of anomaly detection algorithms to detect anomaly classes, iii) combine previous results to relate anomaly detection algorithms and attack families, and iv) define guidelines to select unsupervised algorithms for intrusion detection.}

As telecommunication technology improves, autonomous vehicles are getting connected to each other and to infrastructures, forming Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). CAVs will help humans achieve safe, efficient, and autonomous transportation systems. However, CAVs will face significant security challenges because many of their components are vulnerable to attacks, and a successful attack on a CAV may have significant impacts on other CAVs and infrastructures due to their interconnectivity. In this paper, we conduct a survey on 189 papers from 2000 to 2020 to understand state-of-the-art CAV attacks and defense techniques. Of those 189 papers, 131 were directly concerned with attack models or defense strategies for CAVs. This survey first presents a comprehensive overview of security attacks and their corresponding countermeasures on CAVs. We then discuss the details of attack models based on the targeted CAV components of attacks, access requirements, and attack motives. Finally, we identify some current research challenges and trends from the perspectives of both academic research and industrial development. Based on our studies of academic literature and industrial publications, we have not found any strong connection between academic research and industry’s implementation of CAV-related security issues. While efforts from CAV manufacturers to secure CAVs have been reported, there is no evidence to show that CAVs on the market can defend against some novel attack models that the research community has recently found. This survey may give researchers and engineers a better understanding of the current status and trend of CAV security for CAV’s future improvement.}

They observe the actions of the system and its users and make decisions about the legitimacy of the activity and users. Much work on intrusion detection has focused on analysing the actions triggered by users, determining that atypical or disallowed actions may represent unauthorised use. It is also feasible to observe the users' own behaviour to see if they are acting in their'usual' way, reporting on any sufficiently-aberrant behaviour. Doing this requires a user profile, a feature found more often in marketing and education, but increasingly in security contexts. In this paper, we survey literature on intrusion detection and prevention systems from the viewpoint of exploiting the behaviour of the user in the context of their user profile to confirm or deny the legitimacy of their presence on the system (i.e. review of intrusion detection and prevention systems aimed at user profiling). User behaviour can be measured with both behavioural biometrics, such as keystroke speeds or mouse use, but also psychometrics which measure higher-order cognitive functions such as language and preferences.}

Among the most significant research difficulties in such networks safety is intrusion detection, whose target is to distinguish between misuse and abnormal behavior so as to ensure secure, reliable network operations and services. Intrusion detection is best delivered by multi-agent system technologies and advanced computing techniques. To date, diverse soft computing and machine learning techniques in terms of computational intelligence have been utilized to create Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS), yet the literature does not report any state-of-the-art reviews investigating the performance and consequences of such techniques solving wireless environment intrusion recognition issues as they gain entry into cloud computing. The principal contribution of this paper is a review and categorization of existing IDPS schemes in terms of traditional artificial computational intelligence with a multi-agent support. The significance of the techniques and methodologies and their performance and limitations are additionally analyzed in this study, and the limitations are addressed as challenges to obtain a set of requirements for IDPS in establishing a collaborative-based wireless IDPS (Co-WIDPS) architectural design. It amalgamates a fuzzy reinforcement learning knowledge management by creating a far superior technological platform that is far more accurate in detecting attacks. In conclusion, we elaborate on several key future research topics with the potential to accelerate the progress and deployment of computational intelligence based Co-WIDPSs.}

In this work, we propose an unsupervised approach, dual feature extraction network (DFEN) for HAD, to gradually build up ever-greater discrimination between the original data and background. In particular, we impose an end-to-end discriminative learning loss on two networks. Among them, adversarial learning aims to keep the original spectrum while Gaussian constrained learning intends to learn the background distribution in the potential space. To extract the anomaly, we calculate spatial and spectral anomaly scores based on mean squared error (MSE) spatial distance and orthogonal projection divergence (OPD) spectral distance between two latent feature matrices. Finally, the comprehensive detection result is obtained by a simple dot product between two domains to further reduce the false alarm rate. Experiments have been conducted on eight real hyperspectral data sets captured by different sensors over different scenes, which show that the proposed DFEN method is superior to other compared methods in detection accuracy or false alarm rate.}

abstract = {A Spam Transaction attack is a kind of hostile attack activity specifically targeted against a Cryptocurrency Network. Traditional network intrusion detection methods lack the capability of automatic feature extraction for spam transaction attacks, and thus the detection efficiency is low. Worse still, these kinds of attack methods and the key intrusion behaviour process are usually concealed and submerged into a large number of normal data packages; therefore, the captured threat test samples are too small, which easily leads to insufficient training of detection model, low detection accuracy rate, and high false alarm rate. In this paper, a spam transaction intrusion detection model based on GRU(Gated Recurrent Unit) is proposed, which takes advantage of the excellent features of deep learning and uses repeated and multilevel learning to perform automatic feature extraction for network intrusion behaviour. The model has extremely high learning ability and massive data processing ability. Moreover, it has a quicker and more accurate spam transaction attack detection ability than traditional intrusion detection algorithms. Additionally, a generation method of spam transaction-samples based on WGAN-div is proposed, which obtains new samples by learning training samples and solves the problems of insufficient original samples and unbalanced samples. A series of experiments were performed to verify the proposed models. The proposed models can distinguish between normal and abnormal transaction behaviours with an accuracy reaching to 99.86%. The experimental results indicate that the proposed models in this paper have higher efficiency and accuracy in detecting spam transaction attacks, which provides a novel and better idea for research of spam transaction attack detection systems.}

However, information sharing in a zero trust environment is more challenging, in comparison to an environment where we can rely on some trusted third-party. To address this challenge, we propose a blockchain-enabled zero trust information sharing protocol that is able to support the filtering of fabricated information and protect participant privacy during information sharing. We then prove the security of our protocol in the universally composable secure framework, and also evaluate its performance using a series of experiments. The evaluation results show that the average execution times of the three key steps in our protocol are 0.059 s, 0.060 s and 0.032 s, which demonstrates its potential for deployment in a real-world setting.}

Smart traffic control enables operators to decrease traffic congestion and environmental impact by acquiring real-time traffic data and changing traffic signals from fixed to adaptive schedules. However, these capabilities have inadvertently exposed traffic control to a wide range of cyber-attacks, which adversaries can easily mount through wireless networks or even through the Internet. Indeed, recent studies have found that a large number of traffic signals that are deployed in practice suffer from exploitable vulnerabilities, which adversaries may use to take control of the devices. Thanks to the hardware-based failsafes that most devices employ, adversaries cannot cause traffic accidents directly by setting compromised signals to dangerous configurations. Nonetheless, an adversary could cause disastrous traffic congestion by changing the schedule of compromised traffic signals, thereby effectively crippling the transportation network. To provide theoretical foundations for the protection of transportation networks from these attacks, we introduce a game-theoretic model of launching, detecting, and mitigating attacks that tamper with traffic-signal schedules. We show that finding optimal strategies is a computationally challenging problem, and we propose efficient heuristic algorithms for finding near optimal strategies. We also introduce a Gaussian-process based anomaly detector, which can alert operators to ongoing attacks. Finally, we evaluate our algorithms and the proposed detector using numerical experiments based on the SUMO traffic simulator.}

However, in the aftermath of a data breach by Facebook in 2018, there are some serious concerns over user data privacy and security being used to train the Machine Learning models. In this context, a new approach, Federated Machine Learning is now one of the most talked-about and recent approaches. Current research primarily focuses on Federated Learning's advantages over the traditional methods and/or its classification. However, being in a nascent stage of development as a method, certain challenges need to be addressed. This paper intends to address the totality of federated learning with a complete vulnerability assessment. During the study of the literature, it is found that security being promised as one of the key advantages of federated learning can still not be guaranteed because of some issues inherently present, and this can lead to poisoning, inference attacks and insertion of backdoors, etc. This paper intends to provide a complete picture by giving an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of Federated Learning and its taxonomy. It also provides a detailed vulnerability assessment and highlights the challenges faced in the current setting and future research directions to make federated learning a more functional, robust and secure method to train machine learning models.}

abstract = {The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), also known as Industry 4.0, empowers manufacturing and production processes by leveraging automation and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. In IIoT, the information communication technologies enabled by IoT could greatly improve the efficiency and timeliness of information exchanges between both vertical and horizontal system integrations. Likewise, machine learning algorithms, particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), are viable for assisting in automated control of complex IIoT systems, with the support of distributed edge computing infrastructure. Despite noticeable performance improvements, the security threats brought by massive interconnections in IoT and the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks used in DRL must be thoroughly investigated and mitigated before widespread deployment. Thus, in this paper we first design a DRL-based controller that could be deployed at edge computing server to enable automated control in an IIoT context. We then investigate malicious behaviors of adversaries with two attacks: (i) function-based attacks that can be launched during training phase and (ii) performance-based attacks that can be launched after training phase, to study the security impacts of vulnerable DRL-based controllers. From the adversary’s perspective, maximum entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is used to approximate a reward function through observation of system trajectories under the control of trained DRL-based controllers. The approximated reward function is then used to launch attacks by the adversary against the Deep Q Network (DQN)-based controller. Via simulation, we evaluate the impacts of our two investigated attacks, finding that attacks are increasingly successful with increasing accuracy of the control model. Furthermore, we discuss some tradeoffs between control performance and security performance of DRL-based IIoT controllers, and outline several future research directions to secure machine learning use in IIoT systems.}

abstract = {This paper introduces a malware detection system for smartphones based on studying the dynamic behavior of suspicious applications. The main goal is to prevent the installation of the malicious software on the victim systems. The approach focuses on identifying malware addressed against the Android platform. For that purpose, only the system calls performed during the boot process of the recently installed applications are studied. Thereby the amount of information to be considered is reduced, since only activities related with their initialization are taken into account. The proposal defines a pattern recognition system with three processing layers: monitoring, analysis and decision-making. First, in order to extract the sequences of system calls, the potentially compromised applications are executed on a safe and isolated environment. Then the analysis step generates the metrics required for decision-making. This level combines sequence alignment algorithms with bagging, which allow scoring the similarity between the extracted sequences considering their regions of greatest resemblance. At the decision-making stage, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is implemented, which determines if the new software is labeled as legitimate or malicious. The proposal has been tested in different experiments that include an in-depth study of a particular use case, and the evaluation of its effectiveness when analyzing samples of well-known public datasets. Promising experimental results have been shown, hence demonstrating that the approach is a good complement to the strategies of the bibliography.}

As an extension of the cloud, the emerging edge computing with rich resources provides us a new venue to design and deploy novel security solutions for IoT applications. Although there are some research efforts in this area, edge-based security designs for IoT applications are still in its infancy. This paper aims to present a comprehensive survey of existing IoT security solutions at the edge layer as well as to inspire more edge-based IoT security designs. We first present an edge-centric IoT architecture. Then, we extensively review the edge-based IoT security research efforts in the context of security architecture designs, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, authentication and authorization protocols, and privacy-preserving mechanisms.

Among them, several systems exploit Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition techniques, by regarding malicious behavior detection as a classification problem. Supervised and unsupervised algorithms have been used in this context, each one with its own benefits and shortcomings. When using supervised techniques, a representative training set is required, which reliably indicates what a human expert wants the system to learn and recognize, by means of suitably labeled samples. In real environments there is a significant difficulty in collecting a representative dataset of correctly labeled traffic traces. In adversarial environments such a task is made even harder by malicious attackers, trying to make their actions’ evidences stealthy. In order to overcome this problem, a self-training system is presented in this paper, building a dataset of labeled network traffic based on raw tcpdump traces and no prior knowledge on data. Results on both emulated and real traffic traces have shown that intrusion detection systems trained on such a dataset perform as well as the same systems trained on correctly hand-labeled data.}

abstract = {Most organizations today use cloud-computing environments and virtualization technology. Linux-based clouds are the most popular cloud environments among organizations, and thus have become the target of cyber-attacks launched by sophisticated malware. Existing malware detection solutions for Linux-based VMs are installed and operated on the VM itself and are considered untrusted since malware can detect, interfere with, and even evade them. Thus, Linux cloud-based environments remain exposed to various malware-based attacks. This paper presents the first trusted framework for detecting unknown malware in Linux VM cloud-environments. Our framework acquires volatile memory dumps from the inspected VM by querying the hypervisor in a trusted manner and overcoming malware’s ability to detect the security mechanism and evade detection. Then, using machine-learning algorithms we leverage informative traces (our 171 proposed features) from different parts of the VM’s volatile memory. The framework was evaluated in seven rigorous experiments, on a total of 21,800 volatile memory dumps taken from two widely used virtual servers (10,900 from each server) during the execution of a diverse yet representative collection of benign and malicious Linux applications. Notably, the results show that our proposed framework can accurately (with high TPRs and low FPRs): (a) detect unknown malware (b) detect new unknown malware from unseen malware categories, which is a critical ability for coping with new malware trends and phenomena; (c) categorize an unknown malware by its attack category; (d) detect unknown malware on an unknown virtual-server; and lastly (e) detect fileless malware, a critical capability demonstrating the ability to detect substantially different attack modus operandi.}

Signature-based deep search solutions only give accurate results if the threat artifacts are precisely provided. With the burgeoning variety of sophisticated cyber threats having common attack patterns and utilizing the same attack tools, a timely investigation is nearly impossible. There is a need to automate the threat analysis process by mapping adversary’s Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) to attack goals and detection mechanisms. In this paper, a novel machine learning based framework is proposed that identifies cyber threats based on observed attack patterns. The framework semantically relates threats and TTPs extracted from well-known threat sources with associated detection mechanisms to form a semantic network. This network is then used to determine threat occurrences by forming probabilistic relationships between threats and TTPs. The framework is trained using a TTP taxonomy dataset and the performance is evaluated with threat artifacts reported in threat reports. The framework efficiently identifies attacks with 92% accuracy and low false positives even in the case of lost and spurious TTPs. The average detection time of a data breach incident is 0.15 s for a network trained with 133 TTPs from 45 threat families.}

In order to automatically analyze attack preferences of intruders, this paper proposes a novel framework, namely HinAp, to predict cyber attack preference using attributed heterogeneous attention network and transductive learning. Particularly, we first build an attributed heterogeneous information network (AHIN) of attack events to model attackers, vulnerabilities, exploited scripts, compromised devices, invaded platforms, and 20 types of meta-paths describing interdependent relationships among them, in which attribute information of vulnerabilities and exploited scripts are embedded. Then, we propose the attack preference prediction model based on attention mechanism and transductive learning, respectively. Finally, an automated model for predicting cyber attack preferences is constructed by stacking these two basic prediction models, which capable of integrating more comprehensive and complex semantic information from meta-paths and meta-graphs to characterize attack preference of intruders. Experimental results based on real-world data prove that HinAp outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in predicting cyber attack preferences of intruders.}

Though the recent research works focus on developing proficient cybersecurity mechanisms, they often fail to address the major challenges such as handling the unseen zero-day exploits and detecting data irregularities that result in a poor attack detection rate. Hence to address the aforementioned challenges, this research article proposes an intelligent multi-level intrusion detection system to detect data-abnormalities in process-control network packets. The proposed approach involves the following phases: (i) Bloom-filter based payload level detection, (ii) partition-based Kohonen mapping for learning abnormal data patterns using a deep version of Kohonen neural network enhanced by principal component analysis and partitioning property of Hypergraph, and (iii) BLOSOM – a hybrid anomaly detection model. The impact of the proposed approach has been validated with the high-dimensional and heterogeneous benchmark datasets obtained from Mississippi State University (Gas-pipeline dataset) and Singapore University of Technology and Design (Secure WAter Treatment dataset). The proposed approach outscores the existing State-of-the-art approaches in terms of Precision, Recall, F-Score & Classification Accuracy and found to be robust, scalable & computationally attractive.}

The agricultural UAVs combined with IoT use an open channel i.e., the Internet to assist cultivators with data collection, processing, monitoring, and making correct decisions on the farm. However, the use of the Internet opens up a wide range of challenges such as security (e.g., performing cyber-attacks), risk of data privacy (e.g., data poisoning and inference attacks), etc. The usage of current conventional centralized security measures has limitations in terms of a single point of failure, verifiability, traceability, and scalability. Motivated from the aforementioned challenges, we propose a Secured Privacy-Preserving Framework (SP2F) for smart agricultural UAVs. The proposed SP2F framework has two main engines, a two-level privacy engine, and a deep learning-based anomaly detection engine. In the two-level privacy engine, a blockchain, and smart contract-based enhanced Proof of Work (ePoW) is designed for data authentication, and to mitigate data poisoning attacks. A Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE) is applied for transforming data into a new encoded format for preventing inference attacks. In the anomaly detection engine, a Stacked Long-Short-Term Memory (SLSTM) is used to train and evaluate the results of the proposed two-level privacy engine using two publicly accessible IoT-based datasets, namely ToN-IoT and IoT Botnet. Finally, based on thorough analysis, and comparison, we identify that the SP2F framework outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in both non-blockchain and blockchain frameworks.}

With more medical devices being connected in industry, the security of medical cyber–physical systems has received much attention. Medical smartphones are one of the widely adopted facilities in the healthcare industry aiming to improve the quality of service for both patients and healthcare personnel. These devices construct an emerging CPS network architecture, called medical smartphone networks (MSNs). Similar to other distributed networks, MSNs also suffer from insider attacks, where the intruders have authorized access to the network resources, resulting in the leakage of patient information. In this work, we focus on the detection of malicious devices in MSNs and design a trust-based intrusion detection approach based on behavioral profiling. A node’s reputation can be judged by identifying the difference in Euclidean distance between two behavioral profiles. In the evaluation, we evaluate our approach in a real MSN environment by collaborating with a practical healthcare center.

Modern SCADA systems have evolved from standalone systems into sophisticated, complex, open systems connected to the Internet. This geographically distributed modern SCADA system is more vulnerable to threats and cyber attacks than traditional SCADA. Traditional SCADA systems were less exposed to Internet threats as they operated on isolated networks. Over the years, an increase in the number of cyber-attacks against the SCADA systems seeks security researchers’ attention towards their security. In this review paper, we first review the SCADA system architectures and comparative analysis of proposed/implemented communication protocols, followed by attacks on such systems to understand and highlight the evolving security needs for SCADA systems. A short investigation of the current state of intrusion detection techniques in SCADA systems is done, followed by a brief study of testbeds for SCADA systems. The cloud and Internet of things (IoT) based SCADA systems are studied by analyzing modern SCADA systems’ architecture.

The goal of online learning is to maximize the accuracy/correctness for the sequence of predictions/decisions made by the online learner given the knowledge of correct answers to previous prediction/learning tasks and possibly additional information. This is in contrast to traditional batch or offline machine learning methods that are often designed to learn a model from the entire training data set at once.

This survey aims to provide a comprehensive survey of the online machine learning literature through a systematic review of basic ideas and key principles and a proper categorization of different algorithms and techniques. Generally speaking, according to the types of learning tasks and the forms of feedback information, the existing online learning works can be classified into three major categories: (i) online supervised learning where full feedback information is always available, (ii) online learning with limited feedback, and (iii) online unsupervised learning where no feedback is available.

The academic literature, however, is largely silent on post-audit of such investments, which is a formal evaluation of IT resource allocation decisions. IT post-audits are considered a useful risk management tool for organizations and are often emphasized in security certifications and standards. To fill this research gap and contribute to practice, we suggest post-auditing of IT security investments using the generic Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation approach. This approach does not place stringent conjugate assumptions and can handle high-dimensional Bayesian post-audit inference problems often associated with information security resource allocation decisions. We develop two Bayesian post-audit models using the MCMC method: (1) measuring the effectiveness of an IT security investment using posterior mean score ratios (MSR), and posterior crossover error rates (CER); and (2) measuring the effectiveness through detection of a denial of service (DOS) attack using Bayesian estimation to statistically compare the degree of divergence using the concept of entropy. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed methodology using an email intrusion detection system application.}

In this paper we provide two primary contributions to the security evaluation literature—a representative survey, and a novel framework for evaluating security that is flexible, applicable to all three use cases, and readily interpretable. In our survey of the literature we identify the distinct themes from each community’s evaluation procedures side by side and flesh out the drawbacks and benefits of each. The evaluation framework we propose includes comprehensively modeling the resource, labor, and attack costs in dollars incurred based on expected resource usage, accuracy metrics, and time. This framework provides a unified approach in that it incorporates the accuracy and performance metrics, which dominate intrusion detection evaluation, the time to detection and impact to data and resources of an attack, favored by educational competitions’ metrics, and the monetary cost of many essential security components used in financial analysis. Moreover, it is flexible enough to accommodate each use case, easily interpretable and comparable, and comprehensive in terms of costs considered. Finally, we provide two examples of the framework applied to real-world use cases. Overall, we provide a survey and a grounded, flexible framework with multiple concrete examples for evaluating security which can address the needs of three currently distinct communities.}

abstract = {Robustness of federated learning has become one of the major concerns since some Byzantine adversaries, who may upload false data owning to unreliable communication channels, corrupted hardware or even malicious attacks, might be concealed in the group of the distributed worker. Meanwhile, it has been proved that membership attacks and reverse attacks against federated learning can lead to privacy leakage of the training data. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a privacy-preserving Byzantine-robust federated learning scheme (PBFL) which takes both the robustness of federated learning and the privacy of the workers into account. PBFL is constructed from an existing Byzantine-robust federated learning algorithm and combined with distributed Paillier encryption and zero-knowledge proof to guarantee privacy and filter out anomaly parameters from Byzantine adversaries. Finally, we prove that our scheme provides a higher level of privacy protection compared to the previous Byzantine-robust federated learning algorithms.}

abstract = {In the context of future networking technologies, Software-Defined paradigm offers compelling solutions and advantages for traffic orchestration and shaping, flexible and dynamic routing, programmable control and smart application-driven resource management. But the SDN operation has to confront critical issues and technical vulnerabilities, security problems and threats in the enabling technical architecture itself. To address the critical security problems in SDN enabled data centers, we propose a collaborative “Network Security and Intrusion Detection System(NIDS)” scheme called ‘VARMAN: adVanced multi-plAne secuRity fraMework for softwAre defined Networks’. The SDN security scheme comprises of coarse-grained flow monitoring algorithms on the dataplane for rapid anomaly detection and prediction of network-centric DDoS/botnet attacks. In addition, this is combined with a fine-grained hybrid deep-learning based classifier pipeline on the control plane. It is observed that existing ML-based classifiers improve the accuracy of NIDS, however, at the cost of higher processing power and memory requirement, thus unrealistic for real-time solutions. To address these problems and still achieve accuracy and speed, we designed a hybrid model, combining both deep and shallow learning techniques, that are implemented in an improved SDN stack. The data plane deploys attack prediction and behavioral trigger mechanisms, efficient data filtering, feature selection, and data reduction techniques. To demonstrate the practical feasibility of our security scheme in real modern datacenters, we utilized the popular NSL-KDD dataset, most recent CICIDS2017 dataset, and refined it to a balanced dataset containing a comparable number of normal traffic and malware samples. We further augmented the training by organically generating datasets from lab-simulated and public-network hosted hackathon websites. The results show that VARMAN framework is capable of detecting attacks in real-time with accuracy more than 98% under attack intensities up to 50k packets/second. In a multi-controller interconnected SDN domain, the flow setup time improves by 70% on an average, and controller response time reduces by 40%, without incurring additional latency due to security intelligence processing overhead in SDN stack. The comparisons of VARMAN under similar attack scenarios and test environment, with related recent works that utilized ML-based NIDS, demonstrate that our scheme offers higher accuracy, less than 5% false positive rate for various attack intensities and significant training space/time reduction.}

abstract = {The number of devices connected to the Internet is increasing day by day. This increase causes cyber-attacks to be larger and more complex. It is important to sdetect the anomalies rapidly when there is a cyber-attack. In detecting anomalies, high false positive rate is obtained by using feature extraction based on statistical calculations and machine learning algorithms. In proposed approach, the measured values obtained from the network are normalized between 0 and 1. These values applied to autoencoder model trained with optimum hyper parameters. This model contributes to feature learning and dimensional reduction. Support vector machines effectively differentiate between normal and DDOS attack traffic by using these features. The CICIDS dataset and virtually generated DDOS traffic are used to validate the proposed approach and measure its performance. The results show that the proposed approach speeds up training and testing times and performs better classification performance metrics than most previous approaches. The novelty of the study is that AE-SVM trained with CICIDS successfully captures virtually generated DDOS traffic data. Despite the unbalanced data set, 99.1% test success was achieved in detection of DDOS traffic which is produced with Kali Linux. This success contributed to the solution of the high false-positive problem compared to other models.}

abstract = {With the continuous modernization of water plants, malicious, often state-sponsored attacks continue to create havoc in such critical realms. Motivated by this, this paper proposes an unsupervised data-driven approach to support cyber forensics in such unique setups. Specifically, the proposed approach aims at inferring and attributing cyber attacks using sensor readings and actuators states. The approach operates using attack-free data, which is attractive towards cyber forensics of such systems, where attack-related empirical data is rarely widely available due to security and privacy reasons. The proposed method also provides the capability to track and identify the attacked assets for prioritization purposes. The proposed approach exploits Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiGAN) to fingerprint the behavior of the system under regular operation. It employs a combination of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as a basis of its design components. The Energy Distance (ED) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) are used to evaluate how firmly the model has learned the system's behavior. The approach also leverages the l1-norm distance between unseen data and corresponding reconstruction to estimate the irregularity score representing cyber attacks. The relative importance of the obtained residual error for each sensor/actuator is put forward to attribute the attacked assets. To this end, we independently employ a regression tree technique, a game-theoretic concept known as Shapley values, and a model-wise approach, the KernelSHAP, as residual loss to identify the relation of each asset to the inferred anomaly. The results are then amalgamated to pinpoint the attacked asset. Empirical evaluations using data collected in a testbed representing a small-scale water treatment plant uncovered 32 out of the 36 cyber incidents; exceeding the performance of state-of-the-art. We also show that the proposed approach identifies the exploited sensors/actuators with more than 8–15% accuracy improvement over current available works. We postulate and stress the fact that such proposed methods significantly contributes towards the forensics of critical infrastructure.}

It is used nowadays in different domains and applications such as pattern recognition, medical prediction, and speech recognition. Differently from traditional learning algorithms, deep learning can overcome the dependency on hand-designed features. Deep learning experience is particularly improved by leveraging powerful infrastructures such as clouds and adopting collaborative learning for model training. However, this comes at the expense of privacy, especially when sensitive data are processed during the training and the prediction phases, as well as when training model is shared. In this paper, we provide a review of the existing privacy-preserving deep learning techniques, and propose a novel multi-level taxonomy, which categorizes the current state-of-the-art privacy-preserving deep learning techniques on the basis of privacy-preserving tasks at the top level, and key technological concepts at the base level. This survey further summarizes evaluation results of the reviewed solutions with respect to defined performance metrics. In addition, it derives a set of learned lessons from each privacy-preserving task. Finally, it highlights open research challenges and provides some recommendations as future research directions.}

A signature-based WAF responds to threats through the implementation of application-specific rules which block malicious traffic. However, these rules must be continually adapted to address evolving threats. The resultant rules can become complex and difficult to maintain, requiring that the administrator possesses a high-level of skills and detailed knowledge of the application. Not to mention the challenges of zero-day attacks! A WAF can deliver high rates of false positives and false negatives that can adversely impact the performance and can provide poor protection against zero-day attacks. This paper aims to provide a short review showing the development of WAFs based on machine-learning-based methods. It discusses their merits and limitations as well as identifying open issues. It assesses which of them can provide countermeasures to zero-day attacks and are easy to configure and maintain to keep them up to date. It was found that machine-learning-based methods have advantages over signature/rule-based methods as the former can address the vulnerability to zero-day attacks and can be easier to configure and keep up to date. The survey also determined that the effectiveness of machine-learning-based WAFs in protecting current attack patterns targeting web application frameworks is still an open area for further investigation.}

Most of the time, the timely and accurate detection of video anomalies is the main objective of security applications. The video anomalies such as anomalous activities and anomalous entities are defined as the abnormal or irregular patterns present in the video that do not conform to the normal trained patterns. Anomalous activities such as fighting, riots, traffic rule violations, and stampede as well as anomalous entities such as weapons at the sensitive place and abandoned luggage should be detected automatically in time. However, the detection of video anomalies is challenging due to the ambiguous nature of the anomaly, various environmental conditions, the complex nature of human behaviors, and the lack of proper datasets. There are only a few dedicated surveys related to deep learning-based video anomaly detection as the research domain is in its early stages. However, state of the art lacks a review that provides a comprehensive study covering all the aspects such as definitions, classifications, modelings, performance evaluation methodologies, open and trending research challenges of video anomaly detection. Hence, in this survey, we present a comprehensive study of the deep learning-based methods reported in state of the art to detect the video anomalies. Further, we discuss the comparative analysis of the state of the art methods in terms of datasets, computational infrastructure, and performance metrics for both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Finally, we outline the challenges and promising directions for further research.}

Past research on detection of P2P botnets has frequently used machine learning algorithms to build detection models. However, most prior work lacks the evaluation of such detection models in the presence of deliberate injection of noise by an adversary. Furthermore, detection of P2P botnets in the presence of benign P2P traffic has received little attention from the research community. This work proposes a novel approach for the detection of stealthy P2P botnets (in presence of benign P2P traffic) using conversation-based mechanisms and new features based on Fourier transforms and information entropy. We use real-world botnet data to compare the performance of our features with traditional ‘flow-based’ features employed by past research, and demonstrate that our approach is more resilient towards the injection of noise in the communication patterns by an adversary. We build detection models with multiple supervised machine learning algorithms. With our approach, we could detect P2P botnet traffic in the presence of injected noise with True Positive rate as high as 90%.}

Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, in this paper, we explored Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)-based models and techniques which are capable off to identify and mitigate both the known as well as unknown attacks. ML and DL-based techniques have the capabilities to learn from the traffic pattern using training and testing datasets in the extensive network domains to make intelligent decisions concerning attack identification and mitigation.

The performance of FR systems has improved by orders of magnitude over the past decade. This is mainly due to the latest developments in computer vision and deep convolutional neural networks, and the availability of large training datasets. At the same time, these systems have been subject to various types of attacks. Presentation attacks are common, simple, and easy to implement. These simply involve presenting a video, photo, or mask to the camera or digital sensor and have proven capable of fooling FR systems and providing access to unauthorised users. Presentation attack detection is increasingly attracting more attention in the research community. A wide range of methods has already been developed to address this challenge. Deep learning-based methods in particular have shown very promising results. However, existing literature suggests that even with state-of-the-art methods, performance drops significantly in cross-dataset evaluation. We present a thorough, comprehensive, and technical review of existing literature on this timely and challenging problem. We first introduce and discuss the presentation attack problem and cover related and recent work in this area. In-depth technical details of existing presentation attack detection methods are then presented and critically discussed and evaluated, followed by a comprehensive discussion and evaluation of existing public datasets and commonly used evaluation metrics. Our review shows clearly that despite the recent and significant advances in this area of research, detecting unseen attacks is still considered a key problem. Machine learning methods tend to perform well, but only when test data comes from the same distribution as the training data (i.e. same dataset). New research directions are discussed in detail, including ways to improve the generalisation of machine learning methods, and move towards creating more stable presentation attack detection techniques that generalise across a wide range of unseen samples.}

Most of such advanced malwares are highly persistent and capable of escaping from the security systems. This paper explores such an advanced malware type called Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). APTs pave the way for most of the Cyber espionages and sabotages. APTs are highly sophisticated, target specific and operate in a stealthy mode till the target is compromised. The intention of the APTs is to deploy target specific automated malwares in a host or network to initiate an on-demand attack based on continuous monitoring. Encrypted covert communication and advanced, sophisticated attack techniques make the identification of APTs more challenging. Conventional security systems like antivirus, anti-malware systems which depend on signatures and static analysis fail to identify these APTs. The Advanced Evasive Techniques (AET) used in APTs are capable of bypassing the stateful firewalls housed in the enterprise choke points at ease. Hence, this paper presents a detailed study on sophisticated attack and evasion techniques used by the contemporary malwares. Furthermore, existing malware analysis techniques, application hardening techniques and CPU assisted application security schemes are also discussed. Finally, the study concludes by presenting the System and Network Security Design (SNSD) using existing mitigation techniques.}

In recent years, the number of cyber-attacks to industrial control networks are growing increasingly. Moreover, connecting industrial networks to the public network makes these critical infrastructures more vulnerable to the cyber-attacks. Therefore, improving the security of these networks has attracted much attention nowadays. To protect industrial control networks, the proposed online method is able to detect anomalies with low computational time while do not use prior knowledge about the system and anomalies. This method can adjust the severity of detection in order to efficiently detect changes which lead to anomalies; And also can be adapted to inevitable network changes by updating the anomaly threshold using the latest normal states. The proposed method finds anomalies in the network using high-pass filters and Euclidean distance of the current state with the latest states. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach, a boiler control system is simulated and three test datasets are provided from this simulation. The proposed intrusion detection system was evaluated through these datasets, as well as the SWaT dataset. The results show that the proposed approach not only is highly effective for detecting anomalies, but also is adaptable to the normal variations in the network.}

abstract = {The increasing popularity and widespread use of Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) technologies have produced a significant need for the integration of cloud and edge computing with distributed detection solutions to handle the growing volume of distributed security threats. While deep learning-based approaches have been used to detect anomalous behaviors in complex data patterns, the heterogeneity in IoT networks still poses paramount challenges to update synchronization across learning nodes in distributed training. Particularly, the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data patterns over remote nodes significantly affect the performance of model training provisioned on cloud and edge computing servers, and most existing works have assumed a homogeneous setting. The heterogeneity brings the gradient delay problem, causing the gradient inconsistency in the barrier-free asynchronous mode. In this paper, we propose a Delay Compensated Adam (DC-Adam) approach, an asynchronous federated learning-based detection approach, for IoT devices with limited resources. To overcome the notorious gradient delay problem, we develop a Taylor Expansion-based scheme to compensate for the inconsistency caused by asynchronous communication. Moreover, a pre-shared data training strategy for non-IID data is developed to avoid the convergence divergence under the non-IID patterns. After the collaborative model training procedure, we append an additional local training process at each client to fit respective patterns. Via a combination of theoretical analysis of convergence and practical experimental results, we validate the efficacy of our proposed approach compared to the other state-of-the-art approaches. Compared with benchmark approaches, we demonstrate that our proposed method can converge stably, and that it outperforms the barrier-free asynchronous federated learning by 12.8% (accuracy), 14% (precision). 8.71% (recall), and 11.16% (F1 score) on average.}

In this paper, we study the evasive behaviors employed by malware authors to hide the malicious activity of samples and hinder security analysis. First, we collect and systematize 92 evasive techniques leveraged by Windows malware to detect and thwart instrumented environments (e.g., debuggers and virtual machines). Then, we implement a framework for evasion analysis and analyze 45,375 malware samples observed in the wild between 2010 and 2019; we compare this analysis against popular, legitimate Windows programs to study the intrinsic characteristics of such evasive behaviors. Based on the results of our experiments, we present statistics about the adoption of evasive techniques and their evolution over time. We show that over the past 10 years, the prevalence of evasive malware samples had a slight increase (12%). Moreover, the employed techniques shifted significantly over time. We also identify techniques that are specific to malware, as opposed to being employed by both malicious and legitimate software. Finally, we study how the security community reacts to the deployment of new evasive techniques. Overall, our results empirically address open research questions and provide insights and directions for future research.}

Internet is the main media to execute the malware attack on the computer systems through emails, malicious websites and by drive and download software. Malicious software can be a virus, trojan horse, worms, rootkits, adware or ransomware. Malware and benign samples are analyzed using static or dynamic analysis techniques. After analysis unique features are extracted to distinguish the malware and benign files. The efficiency of the malware detection system depends on how effectively discriminative malware features are extracted through the analysis techniques. There are various methods to set up the analysis environments using various static and dynamic tools. The second phase is to train the malware classifiers. Earlier traditional methods were used but nowadays machine learning algorithms are used for malware classification which can cope with complexity and pace of malware development. In this paper detailed study of malware detection techniques using machine learning algorithms are presented. In addition, this paper discusses various challenges for developing malware classifiers.

IDS provide information about the intrusive activities on a network through alerts, which security analysts manually evaluate to execute an intrusion response plan. However, one of the downsides of IDS is the large amount of alerts they raise, which makes the manual investigation of alerts a burdensome and error-prone task. In this work, we propose an approach to facilitate the investigation of huge amounts of intrusion alerts. The approach applies process mining techniques on alerts to extract information regarding the attackers behavior and the multi-stage attack strategies they adopted. The strategies are presented to the network administrator in friendly high-level visual models. Large and visually complex models that are difficult to understand are clustered into smaller, simpler and intuitive models using hierarchical clustering techniques. To evaluate the proposed approach, a real dataset of alerts from a large public University in the United States was used. We find that security visualization models created with process mining and hierarchical clustering are able to condense a huge number of alerts and provide insightful information for network/IDS administrators. For instance, by analyzing the models generated during the case study, network administrators could find out important details about the attack strategies such as attack frequencies and targeted network services.}

With the emerging Industry 4.0 environment, legacy PLCs are now connected to the Internet to be better automated.

In this paper, we discuss various vulnerabilities in these PLCs. We describe threat models, detection and protection techniques. We consider vulnerabilities as compromised PLC logic, which is introduced by over-the-network malicious data injection. We leverage Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) techniques, such as output value comparison using majority voting, timing comparison and using known I/O values for detecting such attacks for our Network-Based Intrusion Detection System for PLCs. We mimic functionalities of PLCs, through virtualization of PLCs’ ladder logic on OpenPLC [7]. We use a record & replay technique for attack mitigation and system restoration. The record & replay system captures pin values of a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) signal with sensitivity of 50 microseconds. We implement the attacks and our proposed security solution on the control flow logic of a sample industrial gas pipeline PLC network. We achieve a false positive rate of 1% along with a latency of 25 milliseconds in our abnormal detection with setting of 4 virtual PLCs (using OpenPLC [7]), and generated receiver operating characteristic results on different attack rates and ST file logic settings.}

ICSs are often found in the industrial sectors and critical infrastructures, such as nuclear and thermal plants, water treatment facilities, power generation, heavy industries, and distribution systems. Though ICSs were kept isolated from the Internet for so long, significant achievable business benefits are driving a convergence between ICSs and the Internet as well as information technology (IT) environments, such as cloud computing. As a result, ICSs have been exposed to the attack vectors used in the majority of cyber-attacks. However, ICS devices are inherently much less secure against such advanced attack scenarios. A compromise to ICS can lead to enormous physical damage and danger to human lives. In this work, we have a close look at the shift of the ICS from stand-alone systems to cloud-based environments. Then we discuss the major works, from industry and academia towards the development of the secure ICSs, especially applicability of the machine learning techniques for the ICS cyber-security. The work may help to address the challenges of securing industrial processes, particularly while migrating them to the cloud environments.}

abstract = {Cyber threat attribution identifies the source of a malicious cyber activity, which in turn informs cyber security mitigation responses and strategies. Such responses and strategies are crucial for deterring future attacks, particularly in the financial and critical infrastructure sectors. However, existing approaches generally rely on manual analysis of attack indicators obtained through approaches such as trace-back, firewalls, intrusion detection and honeypot deployments. These attack indicators, also known as low-level Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), are rarely re-used and can be easily modified and disguised resulting in a deceptive and biased cyber threat attribution. Cyber attackers, particularly financially-motivated actors, can use common high-level attack patterns that evolve less frequently as compared to the low-level IOCs. To attribute cyber threats effectively, it is necessary to identify them based on the high-level adversary’s attack patterns (e.g. tactics, techniques and procedures - TTPs, software tools and malware) employed in different phases of the cyber kill chain. Identification of high-level attack patterns is time-consuming, requiring forensic investigation of the victim network(s) and other resources. In the rare case that attack patterns are reported in cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports, the format is textual and unstructured typically taking the form of lengthy incident reports prepared for human consumption (e.g. prepared for C-level and senior management executives), which cannot be directly interpreted by machines. Thus, in this paper we propose a framework to automate cyber threat attribution. Specifically, we profile cyber threat actors (CTAs) based on their attack patterns extracted from CTI reports, using the distributional semantics technique of Natural Language Processing. Using these profiles, we train and test five machine learning classifiers on 327 CTI reports collected from publicly available incident reports that cover events from May 2012 to February 2018. It is observed that the CTA profiles obtained attribute cyber threats with a high precision (i.e. 83% as compared to other publicly available CTA profiles, where the precision is 33%). The Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN) based classifier also attributes cyber threats with a higher accuracy (i.e. 94% as compared to other classifiers).}

Performance improvements are a non-stop ambition and require tuning fine-grained details of the system operation. Analyzing such data deluge, however, is not straightforward and sometimes not supported by the system. There are often problems regarding scalability and the predisposition of the involved nodes to understand and transfer the data. This issue is at least partially circumvented by knowledge acquisition from past experiences, which is a characteristic of the herein called “challenged networks”. The addition of intelligence in these scenarios is fundamental to extract linear and non-linear relationships from the data collected by multiple sources. This is undoubtedly an invitation to machine learning and, more particularly, to deep learning. This paper identifies five different challenged networks: IoT and sensor, mobile, industrial, and vehicular networks as typical scenarios that may have multiple and heterogeneous data sources and face obstacles concerning connectivity. As a consequence, deep learning solutions can contribute to system performance by adding intelligence and the ability to interpret data. We start the paper by providing an overview of deep learning, further explaining this approach’s benefits over the cited scenarios. We propose a workflow based on our observations of deep learning applications over challenged networks, and based on it, we strive to survey the literature on deep-learning-based solutions at an application-oriented level using the PRISMA methodology. Afterward, we also discuss new deep learning techniques that show enormous potential for further improvements as well as transversal issues, such as security. Finally, we provide lessons learned raising trends linking all surveyed papers to deep learning approaches. We are confident that the proposed paper contributes to the state of the art and can be a piece of inspiration for beginners and also for enthusiasts on advanced networking research.}

Existing techniques suffer from high rates of false alarms, hindering large-scale deployment of anomaly detection techniques in commercial settings. Objective: To reduce the false alarm rate, we present a new anomaly detection system based on a novel feature extraction technique, which combines the frequency with the temporal information from system call traces, and on one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) detector.Method: The proposed feature extraction approach starts by segmenting the system call traces into multiple n-grams of variable length and mapping them to fixed-size sparse feature vectors, which are then used to train OC-SVM detectors.Results: The results achieved on a real-world system call dataset show that our feature vectors with up to 6-grams outperform the term vector models (using the most common weighting schemes) proposed in related work. More importantly, our anomaly detection system using OC-SVM with a Gaussian kernel, trained on our feature vectors, achieves a higher-level of detection accuracy (with a lower false alarm rate) than that achieved by Markovian and n-gram based models as well as by the state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques.Conclusion: The proposed feature extraction approach from traces of events provides new and general data representations that are suitable for training standard one-class machine learning algorithms, while preserving the temporal dependencies among these events.}

We consider attacks whose goals are to corrupt the state estimator and/or the operation of the power grid. By considering AC-based models of the state estimator and the operation of the power system, the proposed model allows quantifying the reliability consequences (i.e., alteration in the active and reactive power), and the economic consequences (e.g., distorting locational marginal prices) of such attacks. We consider a resource-constrained omniscient attacker intending to alter the operation of the power system. We impose a stealthy condition on the attacker so that its malicious action is invisible to the bad-data-detection algorithm. The upper-level problem of the proposed bilevel model represents the attacker’s action and pursues disrupting the system operation and it is constrained by two lower-level problems. The first lower-level problem is the state-estimation that calculates the most likely state of the system considering the corrupted measurement. The second lower-level problem is a conic relaxation of the optimal power flow that uses the output of the state estimation problem to minimize operation costs. We illustrate the proposed bilevel model using two test systems.}

abstract = {While traditional malware relies on executables to function, fileless malware resides in memory to evade traditional detection methods. PowerShell which is a legitimate management tool used by system administrators provides an ideal cover for attackers. Many studies attempted to detect unknown malware with machine learning techniques. However, there are a few studies for detecting malicious PowerShell. Previous studies proposed methods of detecting malicious PowerShell with deep neural networks. Previous methods require decoding obfuscated samples for dynamic code evaluation. Decoding obfuscated samples is a troublesome task and is often time consuming. Security devices such as intrusion detection system (IDS) or sandbox are located at a point that can monitor all inbound traffic. In general, this traffic contains too massive samples to analyze by dynamic analysis. Therefore, a light-weight static method is desirable. In addition, some studies use their private dataset to evaluate their methods. In this paper, we propose a static method of detecting malicious PowerShell based on word embeddings. In our method, PowerShell scripts are separated into words, and these words are used as features for machine learning techniques. We improved the feature extraction method by selecting frequent words. To provide reproducibility, we obtained thousands of samples from multiple websites which are publicly available. The best F1 score achieves 0.995 in practical environment, and achieves 0.985 in 5-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, we identified their malware families, and confirmed our method is effective to new ones.}

With increasing real-world applications of SVMs, malicious data that is classified as innocuous may have harmful consequences. This paper presents a novel framework that utilizes adversarial learning, nonlinear data projections, and game theory to improve the resilience of SVMs against such training-data-integrity attacks. The proposed approach introduces a layer of uncertainty through the use of random projections on top of the learners, making it challenging for the adversary to guess the specific configurations of the learners. To find appropriate projection directions, we introduce novel indices that ensure the contraction of the data and maximize the detection accuracy. Experiments with benchmark data sets show increases in detection rates up to 13.5% for OCSVMs and up to 14.1% for binary SVMs under different attack algorithms when compared with the respective base algorithms.}

In addition, virtual networks create highly dynamic and flexible environments which differ widely from well-known infrastructures of the past decade. Network forensic investigation that aims at the detection of covert channels, malware usage or anomaly detection is faced with new problems and is thus a time-consuming, error-prone and complex process. Machine learning provides advanced techniques to perform this work faster, more precise and, simultaneously, with fewer errors. Depending on the learning technique, algorithms work nearly without any interaction to detect relevant events in the transferred network packets. Current algorithms work well in static environments, but the highly dynamic environments of virtual networks create additional events which might confuse anomaly detection algorithms. This paper analyzes highly flexible networks and their inherent on-demand changes like the migration of virtual machines, SDN-programmability or user customization and the resulting effect on the detection rate of anomalies in the environment. Our research shows the need for adapted pre-processing of the network data and improved cooperation between IT security and IT administration departments.}

Darknet is an internet-based technology that builds on an encrypted network. Darknet networks can be accessed using a specific software with a specific network configuration; its content does not index by any search engines. Since its beginning, Darknet has been used for criminogenic tasks and applauded primarily for cybercrime promotion, including arms and drug dealing. Few countries have control over digital media and are ruled by a suppressive government. They have formulated strict policies for freedom fighters and journalism, using the Darknet anonymously. Also, many people use it for illegal purposes. Therefore, we have both positive and negative impacts of the darknet on human society and just cannot be discarded. However, in this paper, our prime concern emanates from the darknet network detection from the network traffic data through the deep transfer learning model. To provide a more accurate result, we transform time-based features into a three-dimensional image and then feed it into a pre-trained model for the extraction of promising features. In this study, we considered the DeepInsight method to transform the numerical features into image data. These features were then used in a proposed bi-level classification system to classify the input data into malicious activities. To identify the optimized pretrained network this paper utilized 10 pre-trained models: AlexNet, ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, DenseNet, GoogLeNet, VGG16, VGG19, Inceptionv3, and SqueezeNet with three different baseline classifiers, namely support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest. In addition to malicious activity prediction, the proposed model could also predict the type of traffic. The experiment results illustrate that the VGG19 based features along with random forest can classify the traffic data with 96% of accuracy.}

CAPTCHA is preferred to prevent bots in web applications to minimize possible risks. Although captcha applications make bot-user distinction, it can be solved with software-based systems. In addition, increasing the difficulty level of CAPTCHA schemes have bringing usage difficulties. In this study, a robust behavior-based CAPTCHA (UNI-CAPTCHA) was developed that detects user-bot without interaction with user. A web application with a landing page, login page, and register page has been developed for UNI-CAPTCHA to learn user and bot behavior. The application was tested with 16 different vulnerability tool bots and real users, creating a unique dataset containing 13 different behaviors. A risk rating was made using the k-Means++ algorithm based on characteristics of user behavior in the dataset. The trained hybrid bi-LSTM + Softmax based UNI-CAPTCHA engine intuitively performs user-bot labeling of requests from the web application simultaneously. It also determines the risk rating of user labels from 1 to 5. The threshold user value (εt) for high protection is determined in the evaluation, and results below εt, its value is evaluated as bot behavior and prevented. In UNI-Captcha, the threshold value of suspicious user behavior is adjusted according to the in-app security risk level. Analysis shows that the UNI-CAPTCHA engine shows better stability, speed, and detection than traditional bot detection and CAPTCHA applications.}

abstract = {Websites attract millions of visitors due to the convenience of services they offer, which provide for interesting targets for cyber attackers. Most of these websites use JavaScript (JS) to create dynamic content. The exploitation of vulnerabilities in servers, plugins, and other third-party systems enables the insertion of malicious codes into websites. These exploits use methods such as drive-by-downloads, pop up ads, and phishing attacks on news, porn, piracy, torrent or free software websites, among others. Many of the recent cyber-attacks exploit JS vulnerabilities, in some cases employing obfuscation to hide their maliciousness and evade detection. It is, therefore, primal to develop an accurate detection system for malicious JS to protect users from such attacks. This study adopts Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for code structure representation and a machine learning approach to conduct feature learning called Doc2vec to address this issue. Doc2vec is a neural network model that can learn context information of texts with variable length. This model is a well-suited feature learning method for JS codes, which consist of text content ranging among single line sentences, paragraphs, and full-length documents. Besides, features learned with Doc2Vec are of low dimensions which ensure faster detections. A classifier model judges the maliciousness of a JS code using the learned features. The performance of this approach is evaluated using the D3M dataset (Drive-by-Download Data by Marionette) for malicious JS codes and the JSUNPACK plus Alexa top 100 websites datasets for benign JS codes. We then compare the performance of Doc2Vec on plain JS codes (Plain-JS) and AST form of JS codes (AST-JS) to other feature learning methods. Our experimental results show that the proposed AST features and Doc2Vec for feature learning provide better accuracy and fast classification in malicious JS codes detection compared to conventional approaches and can flag malicious JS codes previously identified as hard-to-detect.}

However, security problems in cyberspace are becoming serious, and traditional defense measures (e.g., firewall, intrusion detection systems and security audit) often fall into a passive situation of being prone to attacks and difficult to take effect when responding to new types of network attacks with a higher and higher degree of coordination and intelligence. By constructing and implementing the diverse strategy of dynamic transformation, the configuration characteristics of systems are constantly changing, and the probability of vulnerability exposure is increasing. Therefore, the difficulty and cost of attack are increasing, which provides new ideas for reversing the asymmetric situation of defense and attack in cyberspace. Nonetheless, few related works systematically introduce dynamic defense mechanisms for cyber security. The related concepts and development strategies of dynamic defense are rarely analyzed and summarized. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive and concrete survey of recent research efforts on dynamic defense in cyber security. Specifically, we firstly introduce basic concepts and define dynamic defense in cyber security. Next, we review the architectures, enabling techniques and methods for moving target defense and mimic defense. This is followed by taxonomically summarizing the implementation and evaluation of dynamic defense. Finally, we discuss some open challenges and opportunities on dynamic defense in cyber security.}

abstract = {In recent years cybersecurity attacks have caused major disruption and information loss for online organisations, with high profile incidents in the news. One of the key challenges in advancing the state of the art in intrusion detection is the lack of representative datasets. These datasets typically contain millions of time-ordered events (e.g. network packet traces, flow summaries, log entries); subsequently analysed to identify abnormal behavior and specific attacks (Duffield et al., April). Generating realistic datasets has historically required expensive networked assets, specialised traffic generators, and considerable design preparation. Even with advances in virtualisation it remains challenging to create and maintain a representative environment. Major improvements are needed in the design, quality and availability of datasets, to assist researchers in developing advanced detection techniques. With the emergence of new technology paradigms, such as intelligent transport and autonomous vehicles, it is also likely that new classes of threat will emerge (Kenyon, 2018). Given the rate of change in threat behavior (Ugarte-Pedrero et al., 2019) datasets become quickly obsolete, and some of the most widely cited datasets date back over two decades. Older datasets have limited value: often heavily filtered and anonymised, with unrealistic event distributions, and opaque design methodology. The relative scarcity of (Intrusion Detection System) IDS datasets is compounded by the lack of a central registry, and inconsistent information on provenance. Researchers may also find it hard to locate datasets or understand their relative merits. In addition, many datasets rely on simulation, originating from academic or government institutions. The publication process itself often creates conflicts, with the need to de-identify sensitive information in order to meet regulations such as General Data Protection Act (GDPR) (Regulation, 2016). Another final issue for researchers is the lack of standardised metrics with which to compare dataset quality. In this paper we attempt to classify the most widely used public intrusion datasets, providing references to archives and associated literature. We illustrate their relative utility and scope, highlighting the threat composition, formats, special features, and associated limitations. We identify best practice in dataset design, and describe potential pitfalls of designing anomaly detection techniques based on data that may be either inappropriate, or compromised due to unrealistic threat coverage. Such contributions as made in this paper is expected to facilitate continuous research and development for effectively combating the constantly evolving cyber threat landscape.

We conduct a security analysis of the two approaches, utilizing attacks against a real-world website. Through two experiments—a user study with 65 security analysts and an experimental analysis of attack discovery using DBSCAN clustering—we compare the strategies and features employed by human analysts and clustering system for detecting attacks. Building on these observations, we propose threat models for the human analysis process and for the unsupervised techniques when operating in adversarial settings.

Botnets often use Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs), primarily to evade take-down attempts. DGAs can enlarge the lifespan of a malware campaign, thus potentially enhancing its profitability. They can also contribute to hindering attack accountability. In this work, we introduce HYDRAS, the most comprehensive and representative dataset of Algorithmically-Generated Domains (AGD) available to date. The dataset contains more than 100 DGA families, including both real-world and adversarially designed ones. We analyse the dataset and discuss the possibility of differentiating between benign requests (to real domains) and malicious ones (to AGDs) in real-time. The simultaneous study of so many families and variants introduces several challenges; nonetheless, it alleviates biases found in previous literature employing small datasets which are frequently overfitted, exploiting characteristic features of particular families that do not generalise well.

Ensemble ML models are meta-algorithms that create a pool of several ML approaches and combine them smartly into one predictive model to reduce variance and bias. A number of algorithms, including adaptive boosting, categorical boosting, extreme-boosting, light boosting, random forest, and extra trees, were tested to find their false positive and detection rates. A data pre-processing method was employed to improve detection performance. The statistical approach of minority over-sampling was also employed to tackle over-fitting. An extensive analysis based on a practical dataset of 5000 customers reveals that bagging models outperform other algorithms.

Most recent work on anomaly detection have focused on an accurate modeling of the normal data based on unsupervised methods. To get a satisfactory anomaly detection accuracy, they need pure normal data without abnormal data. This scenario requires many labels to get pure normal data. In many real-world scenarios, there exist abundant unlabeled data and a limited number of partially labeled anomalies. This paper proposes a novel anomaly detection method, PUMAD, which uses a Positive and Unlabeled (PU) learning approach to learn from abundant unlabeled data and a small number of partially labeled anomalies (i.e., positives). PUMAD successfully works on the anomaly detection scenario by exploiting deep metric learning with a hashing-based filtering method. Extensive experimental results on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach based on PU learning is effective to detect anomalies. PUMAD achieves a much higher accuracy of up to 24% than state-of-the-art competitors.}

In this paper, we conduct an in-depth investigation on how deep learning can cope with privacy preservation issues in 5G heterogeneous networks, in terms of heterogeneous radio access networks (RANs), beyond-RAN networks, and end-to-end network slices, followed by a set of key research challenges and open issues that aim to guide future research.}

There are no well-established development guidelines, but the literature contains reports on how companies develop and maintain deployed ML-based software systems. Objective: This study aims to survey the literature related to development and maintenance of large scale ML-based systems in industrial settings in order to provide a synthesis of the challenges that practitioners face. In addition, we identify solutions used to address some of these challenges. Method: A systematic literature review was conducted and we identified 72 papers related to development and maintenance of large scale ML-based software systems in industrial settings. The selected articles were qualitatively analyzed by extracting challenges and solutions. The challenges and solutions were thematically synthesized into four quality attributes: adaptability, scalability, safety and privacy. The analysis was done in relation to ML workflow, i.e. data acquisition, training, evaluation, and deployment. Results: We identified a total of 23 challenges and 8 solutions related to development and maintenance of large scale ML-based software systems in industrial settings including six different domains. Challenges were most often reported in relation to adaptability and scalability. Safety and privacy challenges had the least reported solutions. Conclusion: The development and maintenance on large-scale ML-based systems in industrial settings introduce new challenges specific for ML, and for the known challenges characteristic for these types of systems, require new methods in overcoming the challenges. The identified challenges highlight important concerns in ML system development practice and the lack of solutions point to directions for future research.}

To address this challenge, realistic protection and investigation countermeasures, such as network intrusion detection and network forensic systems, need to be effectively developed. For this purpose, a well-structured and representative dataset is paramount for training and validating the credibility of the systems. Although there are several network datasets, in most cases, not much information is given about the Botnet scenarios that were used. This paper proposes a new dataset, so-called Bot-IoT, which incorporates legitimate and simulated IoT network traffic, along with various types of attacks. We also present a realistic testbed environment for addressing the existing dataset drawbacks of capturing complete network information, accurate labeling, as well as recent and complex attack diversity. Finally, we evaluate the reliability of the BoT-IoT dataset using different statistical and machine learning methods for forensics purposes compared with the benchmark datasets. This work provides the baseline for allowing botnet identification across IoT-specific networks. The Bot-IoT dataset can be accessed at Bot-iot (2018) [1].}

While the problem of insider threat detection has been studied for a long time in both security and data mining communities, the traditional machine learning based detection approaches, which heavily rely on feature engineering, are hard to accurately capture the behavior difference between insiders and normal users due to various challenges related to the characteristics of underlying data, such as high-dimensionality, complexity, heterogeneity, sparsity, lack of labeled insider threats, and the subtle and adaptive nature of insider threats. Advanced deep learning techniques provide a new paradigm to learn end-to-end models from complex data. In this brief survey, we first introduce commonly-used datasets for insider threat detection and review the recent literature about deep learning for such research. The existing studies show that compared with traditional machine learning algorithms, deep learning models can improve the performance of insider threat detection. However, applying deep learning to further advance the insider threat detection task still faces several limitations, such as lack of labeled data, adaptive attacks. We discuss such challenges and suggest future research directions that have the potential to address challenges and further boost the performance of deep learning for insider threat detection.}

Malware detection is one such domain. However, most of the work, mainly focuses on In-VM security techniques which can be evaded easily by malicious users. In this paper, we have proposed a dynamic analysis based introspection approach, called KVMInspector to detect malware in KVM-based cloud environment. The KVMInspector is deployed both inside and outside the VM at the KVM-layer and hence is more robust to attacks. LibVMI and Nitro libraries are used to extract the low-level details of a running virtual machine by viewing its memory, trapping hardware events, and accessing the vCPU registers from KVM. The KVMInspector first performs the process verification at KVM layer to provide a basic security check. After then, a detailed behaviour analysis is carried out to learn the dynamic (run-time) behaviour of the monitored programs using machine learning techniques as an advanced security check. A preliminary analysis has been performed using University of New Maxico (UNM) & University of California dataset and results seem to be promising.}

Unfortunately, IoT devices tend to have many vulnerabilities which can be exploited by an attacker. Unsupervised techniques, such as anomaly detection, can be used to secure these devices in a plug-and-protect manner. However, anomaly detection models must be trained for a long time in order to capture all benign behaviors. Furthermore, the anomaly detection model is vulnerable to adversarial attacks since, during the training phase, all observations are assumed to be benign. In this paper, we propose (1) a novel approach for anomaly detection and (2) a lightweight framework that utilizes the blockchain to ensemble an anomaly detection model in a distributed environment. Blockchain framework incrementally updates a trusted anomaly detection model via self-attestation and consensus among the IoT devices. We evaluate our method on a distributed IoT simulation platform, which consists of 48 Raspberry Pis. The simulation demonstrates how the approach can enhance the security of each device and the security of the network as a whole.}

This paper proposes a method of automating post-exploitation by combining deep reinforcement learning and the PowerShell Empire, which is famous as a post-exploitation framework. Our reinforcement learning agents select one of the PowerShell Empire modules as an action. The state of the agents is defined by 10 parameters such as type of account that was compromised by the agents. In the learning phase, we compared the learning progress of the 3 reinforcement learning models: A2C, Q-Learning, and SARSA. The result shows that the A2C could gain reward most efficiently. Moreover, the behavior of the trained agents are evaluated in a test domain network. The results show that the trained agent using A2C could obtain the administrative privileges to the domain controller.}

Many studies have focused on the accuracy of malware detection, but they did not sufficiently take into account the privacy protection of cloud tenants. This paper proposes a novel malware detection model, based on semi-supervised transfer learning (SSTL) for the cloud, that consists of detection, prediction, and transfer components. To protect the privacy of tenants in the public cloud, a byte classifier based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) for its detection component is designed to detect malware. However, because it is limited by the scarcity of training samples, the accuracy of the byte classifier is only 94.72% after supervised learning. An asm classifier is proposed for the prediction component, and it achieves 99.69% accuracy. The transfer component invokes the prediction component to classify an unlabeled dataset, and it combines the predicted labels and byte features of the unlabeled dataset into a new training dataset. Through the advantages of semi-supervised learning, the new dataset is transferred to the byte classifier for training again. The test results on the Kaggle malware datasets show that semi-supervised transfer learning improved the accuracy of the detection component from 94.72% to 96.9%. The improved malware detection method can not only do a better job of resolving the privacy concerns of tenants in the public cloud than other similar methods, but it can also detect malware more accurately.}

Developments in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and operations research have increased the prevalence of computer systems in decision making tasks across a myriad of applications. Markov decision processes (MDPs) are utilized in a variety of system controllers, and attacks against them are of particular interest, even though this problem structure is relatively understudied in the adversarial learning literature. Therefore, in this research, we consider the finite-horizon MDP poisoning problem wherein an adversary perturbs a decision maker’s baseline MDP formulation to induce desired behavior while balancing the risk of attack detection. We formally define the associated mathematical programming formulation as a mixed-integer bilevel programming problem. We provide a single-level representation that can be handled by some commercial global solvers, but, since their performance is frequently inadequate, we develop gradient-based, gradient-free, and bifurcation heuristic solution methodologies that include self-tuning extensions. The performance of these algorithms is explored on a wide array of sample problem instances to determine their relative efficacy in terms of solution quality and computational effort for different finite-horizon MDP structures.}

Though, they heavily rely on brute force, which is not always an effective choice. On the other hand, expert penetration testers adopt exploit methods that are more accurate, but often not structured. We propose to solve the above mentioned problems, by designing and implementing an intelligent agent, called Suggester, that recommends actions to penetration testers. First, a black-box testing methodology inspired by a penetration tester’s behavior, is developed. Such methodology consists of sending a sequence of strings to a web application and observing the responses. Then, an agent is trained to produce attack strings using the framework of a Multiobjective Reinforcement Learning environment (MORL), with a parameterized action space. Each complete attack string is identified as a separate objective to reach. Q-Learning is used to train the agent upon separate, unrelated objectives. Then, the learned actions are suggested to a human-in-the-loop, who performs the actions and collects observations. This allows to orchestrate the agent into pursuing the right objective and selecting the next best action to recommend. The final evaluation proves the scalability of the proposed solution, as well as show an increase in accuracy when compared to other automated scanners.}

Suitable datasets should include high volumes of real-life data free from attack instances. On account of this requirement, obtaining quality datasets from collected data requires a process of data sanitization that may be prohibitive if done manually, or uncertain if fully automated. In this work, we propose a sanitization approach for obtaining datasets from HTTP traces suited for training, testing, or validating anomaly-based attack detectors. Our methodology has two sequential phases. In the first phase, we clean known attacks from data using a pattern-based approach that relies on tools that detect URI-based known attacks. In the second phase, we complement the result of the first phase by conducting assisted manual labeling systematically and efficiently, setting the focus of expert examination not on the raw data (which would be millions of URIs), but on the set of words that compose the URIs. This dramatically downsizes the volume of data that requires expert discernment, making manual sanitization of large datasets feasible. We have applied our method to sanitize a trace that includes 45 million requests received by the library web server of the University of Seville. We were able to generate clean datasets in less than 84 h with only 33 h of manual supervision. We have also applied our method to some public benchmark datasets, confirming that attacks unnoticed by signature-based detectors can be discovered in a reduced time span.}

abstract = {Since the beginning of the 21st century, the use of cloud computing has increased rapidly, and it currently plays a significant role among most organizations’ information technology (IT) infrastructure. Virtualization technologies, particularly virtual machines (VMs), are widely used and lie at the core of cloud computing. While different operating systems can run on top of VM instances, in public cloud environments the Linux operating system is used 90% of the time. Because of their prevalence, organizational Linux-based virtual servers have become an attractive target for cyber-attacks, mainly launched by sophisticated malware designed at causing harm, sabotaging operations, obtaining data, or gaining financial profit. This has resulted in the need for an advanced and reliable unknown malware detection mechanism for Linux cloud-based environments. Antivirus software and today’s even more advanced malware detection solutions have limitations in detecting new, unseen, and evasive malware. Moreover, many existing solutions are considered untrusted, as they operate on the inspected machine and can be interfered with, and can even be detected by the malware itself, allowing malware to evade detection and cause damage. In this paper, we propose Deep-Hook, a trusted framework for unknown malware detection in Linux-based cloud environments. Deep-Hook hooks the VM’s volatile memory in a trusted manner and acquires the memory dump to discover malware footprints while the VM operates. The memory dumps are transformed into visual images which are analyzed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based classifier. The proposed framework has some key advantages, such as its agility, its ability to eliminate the need for features defined by a cyber domain expert, and most importantly, its ability to analyze the entire memory dump and thus to better utilize the existing indication it conceals, thus allowing the induction of a more accurate detection model. Deep-Hook was evaluated on widely used Linux virtual servers; four state-of-the-art CNN architectures; eight image resolutions; and a total of 22,400 volatile memory dumps representing the execution of a broad set of benign and malicious Linux applications. Our experimental evaluation results demonstrate Deep-Hook’s ability to effectively, efficiently, and accurately detect and classify unknown malware (even evasive malware like rootkits), with an AUC and accuracy of up to 99.9%.}

The PSO algorithm was employed to select outstanding and effective features in the detection of botnets. The voting system, including a deep neural network algorithm, support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree C4.5, were utilized to identify botnets and classify samples. The decision-making strategy of the voting system was based on maximum votes, and the most important innovation of this research was to combine the PSO feature selection algorithm with a voting system using deep learning to identify botnets. Two datasets, ISOT and Bot-IoT, were employed to further verify the BD-PSO-V system performance. BD-PSO-V simulation improved the accuracy by an average of ∼0.42% and 0.17% in the ISOT dataset and the Bot-IoT dataset, respectively, compared to the other methods investigated. In addition, the effect of six well-known adversarial attacks on both datasets was evaluated. Despite a slight drop in accuracy rate, BD-PSO-V results had a promising performance against a variety of attacks.}

abstract = {The management of modern network environments is becoming more and more complex due to new requirements of devices' heterogeneity regarding the popularization of the Internet of Things (IoT), as well as the dynamic traffic required by next-generation applications and services. To address this problem, Software-defined Networking (SDN) emerges as a management paradigm able to handle these problems through a centralized high-level network approach. However, this centralized characteristic also creates a critical failure spot since the central controller may be targeted by malicious users aiming to impair the network operation. This paper proposes an SDN defense system based on the analysis of single IP flow records, which uses the Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) deep learning method to detect DDoS and intrusion attacks. This direct flow inspection enables faster mitigation responses, minimizing the attack's impact over the SDN. The proposed model is tested against several different machine learning approaches over two public datasets, the CICDDoS 2019 and the CICIDS 2018. Furthermore, a lightweight mitigation approach is presented and evaluated through performance tests regarding each detection method. Finally, a feasibility test is performed regarding the throughput of flows per second that each detection method can analyze. This test is accomplished through the use of real IP Flow data collected at a large-scale network. The results point out promising detection rates and an elevated amount of analyzed flows per second, which makes GRU a feasible approach for the proposed system.}

Unfortunately, most of the modern Intrusion Detection System (IDS) technique does not provide sufficient defense services in the wireless environment while maintaining operational continuity and the stability of the defense objective in the presence of intruders and modern attacks. To resolve this problem, we propose a new feature selection technique by combining Ensemble of Feature Selection (EFS) and Chaotic Adaptive Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (CAGOA) method, called ECAGOA. The proposed method has the capability of preventing stagnation issue and is particularly credited to the following three aspects. Firstly, EFS method is applied for selecting the high ranked subset of attributes. Then, we have employed chaos concept in Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) which generates a uniformly distributed population to enhance the quality of the initial populations and has the capability to manage two different issues such as the ability to search for new space termed as exploration and the ability to use existing space termed as exploitation in the optimization process. In order to avoid local optima and premature convergence, lastly, an adaptive grasshopper optimization algorithm is developed by using organized parameter adaptation method. Furthermore, the adaptive behavior of GOA is applied to decide whether a record signifies an anomaly or not, differing from some approaches acquainted in the literature. Support vector machine (SVM) is used as a fitness function in the proposed method to choose the relevant features that can help classify the attacks accurately. In addition, it is also applied to optimize the penalty factor (C), kernel parameter (σ), and tube size (ϵ) of SVM method. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using three popular datasets: ISCX 2012, NSL-KDD and CIC-IDS2017. The evaluation results show that the proposed method outperformed several feature selection techniques from state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection rate, accuracy, and false alarm rate.}

However, vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicles can be damaging to quality of life and human safety. For this reason, many security researchers have studied attacks and defenses for autonomous vehicles. However, there has not been systematic research on attacks and defenses for autonomous vehicles. In this survey, we analyzed previously conducted attack and defense studies described in 151 papers from 2008 to 2019 for a systematic and comprehensive investigation of autonomous vehicles. We classified autonomous attacks into the three categories of autonomous control system, autonomous driving systems components, and vehicle-to-everything communications. Defense against such attacks was classified into security architecture, intrusion detection, and anomaly detection. Due to the development of big data and communication technologies, techniques for detecting abnormalities using artificial intelligence and machine learning are gradually being developed. Lastly, we provide implications based on our systemic survey that future research on autonomous attacks and defenses is strongly combined with artificial intelligence and major component of smart cities.}

Because GOOSE and MMS messages are not encrypted, an attacker can observe packet header information in protocol messages and inject large numbers of spoofed messages that can flood a substation automation system. Sophisticated machine-learning-based intrusion detection systems are required to detect these types of distributed denial-of-service attacks. However, the performance of machine-learning-based classifiers is hindered by the relative lack of features that express GOOSE and MMS protocol behavior. This paper evaluates a number of features described in the literature that may be used to detect distributed denial-of-service attacks on the GOOSE and MMS protocols. However, these features do not include advanced features that capture the periodic transmission behavior of SCADA protocols. Three SCADA-protocol-specific steps are specified for constructing new GOOSE and MMS advanced features by leveraging domain knowledge and adopting a time-window-based feature construction method. The resulting feature set, which comprises seventeen new GOOSE and MMS advanced features, outperforms the feature sets described in previous research when used with the popular decision tree, neural network and support vector machine classifiers. The evaluations also reveal that the decision tree classifier is superior to the neural network and support vector machine classifiers. A key contribution of this research is the application of SCADA-protocol-based domain knowledge to develop high-performance intrusion detection systems that require reduced training and testing times.}

However, this new reality generates significant cybersecurity risks due to the heterogeneous and insecure nature of SG. In particular, SG relies on legacy communication protocols that have not been implemented having cybersecurity in mind. Moreover, the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) creates severe cybersecurity challenges. The Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems constitute an emerging technology in the cybersecurity area, having the capability to detect, normalise and correlate a vast amount of security events. They can orchestrate the entire security of a smart ecosystem, such as SG. Nevertheless, the current SIEM systems do not take into account the unique SG peculiarities and characteristics like the legacy communication protocols. In this paper, we present the Secure and PrivatE smArt gRid (SPEAR) SIEM, which focuses on SG. The main contribution of our work is the design and implementation of a SIEM system capable of detecting, normalising and correlating cyberattacks and anomalies against a plethora of SG application-layer protocols. It is noteworthy that the detection performance of the SPEAR SIEM is demonstrated with real data originating from four real SG use case (a) hydropower plant, (b) substation, (c) power plant and (d) smart home.}

In addition, we explored the potential difficulties with applying unsupervised machine learning approaches to anomaly detection in a network-defense context to understand how to integrate inherently imperfect anomaly-detection approaches into the workflow of a cyber defense infrastructure. Two general approaches can be used to discover anomalies: (1.) detecting rarity, i.e., finding those activities that are observed the least frequently in a set of observations, and (2.) detecting novelty, i.e., finding activities with the lowest estimated probability of observation based on prior observations of baseline (presumably “normal”) data. This effort will describe the case of detecting rarity. In this paper, we describe the entire pipeline starting from explaining the data used, the data ingest, the quantization of features, application of graph analytics to the data, post-processing to reduce results, and measuring the performance. A network-penetration experiment was setup to conduct the network attacks and generate the data that is the input to this work.

Common security solutions that rely on plain payload content analysis such as deep packet inspection are rendered useless. Thus, machine learning based approaches have become an important direction for encrypted malicious traffic detection. In this paper, we formulate a universal framework of machine learning based encrypted malicious traffic detection techniques and provided a systematic review. Furthermore, current research adopts different datasets to train their models due to the lack of well-recognized datasets and feature sets. As a result, their model performance cannot be compared and analyzed reliably. Therefore, in this paper, we analyse, process and combine datasets from 5 different sources to generate a comprehensive and fair dataset to aid future research in this field. On this basis, we also implement and compare 10 encrypted malicious traffic detection algorithms. We then discuss challenges and propose future directions of research.}

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) software is a recent development designed to improve alert volume and content by correlating data from multiple sensors. However, insufficient SIEM configuration has thus far limited the promise of SIEM software for improving intrusion detection. The focus of our research is the implementation of a hybrid kill-chain framework as a novel configuration of SIEM software. Our research resulted in a new log ontology capable of normalizing security sensor data in accordance with modern threat research. New SIEM correlation rules were developed using the new log ontology, and the effectiveness of the new configuration was tested against a baseline configuration.

Intrusion detection systems, which aim to protect our IT infrastructure are not infallible. Attackers take advantage of detector vulnerabilities and weaknesses to evade detection, hence hindering the effectiveness of the detectors. To do so, attackers generate evasion attacks which can eliminate or minimize the detection while successfully achieving the attacker’s goals. This work proposes an artificial arms race between an automated ‘white-hat’ attacker and various anomaly detectors for the purpose of identifying detector weaknesses. The proposed arms race aims to automate the vulnerability testing of the anomaly detectors so that the security experts can be more proactive in eliminating detector vulnerabilities.}

To maintain the accuracy, collecting comprehensive samples continuously is very important. However, new malicious samples appear one after another, and thereby making it difficult. Hence, actual small training samples do not likely to represent the entire population adequately. Despite this gap between ideal and reality, few studies have addressed this practical problem in macro malware. To enhance small training samples, data augmentation is efficient in the field of image recognition. Data augmentation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is a reasonable approach for oversampling the minority class. A major difficulty of GANs is to generate fake samples that represent the context. This paper attempts to generate fake text vectors with Paragraph Vector to enhance small training samples. Paragraph Vector is a model to convert text into vectors, which represents the context and numerical distance. These features allow to directly vary each element of the vectors. Our method adds random noise to the vectors to generate fake text vectors which represent the context. This paper applies this technique to detect new malicious VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macros to address the practical problem. This generic technique could be used for not only malware detection, but also any imbalanced and contextual data. To simulate small training samples, we reduce the malicious samples, and generate fake samples from the reduced ones. The experimental result shows that the fake samples enhance our model, and improve the detection rate.}

Such enhanced probe, able to interact with an agent counterpart deployed into the SIEM platform, is designed by exploiting some machine learning concepts.

To this end, the main related standardization activities and the aligned international projects and research efforts are deeply examined. From this dissection, the skyrocketing growth of the ZSM paradigm can be observed. Concretely, different standardization bodies have already designed reference architectures to set the foundations of novel automatic network management functions and resource orchestration. Aligned with these advances, diverse ML techniques are being currently exploited to build further ZSM developments in different aspects, including multi-tenancy management, traffic monitoring, and architecture coordination, among others. However, different challenges, such as the complexity, scalability, and security of ML mechanisms, are also identified, and future research guidelines are provided to accomplish a firm development of the ZSM ecosystem.}

This work is intended to nip the spamming hosts in the bud. We collected the logs of SMTP sessions initiated from the hosts in the campus for half a year, and analyzed the activities of the hosts with the rates of successful deliveries and various types of failure messages in the sessions as the features. We use an incremental passive-aggressive learning algorithm to efficiently adapt the classifier to the latest spamming activities for detecting the spamming hosts. The detection accuracy can reach 93.5% after the classifier is adjusted in just few rounds. This design will be useful for the network administrators to reliably detect and crack down the internal spamming hosts.}

Nowadays, attackers need to perform several intrusion steps to reach their final objective. The set of these steps is known as multi-step attack, multi-stage attack or attack scenario. Their multi-step nature hinders intrusion detection, as the correlation of more than one action is needed to understand the attack strategy and identify the threat. Since the beginning of 2000s, the security research community has tried to propose solutions to detect this kind of threat and to predict further steps. This survey aims to gather all the publications proposing multi-step attack detection methods. We focus on methods that go beyond the detection of a symptom and try to reveal the whole structure of the attack and the links between its steps. We follow a systematic approach to bibliographic research in order to identify the relevant literature. Our effort results in a corpus of 181 publications covering 119 methods, which we describe and classify. The analysis of the publications allows us to extract some conclusions about the state of research in multi-step attack detection. As far as we know, this is the first survey fully dedicated to multi-step attack detection methods as mechanisms to reveal attack scenarios composed of digital traces left by attackers.}

It creates novel attack surfaces for high impact cyberattacks affecting the society. Addressing the cybersecurity challenges introduced by modern vehicles requires a proactive and multi-faceted approach combining techniques originating from various domains of ICT. Emerging technologies such as 5G, LiDAR, novel in-vehicle and roadside sensors and smart charging, used in modern cars, introduce new challenges and potential security gaps in the next generation mobility ecosystem. Thus, it is critical that the domain’s cybersecurity must be approached in a structured manner from a multi-domain and multi-technology perspective. The CARAMEL H2020 project aims to address the cybersecurity challenges on the pillars upon which the next generation mobility is constructed (i.e., autonomous mobility, connected mobility, electromobility). To achieve that, advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques will be utilized for the identification of anomalies and the classification of incoming signals indicating a cyber-attack or a cybersecurity risk. Apart from risk detection, methods for the mitigation of the identified risks will also be continuously incorporated to the CARAMEL solution. The final goal of CARAMEL is to create an anti-hacking platform for the European automotive cybersecurity and to demonstrate its value through extensive attack and penetration scenarios. In this paper we will expand on the unique cybersecurity-relevant characteristics of the pillars upon which the CARAMEL solution is built. Next, a number of use cases emerging from such analysis will be extracted in order to form the basis upon which the CARAMEL platform will be evaluated. Finally, we will conclude with an overview of the platform’s architectural composition.}

In this paper we explore and evaluate a new approach to learning with label noise in intrinsically high-dimensional data, based on using neighbor occurrence models for hubness-aware k-nearest neighbor classification. Hubness is an important aspect of the curse of dimensionality that has a negative effect on many types of similarity-based learning methods. As we will show, the emergence of hubs as centers of influence in high-dimensional data affects the learning process in the presence of label noise. We evaluate the potential impact of hub-centered noise by defining a hubness-proportional random label noise model that is shown to induce a significantly higher kNN misclassification rate than the uniform random label noise. Real-world examples are discussed where hubness-correlated noise arises either naturally or as a consequence of an adversarial attack. Our experimental evaluation reveals that hubness-based fuzzy k-nearest neighbor classification and Naive Hubness-Bayesian k-nearest neighbor classification might be suitable for learning under label noise in intrinsically high-dimensional data, as they exhibit robustness to high levels of random label noise and hubness-proportional random label noise. The results demonstrate promising performance across several data domains.}

However, their learning process suffers two major issues: (1) inadequate labels: there are many different kinds of attacks but rare abnormal nodes in mt of these atstacks; and (2) inaccurate labels: considering the heavy network flows and new emerging attacks, providing accurate labels for all nodes is very expensive. The inadequate and inaccurate label problem challenges many existing methods because the majority normal nodes result in a biased classifier while the noisy labels will further degrade the performance of the classifier. To tackle these issues, we propose SemiADC, a Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection framework for dynamic Communication networks. SemiADC first approximately learns the feature distribution of normal nodes with regularization from abnormal ones. It then cleans the datasets and extracts the nodes sasainaccurate labels by the learned feature distribution and structure-based temporal correlations. These self-learning processes run iteratively with mutual promotion, and finally help increase the accuracy of anomaly detection. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our SemiADC, which performs substantially better than the state-of-art anomaly detection approaches without the demand of adequate and accurate supervision.}

FGMC-HADS comprises two novel modules: (1) the FRAR method is applied to combine system calls’ identifiers and elapsed times to construct relevant hidden patterns; and (2) the GMM and Correntropy approaches is an anomaly detection technique, the so-called ’Corr-GMM’, developed to fuse multivariate features and recognize unknown anomalous activities, respectively. The posterior probabilities of the GMM are used as input to the Correntropy model to determine the time-series interdependencies of host activities, and then the Corr-GMM constructs legitimate boundaries as a threshold for discovering abnormal behaviors. The proposed FGMC-HADS is trained and validated using the datasets of NGIDS-DS, KDD-98 and new ToN_IoT of Linux data.

For this reason, until now, several model-based Intrusion Response Systems (IRSs) have been proposed with the purpose of limiting the amount of work of the system administrators. However, since the most advanced IRSs adopt a stateful approach, they are subject to what Richard Bellman defined as the curse of dimensionality. Furthermore, modern computer systems are non-stationary, that is, they are subject to frequent changes in their configuration and in their software base, which in turn could make a model-based approach ineffective due to deviations in system behavior with respect to the model. In this paper we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach based on deep reinforcement learning for the implementation of a hybrid model-free IRS. Experimental results show that the proposed IRS is able to deal with non-stationary systems, while reducing the time needed for the computation of the defense policies by orders of magnitude with respect to model-based approaches, and being still able to provide near-optimal rewards.}

Therefore, most existing schemes produce inaccurate results by generating false alarms. These design parameters are comprehensively discussed in this paper.

Green IoT applications based on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are developed in various domains, such as medical, engineering, industry, and smart cities to grow the production. To increase the performance of sustainable cities, communicating nodes are interconnected autonomously to observe the environment, where they need to be more energy-efficient. Edge computing operates in a distributed manner and improves the response time with the least latency through various edge servers. Although the integration of edge computing and Green IoT significantly improves the network performance in terms of computation and data storage, low powered sensors have constraints in terms of battery power, low transmission range, and security aspects. Therefore, adopting an emerging solution is needed to offer energy services with secure data delivery for sustainable cities. This paper presents an intelligent and secure edge-enabled computing (ISEC) model for sustainable cities using Green IoT, which aims to develop the communication strategy with decreasing the liability in terms of energy management and data security for data transportation. The proposed model generates optimal features using deep learning for data routing, which may help to train the sensors for predicting the finest routes toward edge servers. Moreover, the integration of distributed hashing with chaining strategy eases security solutions with efficient computing system. The experimental results reveal the improved performance of the proposed ISEC model against other solutions for energy consumption by 21 %, network throughput by 15 %, end-to-end delay by 12 %, route interruption by 36 %, and network overhead by 52 %.}

Since reliable labelling in spinal cords is only reasonable for the healthy class in the form of untreated spines, semi-supervised deviation-based anomaly detection algorithms are identified as powerful approaches. The main contribution of this paper is a large evaluation of different autoencoders and variational autoencoders for aggregated lesion quantification and a resulting spinal cord lesion quantification method that generates highly correlating quantifications. The conducted experiments showed that several models were able to generate 3D lesion quantifications of the data. These quantifications correlated with the weakly labelled true data with one model, reaching an average correlation of 0.83. We also introduced an area-based model, which correlated with a mean of 0.84. The possibility of the complementary use of the autoencoder-based method and the area feature were also discussed. Additionally to improving medical diagnostics, we anticipate features built on these quantifications to be useful for further applications like clustering into different lesions.}

Fortunately, cyber defense competitions are well-established and provide a critical window into what makes a cybersecurity team more or less effective. We examined data collected at the national finals and four regional events of the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition and posited that experience, access to simulation-based training, and functional role composition by the teams would predict team performance on four scoring dimensions relevant to the application of information assurance skills and defensive cyber operations: (a) maintaining services, (b) help-desk customer support, (c) handling scenario injects, and (d) mitigating red team attacks. Bayesian analysis highlighted that experience was a strong predictor of service availability, scenario injects, and red team defense. Simulation training was also associated with good performance along these scoring dimensions. High-performing and experienced teams clustered with one another based on the functional role composition of team skills.

These attacks intentionally disrupt the services offered by the systems resulting in heavy cost. A flash crowd or flash event is an unexpected surge in the number of visitors to a particular website resulting in a sudden increase in server load. Flash crowds, which are legitimate flows, are difficult to be discriminated from Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks that are illicit flows. Effective and accurate detection of Distributed Denial of Service attacks still remains a challenge due to the difficulty in its detection and the false alerts generated in the case of flash crowds. There is a trade off between detection rate and false positive rate. This work deals with an efficient and early detection of distributed denial of service attacks and discriminates flash crowd by considering two network traffic parameters such as packet size and destination IP address. Using these traffic features two attributes are computed and its generalized entropies are calculated. The threshold is computed using the mean value of network attributes to detect the attacks. Threshold updater can automatically adjust the threshold values according to the changes in the channel conditions. The data sets used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach are the MIT Lincoln Laboratory DARPA data set and a data set generated in a University network. Experimental results show this research approach achieves higher detection rate and lower false positives in a much reduced processing time as compared to the existing methods.}

That formalism, designated Petri nets with players, strategies, and costs, models the states of the cyberattack and events during the attack as markings and transition firings in the net respectively. The formalism models the attacker and defender as competing players who may observe the marking of a subset of the net and based on the observed marking act by changing the stochastic firing rates of a subset of the transitions in order to achieve their competing goals. Rate changes by the players incur a cost. Using the formalism, nets were constructed to model specific cyberattack patterns (cross-site scripting and spear phishing) documented in the Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification database. The models were validated by a panel of cybersecurity experts in a structured face validation process. Given those validated nets, a reinforcement learning algorithm using an -Greedy policy was implemented and set to the task of learning which actions to take, i.e., which transition rates to change for the different observable markings, so as to accomplish the goals of the attacker or defender. Experiments were conducted with a dynamic (learning) attacker against a static (fixed) defender, a static attacker against a dynamic defender, and a dynamic attacker against a dynamic defender. In all cases, the reinforcement learning algorithm was able to improve its performance, in terms of achieving the player’s objective and reducing the cost of doing so, over time. These results demonstrate the potential of formally modeling cyberattacks and of applying reinforcement learning to improving cybersecurity.}

And despite the rising admiration of machine learning and deep learning methods in the cyber-security domain (e.g., a threat detection system), most of these methods are acknowledged as a black-box model. The explainable AI (XAI) has become progressively vital to understand the employed learning models to improve trust level and empower security experts to interpret the prediction decisions. The authors propose a highly efficient model named XSRU-IoMT, for effective and timely detection of sophisticated attack vectors in IoMT networks. The proposed model is developed using novel bidirectional simple recurrent units (SRU) using the phenomenon of skip connections to eradicate the vanishing gradient problem and achieve a fast training process in recurrent networks. We also explore the concepts of XAI to improve trust level by providing explanations of the predictive decisions and enabling humans and security experts to understand the causal reasoning and underlying data evidence. The evaluation results on the ToN_IoT dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed XSRU-IoMT model as compared to the state-of-the-art compelling detection models, suggesting its usefulness as a viable deployment model in real-IoMT networks.}

abstract = {Knowledge obtained from the properties of a Pareto-optimal set can guide an evolutionary search. Learning models for multiobjective estimation of distributions have led to improved search efficiency, but they incur a high computational cost owing to their use of a repetitive learning or iterative strategy. To overcome this drawback, we propose an algorithm for incremental-learning model-based multiobjective estimation of distributions. A learning mechanism based on an incremental Gaussian mixture model is embedded within the search procedure. In the proposed algorithm, all new solutions generated during the evolution are passed to a data stream, which is fed incrementally into the learning model to adaptively discover the structure of the Pareto-optimal set. The parameters of the model are updated continually as each newly generated datum is collected. Each datum is learned only once for the model, regardless of whether it has been preserved or deleted. Moreover, a sampling strategy based on the learned model is designed to balance the exploration/exploitation dilemma in the evolutionary search. The proposed algorithm is compared with six state-of-the-art algorithms for several benchmarks. The experimental results show that there is a significant improvement over the representative algorithms.}

Botnets have been used as the main vector in carrying many cyber crimes reported in the recent news. While a significant amount of research has been accomplished on botnet analysis and detection, several challenges remain unaddressed, such as the ability to design detectors which can cope with new forms of botnets. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect botnet activity based on traffic behavior analysis by classifying network traffic behavior using machine learning. Traffic behavior analysis methods do not depend on the packets payload, which means that they can work with encrypted network communication protocols. Network traffic information can usually be easily retrieved from various network devices without affecting significantly network performance or service availability. We study the feasibility of detecting botnet activity without having seen a complete network flow by classifying behavior based on time intervals. Using existing datasets, we show experimentally that it is possible to identify the presence of existing and unknown botnets activity with high accuracy even with very small time windows.}

The in-depth interdependence of cyber and physical spaces leads to more complicated external environments for such cyber-physical power systems (CPPSs) and brings great challenges to the resilience of CPPSs. A resilient CPS imposes strict requirements for its ability to cope with high-impact, low-probability cyber-physical disturbances. To better study the vulnerability and resilience of CPPSs, several representative blackouts from the past two decades are reviewed from the cyber-physical perspective. Inspired by general system theory, this study offers a framework with three key features of a CPPS and presents the three-layer interdependences from facilities to functions. The differences between CPPS resilience and conventional power system resilience are also emphasized. Thereafter, the study discusses the influence of cyber-physical disturbances from natural hazards, cyberattacks, and human-in-the-loop on the resilience of CPPSs. Accordingly, a survey of the state-of-the-art resilience-oriented techniques for CPPS in the face of natural hazards is organized based on quantitative metrics as well as planning and operation attributes. Regarding the resilience against cyberattacks, relevant cutting-edge research is reviewed in terms of prevention, detection, and mitigation strategies. Furthermore, from the cyber-physical-social perspective, the exploitation of social behaviors to inform the design of the physical system and the cyber system to ultimately enhance the resilience of CPPSs is also studied. Based on the findings from this research, the remaining challenges and the broad prospects of cyber-physical resilience enhancement techniques are also discussed.}

Owing to the ready evasion of the DNS traffic to bypass the network security mechanism, DNS tunnelling can cause severe damage. Thus, an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of the various detection technologies is of considerable importance when facing this type of threat. However, most of the existing reviews focus on a single aspect of the DNS tunnel detection technologies, such as methods based on machine learning, traffic, and payload analysis. In addition, few studies have conducted comprehensive investigation that includes a sequentially integrated range of literature in this researchfield, or have analysed the latest literature on DNS tunnels. This paper reviews these detection technologies from a novel perspective of rule-based and model-based methods with descriptions and analyses of the DNS-based tools and their corresponding features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively discuss and analyse DNS tunnel detection in a novel and specific classification fashion from various aspects in detail, covering almost all the detection methods developed from 2006 to 2020. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of detection methods and several suggestions for future research directions are presented.}

We propose a network forensics mechanism that is scalable in computation time and space while maintaining high accuracy in the identification of the attack origin. We further develop a data reduction method to filter out attack-irrelevant data and only retain evidence relevant to potential attacks for a post-mortem investigation. Using real-world trace driven experiments, we evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism and show that we can trim down up to 97% of attack-irrelevant network traffic and successfully identify attack origin.}

Additionally, smart environments, such as smart healthcare systems, smart industries and smart cities, benefit from sensors and actuators interconnected through the IoT. However, the increase in IoT devices has brought with it the challenge of promptly detecting and combating the cybersecurity attacks and threats that target them, including malware, privacy breaches and denial of service attacks, among others. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes an intelligent architecture that integrates Complex Event Processing (CEP) technology and the Machine Learning (ML) paradigm in order to detect different types of IoT security attacks in real time. In particular, such an architecture is capable of easily managing event patterns whose conditions depend on values obtained by ML algorithms. Additionally, a model-driven graphical tool for security attack pattern definition and automatic code generation is provided, hiding all the complexity derived from implementation details from domain experts. The proposed architecture has been applied in the case of a healthcare IoT network to validate its ability to detect attacks made by malicious devices. The results obtained demonstrate that this architecture satisfactorily fulfils its objectives.}

Unfortunately, today’s security solutions that are used for enterprise information technology (IT) infrastructures are not sufficient to protect CPS, which have largely different properties, involve heterogeneous technologies, and have an architecture that is tailored to specific physical processes. The objective of the synERGY project was to develop new methods, tools and processes for cross-layer anomaly detection (AD) to enable the early discovery of both cyber- and physical-attacks with impact on CPS. To this end, synERGY developed novel machine learning approaches to understand a system’s normal behaviour and detect consequences of security issues as deviations from the norm. The solution proposed by synERGY are flexibly adaptable to specific CPS layers, thus improving the detection capabilities. Moreover, synERGY interfaces with various organizational data sources, such as asset databases, configuration management, and risk data to facilitate the semi-automatic interpretation of detected anomalies. The synERGY approach was evaluated in a utility provider’s environment. This paper reports on the general architecture and the specific pitfalls that needed to be solved, during the design, implementation and deployment of the synERGY system. We foresee this work to be of benefit for researchers and practitioners, who design and implement security systems that correlate massive data from computer logs, the network or organizational context sources, to timely detect cyber attacks.}

Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) is considered a significant threat pertaining to all contemporary and emerging online-based services. Intelligent solutions centered on the utilization of data mining methods are looming on the horizon as possible solutions to counter this kind of attacks. Rule Induction (RI), which is a well-known data mining method is regarded as a possible approach for developing an intelligent DDoS detection system. The current article offers an “Improved RI algorithm” (IRI) which decreases the searching space for generating classification rules by removing all unimportant candidate rule-items along the way of creating the classification model. The main advantage of IRI is producing a group of rules that can be described as concise, easy to understand, and easy-to-implement. In addition, the classifiers generated by IRI are more compact in size which is heavily weighted when producing any classification system. The proposed algorithm is then applied for detecting DDoS attacks (IRIDOS). Empirical evaluations using the UNSW-NB15 dataset that has been obtained from the University of New South Wales confirmed the robustness of IRIDOS.}

It brings numerous benefits such as improved network manageability, flexibility, and programmability to measure up to the enormous demands of future networking. However, it also comes with security concerns that are intrinsically present in SDN’s architecture. In classic SDN, a switch acts as a forwarding device that has to forward a packet towards the centralized controller for every new flow that comes into the network. Out of this design philosophy, a new-flow based distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is born, which presents this internal flow-based policy as a critical security vulnerability to confiscate the scarce resources of the control plane and data plane in an SDN network. In this paper, we propose a classification of such security vulnerabilities exposed by SDN architecture and leveraged by a new-flow based DDoS attack. We also provide an analysis of the latest developments made in recent years on DDoS detection and mitigation research works to overcome these security vulnerabilities. Finally, we discuss SDN security-related research challenges that can be valuable for the research community and academics for carrying out further research and investigation.}

We propose herein Greenshield’s traffic model–based fog computing scheme called Fog–based Rogue Node Detection (F–RouND), which dynamically utilizes the On–Board Units (OBUs) of all vehicles in the region for rogue node detection. We aim to reduce the data processing delays and FPR in detecting rogue nodes at high vehicle densities. The performance of the F–RouND framework was evaluated via simulations. Results show that the F–RouND framework ensures 45% lower processing delays, 12% lower overhead, and 36% lower FPR at the urban scenario compared to the existing rogue node detection schemes even when the number of rogue nodes increases by up to 40% in the region.}

Basic cyber-physical attack models based on probabilistic colored Petri nets are presented. Furthermore, a systematic modeling approach is presented for constructing a quantitative cyber-physical attack model for a cyber-physical system. The weights of the cyber-physical attack model connections are computed using a mixed-strategy attack-defense game model for each node and solving the Nash equilibrium.

Meanwhile, the existing chunk ensembles for classifying imbalanced nonstationary data streams always need to store previous data, which consumes plenty of memory usage. To overcome these issues, we propose a chunk-based incremental ensemble algorithm called Dynamic Updated Ensemble (DUE) for learning imbalanced data streams with concept drift. Compared to the existing techniques, its merits are five-fold: (1) it learns one chunk at a time without requiring access to previous data; (2) it emphasizes misclassified examples in the model update procedure; (3) it can timely react to multiple kinds of concept drifts; (4) it can adapt to the new condition when switching majority class to minority class; (5) it keeps a limited number of classifiers to ensure high efficiency. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DUE in learning nonstationary imbalanced data streams.}

abstract = {Knowledge transfer across several streaming processes remain challenging problem not only because of different distributions of each stream but also because of rapidly changing and never-ending environments of data streams. Albeit growing research achievements in this area, most of existing works are developed for a single source domain which limits its resilience to exploit multi-source domains being beneficial to recover from concept drifts quickly and to avoid the negative transfer problem. An online domain adaptation technique under multi-source streaming processes, namely automatic online multi-source domain adaptation (AOMSDA), is proposed in this paper. The online domain adaptation strategy of AOMSDA is formulated under a coupled generative and discriminative approach of denoising autoencoder (DAE) where the central moment discrepancy (CMD)-based regularizer is integrated to handle the existence of multi-source domains thereby taking advantage of complementary information sources. The asynchronous concept drifts taking place at different time periods are addressed by a self-organizing structure and a node re-weighting strategy. Our numerical study demonstrates that AOMSDA is capable of outperforming its counterparts in 5 of 8 study cases while the ablation study depicts the advantage of each learning component. In addition, AOMSDA is general for any number of source streams. The source code of AOMSDA is shared publicly in https://github.com/Renchunzi-Xie/AOMSDA.git.}

ShellBreaker performs detection by correlating syntactical and semantic features that systematically characterize web shells through three aspects including (i) their communication with external users/attackers, (ii) their adaption to the run-time environment, and (iii) their usage of sensitive operations. We have evaluated ShellBreaker using real-world, PHP-based web shells and benign PHP scripts. Experimental results have demonstrated that ShellBreaker can achieve a high detection rate of 91.7% at a low false positive rate of 1%.}

For transferability of the first task between two datasets, the traffic-features-based method performs significantly better (75% overall accuracy) compared to IP2Vec (22.5% overall accuracy).

One challenge that arises is the large amount of logs generated on an operating system and the need to clarify which information contributes to the detection of possible malware. This work aims at the detection of malware using neural networks based on Windows audit log events. Neural networks can only process continuous data, but Windows audit logs are sequential and textual data. To address these challenges, we extract features out of the audit log events and use LSTMs to capture sequential effects. We create different subsets of features and analyze the effects of additional information. Features describe for example the action-type of windows audit log events, process names or target files that are accessed. Textual features are represented either as one-hot encoding or embedding representation, for which we compare three different approaches for representation learning. Effects of different feature subsets and representations are evaluated on a publicly available data set. Results indicate that using additional information improves the performance of the LSTM-model. While different representations lead to similar classification results, analysis of the latent space shows differences more precisely where FastText seems to be the most promising representation.}

abstract = {The great evolution of communication technologies and potential availability of network access mediums and service providers have led to the appearance of heterogeneous network concept. This paradigm refers to the seamless and ubiquitous interoperability between multi-coverage protocols with different access techniques. A heterogeneous vehicular network (HetVNet) is a heterogeneous network where a vehicle is a smart node equipped with various communication technologies such as Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) and cellular network (3G/4G). The purpose of HetVNet is ensuring a wide area coverage to all vehicles in a large scale network, thus achieving the Always Best Connected (ABC) paradigm where the best continuous connectivity is offered to clients. In addition, HetVNet enables the acquisition and processing of a large amount of data from wide geographical areas via smart vehicles to offer various categories of services to drivers and passengers. There are many challenges in HetVNet and security is one of them since, on one hand, vehicles exchange vital data (about congestions, accidents, hazards, road-works, etc.) and on the other hand they form a specific network with particular characteristics (frequent fragmentation, dynamic topology, no centralized authority, etc.). Intrusion detection systems (IDS) act as a second wall of defense when cryptography is broken and already proved their effectiveness against both external and internal intruders. Therefore, in this research work we propose and implement an intrusion detection and prediction scheme able to detect and especially predict the future misbehavior of a malicious vehicle. The attack prediction technique proposed in this paper is based on a game theory to prevent the occurrence of malicious vehicles. Moreover, the proposed detection scheme detects the most dangerous attacks that target a HetVNet such as false alerts and Sybil attacks. This detection uses a rules-based technique to model a normal behavior of a vehicle. Simulations performed using NS-3 show that our scheme exhibits a high accuracy prediction, faster attack detection, and a low communication overhead compared to current detection frameworks.}

This paper presents a review of the vulnerabilities on wireless technologies that gives connectivity to IoT, and the experiences using Software Defined Radio SDR for implementing wireless attacks to IoT technologies are assessed. A systematic literature review was conducted. The types of vulnerabilities and attacks that can affect the wireless technologies that stand the IoT ecosystem and SDR platforms were compared, and recent methods to overcome these attacks were identified. On the IoT reference model, the perception layer was identified as the most vulnerable. Most attacks at this level occur due to hardware limitations, physical device exposure, and heterogeneity of technologies. Future cybersecurity systems based on SDR technologies have notable advantages due to their flexibility and adaptability to new communication technologies and their potential to develop advanced tools. However, the IoT’s cybersecurity challenges are so complex that merging SDR hardware with cognitive and intelligent techniques is highly advisable. Some of these techniques could include deep learning to adapt mitigation systems to rapid technological changes.}

Intuitively, large damage would be caused in IoT networks if attackers conduct a set of attacks collaboratively and simultaneously. In this work, we investigate this issue and first formalize a multiple-mix-attack model. Then, we propose an approach called Perceptron Detection (PD), which uses both perceptron and K-means method to compute IoT nodes’ trust values and detect malicious nodes accordingly. To further improve the detection accuracy, we optimize the route of network and design an enhanced perceptron learning process, named Perceptron Detection with enhancement (PDE). The experimental results demonstrate that PD and PDE can detect malicious nodes with a higher accuracy rate as compared with similar methods, i.e., improving the detection accuracy of malicious nodes by around 20% to 30%.}

Most of these detection schemes build model of run-time behavior of a process on the basis of its data flow and/or sequence of system calls. These novel techniques have shown promising results but an efficient and effective technique must meet the following performance metrics: (1) high detection accuracy, (2) low false alarm rate, (3) small detection time, and (4) the technique should be resilient to run-time evasion attempts. To meet these challenges, a novel concept of genetic footprint is proposed, by mining the information in the kernel process control blocks (PCB) of a process, that can be used to detect malicious processes at run time. The genetic footprint consists of selected parameters – maintained inside the PCB of a kernel for each running process – that define the semantics and behavior of an executing process. A systematic forensic study of the execution traces of benign and malware processes is performed to identify discriminatory parameters of a PCB (task_struct is PCB in case of Linux OS). As a result, 16 out of 118 task structure parameters are short listed using the time series analysis. A statistical analysis is done to corroborate the features of the genetic footprint and to select suitable machine learning classifiers to detect malware. The scheme has been evaluated on a dataset that consists of 105 benign processes and 114 recently collected malware processes for Linux. The results of experiments show that the presented scheme achieves a detection accuracy of 96% with 0% false alarm rate in less than 100ms of the start of a malicious activity. Last but not least, the presented technique utilizes partial knowledge that is available at a given time while the process is still executing; as a result, the kernel of OS can devise mitigation strategies. It is also shown that the presented technique is robust to well known run-time evasion attempts.}

While several alternatives to mitigate the threat have been proposed, approaches to realtime detection of drive-by download attacks has been predominantly limited to static and semi-dynamic analysis techniques. These techniques examine the original or deobfuscated JavaScript source code to assess the potential maliciousness of a webpage. However, static and semi-dynamic analysis techniques are vulnerable to commonly employed evasion techniques. Dynamic anomaly detection approaches are less susceptible to targeted evasion, but are used less often as a realtime solution on the individual systems because these techniques are typically resource intensive. This paper presents a novel approach to detect drive-by downloads in web browser environments using low resource dynamic analysis. By dynamically monitoring the bytecode stream generated by a web browser during rendering, the approach is able to detect previously unseen drive-by download attacks at runtime. The proposed method is effective, space efficient, and performs the analysis with low performance overhead, making the approach amenable to in-browser drive-by download detection on resource constrained devices, such as mobile phones.}

We develop a coupled control design approach, which incorporates interaction between the intrusion detection system (IDS) and the attacker, with the controller design in the physical layer. In the considered cyber-attack scenario, the attacker attempts to first bypass the IDS to spoof the system actuator and then deteriorate the controller performance in the physical layer. The optimal attack strategy to deceive the IDS is obtained based on a zero-sum game in the detection layer. In the physical layer, it is assumed that the system has a secure compensator along with the actuator to deal with the injected attack values. Therefore, the controller and the compensator are designed based on the results of the game in the detection layer, and stochastic stability analysis and Lyapunov function methods are used to prove boundedness of the system state in the probabilistic sense. Finally, through numerical analysis of a representative example, the proposed design procedure is illustrated and its efficacy in maintaining robust stability of the cyber-physical system under actuator attacks is demonstrated.}

Initially, EliMet passively observes system operators' online reactive behavior against security incidents, and accordingly refines the calculated security measure values. To make the values comply with the expert knowledge, EliMet actively queries operators regarding those states for which sufficient information was not gained during the passive observation. Finally, EliMet makes use of the estimated security measure values for predictive situational awareness by ranking potential cyber-physical contingencies that the security administrators should plan for upfront.

abstract = {Despite Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) significantly developing over the past decade, these networks, like most wireless networks, remain susceptible to malicious interference and spectrum coexistence. Other vulnerabilities arise as WSN applications adopt open standards and typically resource and energy-constrained commercial-off-the-shelf equipment. Deployments include safety-critical applications such as the internet of things, medical, aerospace and space and deep-sea exploration. To manage safety and privacy requirements across such a diverse wireless landscape, security on wireless edge devices needs improvement while maintaining low complexity. This paper improves wireless edge device security by developing a novel intelligent interference diagnostic framework. Received in-phase (I) and quadrature-phase (Q) samples are exclusively utilized to detect modern, subtle and traditional crude jamming attacks. This I/Q sample utilization inherently enables decentralized decision-making, where the low-order features were extracted in a previous study focused on classifying typical 2.4–2.5 GHz wireless signals. The associated optimal intelligent models are leveraged as the foundation for this paper’s work. Initially, Matlab Monte Carlo simulations investigate the ideal case, which incorporates no hardware limitations, identifies the required data type of signal interactions and motivates a hardware investigation. Software-defined radios (SDRs) collect the required live over-the-air I/Q data and transmit matched signal (ZigBee) and continuous-wave interference in developed ZigBee wireless testbeds. Low complexity supervised machine learning models are developed based exclusively on the low-order features and achieve an average accuracy among the developed models above 98%. The designed methodology involves examining ZigBee over-the-air data for artificial jamming and SDR jamming of ZigBee signals transmitted from SDR and commercial (XBee) sources. This approach expands to a legitimate node classification technique and an overall algorithm for wireless edge device interference diagnostic tools. The investigation includes developing Support Vector Machine, XGBoost and Deep Neural Network (DNN) models, where XGBoost is optimal. Adapting the optimized models to global positioning system signals establishes the transferability of the designed methodology. Implementing the designed approaches on a Raspberry Pi embedded device examines a relatively resource-constrained deployment. The primary contribution is the real experimentally validated interference diagnostic framework that enables independent device operation, as no channel assumptions, network-level information or spectral images are required. Developed models exclusively use I/Q data low-order features and achieve high accuracy and generalization to unseen data.}

With advances in artificial intelligence and increasing importance for anomaly detection and prevention in various domains, artificial neural network approaches enable the detection of more complex anomaly types while considering temporal and contextual characteristics. In this article, a survey on state-of-the-art anomaly detection using deep neural and especially long short-term memory networks is conducted. The investigated approaches are evaluated based on the application scenario, data and anomaly types as well as further metrics. To highlight the potential of upcoming anomaly detection techniques, graph-based and transfer learning approaches are also included in the survey, enabling the analysis of heterogeneous data as well as compensating for its shortage and improving the handling of dynamic processes.}

abstract = {A cyber attack launched on a critical infrastructure (CI), such as a power grid or a water treatment plant, could lead to anomalous behavior. There exist several methods to detect such behavior. This paper reports on a study conducted to compare two methods for detecting anomalies in CI. One of these methods, referred to as design-centric, generates invariants from the design of a CI. Another method, referred to as data-centric, generates the invariants from data collected from an operational CI. The key question that motivated the study is “How do design and data-centric methods compare in the effectiveness of the generated invariants in detecting process anomalies.” The data-centric approach used Association Rule Mining for generating invariants from operational data. These invariants, and their performance in detecting anomalies, was compared against those generated by a design-centric approach reported in the literature. The entire study was conducted in the context of an operational scaled down version of a water treatment plant.}

Thorough the performed research two novel threats were defined: workload-based EDoS (W-EDoS) and Instantiation-based EDoS (I-EDoS). W-EDoS is characterized by executing expensive requests in terms of computational resources at the victim system, hence exhausting its workload and forcing operators to contract additional resources. On the other hand, I-EDoS occurs when the cloud management software deploys more instances of virtual network functions than needed as a response to requests that resemble legitimate, but are malicious, thus increasing the cost of the hired resources. In order to contribute to their mitigation, a security architecture that incorporates network-based intrusion detection capabilities for their recognition is proposed. It implements strategies that lie on predicting the behavior of the protected system, constructing adaptive thresholds, and clustering of instances based on productivity. An extensive experimentation has been conducted to demonstrate the proposal effectiveness, which includes case studies and the accuracy assessment when considering different adjustment parameters. Under the most intense conditions, the highest AUC performed above 98% when assessing the I-EDoS detection accuracy, being the same reading higher than 99% in the case of W-EDoS.}

On the other hand, progress towards self-organizing networks, and the different techniques involved in their development, such as software-defined networking, network-function virtualization, artificial intelligence or cloud computing, facilitates the design of new defensive strategies, more complete, consistent and able to adapt the defensive deployment to the current status of the network. In order to contribute to their development, in this paper, the use of artificial immune systems to mitigate denial of service attacks is proposed. The approach is based on building networks of distributed sensors suited to the requirements of the monitored environment. These components are capable of identifying threats and reacting according to the behavior of the biological defense mechanisms in human beings. It is accomplished by emulating the different immune reactions, the establishment of quarantine areas and the construction of immune memory. For their assessment, experiments with public domain datasets (KDD’99, CAIDA’07 and CAIDA’08) and simulations on various network configurations based on traffic samples gathered by the University Complutense of Madrid and flooding attacks generated by the tool DDoSIM were performed.}

Deep learning models based on autoencoder (AE) have been applied to address the above difficulties successfully. However, in these AE-based deep methods, the AE-based model’s optimization and the anomaly detector design are separated. Therefore, the latent representations in AE are less relevant for the anomaly detection task, which reduces the accuracy of anomaly detection. A deep support vector data description based on variational autoencoder (Deep SVDD-VAE) is proposed in this paper to solve this problem. In the proposed model, VAE is used to reconstruct the input instances, while a spherical discriminative boundary is learned with the latent representations simultaneously based on SVDD. Unlike existing AE-based methods, we seek the model parameters via the joint optimization of VAE and SVDD, which ensures the separability of the latent representations. Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and GTSRB datasets show the effectiveness of Deep SVDD-VAE.}

abstract = {One-class classification is a machine learning problem, where training data has only one class. The objective is to determine if the input data is seen class or unseen class. Traditional deep learning algorithms are not suitable for this task since the algorithm can predict only class in training data. In this paper, the one-class classification algorithm using construction error of image transformation network (OCITN) is proposed. In particular, image transformation network (ITN) is introduced as a subtask, which transforms input image into one image, namely goal image. Moreover, the error of ITN, namely construction error (CE), is computed as a distance metric between the goal image and model output. ITN model is trained using only one-class images and is applied for testing images. Since the model is trained with only one-class images, the CE for one-class is small relative to other classes. Thus, one-class classification is made determining CE is large or small. The proposed method is experimented with using MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Cat-vs-Dog datasets. OCITN shows good results where the goal image has high entropy. Additionally, the extension of OCITN, namely OCITNE, is implemented. This method shows the state of the art performance in MNIST (98.0), Fashion MNIST(95.6), and acceptable performance in CIFAR10(78.4). Furthermore, these methods provide high-speed processing, OCITN process 5291 images, and OCITNE 1261 images per second, 137 times and 33 times faster than state of the art.

While the introspections are useful for narrowing down the semantic gap between the status observed at the hypervisor-level and that seen in a VM, they potentially reveal the sensitive information of a tenant stored in the machine. In this paper, we aim to infer specific program activities in a VM without VMI methods, where our approach has to solve the strong semantic gap problem. We introduce Infermatic, a system that utilizes only hypervisor-level features and supervised machine learning methods to infer program behaviors in a VM. Using the classifiers trained by Infermatic, we can also bridge the strong semantic gap by systematically identifying the semantic links between our hypervisor features and selected program behaviors. In evaluations, we demonstrate that the hypervisor features are effective in isolating program activities and do so with an average accuracy of 0.875 (AUC) for the 24 behaviors that we have identified. In addition, our statistical models (or trained classifiers) can identify the hypervisor features that accurately characterize selected program behaviors when they involve lower-level operations. We further extend Infermatic’s ability to detect program behaviors to other security applications—we present a malicious VM detector for the cloud that achieves an average detection of 0.817 (AUC). Our detector shows the hypervisor features are resilient against evasion attacks even when an attacker can reduce the number of available features to the system. Moreover, we present that the detector can operate in a scalable manner by identifying a malicious VM even when the VM under inspection is collocated with other VM’s operating under workloads.}

In this study, we proposed a flexible testbed for the first time, that can evaluate NGFWs in terms of security and multicast networking performances. The most popular brand datacenter type NGFWs were also tested by using the testbed under various attacks and network designs. The results showed that NGFWs can be used as both rendezvous points in Layer 3 and bridge mode in Layer 2 in multicast networks successfully. Moreover, proposed testbed allows testing the security functions of NGFWs and benchmark them in terms of threat prevention performance.}

One such category of attacks is the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), which can have serious consequences including impaired customer experience, service outage and in severe cases, complete shutdown and total economic unsustainability. Advances in Internet of Things (IoT) and network connectivity have inadvertently facilitated launch of DDoS attacks which have increased in volume, frequency and intensity. Recent DDoS attacks involving new attack vectors and strategies, have precipitated the need for this survey. In this survey, we mainly focus on finding the gaps, as well as bridging those gaps between the future potential DDoS attacks and state-of-the-art scientific and commercial DDoS attack defending solutions. It seeks to highlight the need for a comprehensive detection approach by presenting the recent threat landscape and major cloud attack incidents, estimates of future DDoS, illustrative use cases, commercial DDoS solutions, and the laws governing DDoS attacks in different nations. An up-to-date survey of DDoS detection methods, particularly anomaly based detection, available research tools, platforms and datasets, has been given. This paper further explores the use of machine learning methods for detection of DDoS attacks and investigates features, strengths, weaknesses, tools, datasets, and evaluates results of the methods in the context of the cloud. A summary comparison of statistical, machine learning and hybrid methods has been brought forth based on detailed analysis. This paper is intended to serve as a ready reference for the research community to develop effective and innovative detection mechanisms for forthcoming DDoS attacks in the cloud environment. It will also sensitize cloud users and providers to the urgent need to invest in deployment of DDoS detection mechanisms to secure their assets.}

However, few of them have considered the existence of service attackers who can adapt their attacking strategies to the topology-varying environment and service providers’ strategies. In this paper, we investigate the security and dependability mechanism when service providers are facing service attacks of software and hardware, and propose a stochastic evolutionary coalition game (SECG) framework for secure and reliable defenses in virtual sensor services. At each stage of the game, service providers observe the resource availability, the quality of service (QoS), and the attackers’ strategies from cloud monitoring systems (CMSs) and IDSs. According to these observations, they will decide how evolutionary coalitions should be dynamically formed for reliable virtual-sensor-service composites to deliver data and how to adaptively defend in the face of uncertain attack strategies. Using the evolutionary coalition game, virtual-sensor-service nodes can form a reliable service composite by a reliability update function. With the Markov chain constructed, virtual-sensor-service nodes can gradually learn the optimal strategy and evolutionary coalition structure through the minimax-Q learning, which maximizes the expected sum of discounted payoffs defined as QoS for virtual-sensor-service composites. The proposed SECG strategy in the virtual-sensor-service attack-defense game is shown to achieve much better performance than strategies obtained from the evolutionary coalition game or stochastic game, which only maximizes each stage's payoff and optimizes a defense strategy of stochastic evolutionary, since it successfully accommodates the environment dynamics and the strategic behavior of the service attackers.}

In this paper, we propose a supervised energy-based approach for anomaly detection in a clean water supply system using a new dataset which is physically modelled in the Festo MPA workstation rig. The novelty relies on the set of engineered features collected from the testbed, including voltage, current and power from the sensors that compose the ICS. These values are obtained from independent current sensors that we have physically wired to the testbed. Five machine learning algorithms; Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbours, Multilayer Perceptron, Decision Tree and Random Forest are employed to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed features. The metrics used to present the performance of the selected machine learning algorithms are F1-Score, G-Mean, False Positive Rate (FPR) and False Negative Rate (FNR). The results show that machine learning algorithms can classify the variations of energy produced by the execution of cyber-attacks as anomalous by achieving 95.5% F1-Score, and 6.8% FNR with the Multilayer Perceptron classifier.}

The motivation stems from the growth of cyber attacks using techniques that have been employed to surreptitiously deploy Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). APTs are becoming more sophisticated and able to obfuscate much of their identifiable features through encryption, custom code bases and in-memory execution. Our hypothesis is that we can produce a high degree of accuracy in distinguishing malicious from trusted samples using Machine Learning with features derived from the inescapable footprint left behind on a computer system during execution. This includes CPU, RAM, Swap use and network traffic at a count level of bytes and packets. These features are continuous and allow us to be more flexible with the classification of samples than discrete features such as API calls (which can also be obfuscated) that form the main feature of the extant literature. We use these continuous data and develop a novel classification method using Self Organizing Feature Maps to reduce over fitting during training through the ability to create unsupervised clusters of similar “behaviour” that are subsequently used as features for classification, rather than using the raw data. We compare our method to a set of machine classification methods that have been applied in previous research and demonstrate an increase of between 7.24% and 25.68% in classification accuracy using our method and an unseen dataset over the range of other machine classification methods that have been applied in previous research.}

Due to the convenience, users often store a large amount of private information on their phones (e.g., photos) and use the phone to process sensitive operations (e.g., financial transactions). Thus, there is a great need to protect the devices from unauthorized access in order to avoid privacy leakage and financial loss. Passwords are the most widely used authentication method, but attackers can take over the phone after it is unlocked. Instead, behavioral authentication can verify current users in a continuous way, which can complement the existing authentication mechanisms like passwords. With the increasing capability of smartphone sensors, users can perform various touch actions to interact with their devices. Motivated by this, in this work, we focus on swipe behavior and develop SwipeVlock, a supervised unlocking mechanism on smartphones, which can authenticate users based on their way of swiping the phone screen with a background image. In the evaluation, we measure several typical supervised learning algorithms and conduct two user studies with over 150 participants. As compared with similar schemes, it is found that participants could perform well with SwipeVLock, i.e., with a success rate of 98% during login and retention.}

abstract = {In the past decade the security of industrial control systems has emerged as a research priority in order to safeguard our critical infrastructures. A large number of research efforts have focused on intrusion detection in industrial networks, however, few of them discuss what to do after an intrusion has been detected. Because the safety of most of these control systems is time-sensitive, we need new research on automatic incident response. In this article we show how software-defined networks, and network-function virtualization can facilitate automatic incident response to a variety of attacks against industrial networks. We also prototype an incident response solution that detects and responds automatically to sensor attacks and controller attacks. Our work shows the promise that cloud-enabled software-defined networks and virtual infrastructures hold as a way to provide novel defense-in-depth solutions for industrial systems.}

abstract = {The discovery of sophisticated attack sequences demands the development of significantly better alert correlation algorithms. Most of the proposed approaches in the area of multi-step attack detection have limited capabilities because they rely on various forms of predefined knowledge of attacks or attack transition patterns using attack modeling language or pre-and post-conditions of individual attacks. Therefore, those approaches cannot recognize a correlation when an attack is new or the relationship between attacks is new. In this research, we take a different view and consider alert correlation as the problem of inferring an intruder’s actions as alert patterns that are constructed progressively. The work is based on a multi-layer episode mining and filtering algorithm. A decision-tree-based method is used for learning specifications of each attack pattern and detecting them in alert streams. We also used a Correlation Weight Matrix (CWM) for encoding correlation strength between attack types in the attack scenarios. One of the distinguishing features of our proposed technique is detecting novel multi-step attack scenarios, using a rule prediction method. The results have shown that our approach can effectively discover known and unknown attack strategies with high accuracy. We achieved more than 90% reduction in the number of discovered patterns while more than 95% of final patterns were actual patterns. Furthermore, our rule prediction capability showed a precise forecasting ability in guessing future alerts.}

Most of these CIs are cyber–physical systems (CPSs), which integrate the network’s computational and communication capabilities to facilitate the monitoring and controlling of physical processes. Such systems are vulnerable to damage due to natural disasters, physical incidents, or cyber-attacks impacting the CPS organizations managing complex industrial control systems and data acquisition systems. When these CPSs are exposed to systemic cyber risks and cascaded network failures, network administrators need to recover from the compromise under limited resources. This is formulated as an attacker-defender game model to emulate the decision-making process in choosing an appropriate attack/defence mechanism in response to cybersecurity incidents using game theory. To further improve the assumptions made in the pure game-theoretic model, we relax the constraints on the rationality of the players, monetary payoff, and completeness of information by incorporating learning in games using reinforcement learning technique and compute the expected payoff using linguistic fuzzy variables.}

LAMS can reduce a large portion of false positives introduced by the anomaly detection by replacing the anomaly detector's output on a network event with an aggregate of its output on all similar network events observed previously. The arguments are supported by extensive experimental evaluation involving several anomaly detectors in two domains: NetFlow and proxy logs. Finally, we show how the proposed solution can be efficiently implemented to process large streams of non-stationary data.}

In contrast to most previous solutions, the proposal assumes the non-stationarity and heterogeneity inherent in the emergent communication environment. In particular, the approach takes advantage of the monitorization and knowledge acquisition capabilities implemented in the SELFNET (H2020-ICT-2014-2/671672) project, which facilitates its implementation as a self-organizing solution on 5G mobile networks. Monitorization, feature extraction and knowledge acquisition tasks are carried out on centralized control plane, hence the proposed architecture minimizes the impact on operational performance and prompts the end-points mobility. The preliminary results observed when considering different metrics, adjustment parameters, and a dataset with traffic observed in 61 real devices proven efficiency when distinguishing normal activities from DDoS behaviors of different intensity. With an optimal granularity selection, the highest AUC reached values close to 1.0 when measured under the most intense attacks, hence demonstrating optimal TPR and FPR relationships by adapting to the instantiated use cases.}

Specifically, we propose ASiMOV (Asynchronous Modular Verification), a self-protecting architecture for cyber–physical systems realizing a verifiable control application. ASiMOV is inspired by modular redundancy and leverages virtualization technologies to respond and to prevent cyber-attacks to the control logic. Using simulation experiments, we evaluate: the effects of an attack on an industrial control application enhanced by ASiMOV; the delay introduced by ASiMOV within a control loop; and the cyber-attack detection delay. Results show that, in the simulated scenario, the controller can work with a sampling rate of up to 200 Hertz. Any tampering with the control logic is detected without false positives/negatives in a time equal to the latency between the proposed control application and the proposed IDS (e.g., tens to hundreds of milliseconds).}

As a result, unlike conventional vehicles, autonomous vehicles have to communicate with other vehicles as well as other external network infrastructure. However, such requirements make autonomous vulnerable to the attack. This may also motivate diverse types of cyber threats and attacks like traffic signs modification, GPS spoofing, and Vehicular Adhoc network distributed denial of service.

However, static code analysis can be vulnerable to code obfuscation techniques. Behavioural data collected during file execution is more difficult to obfuscate, but takes a relatively long time to capture - typically up to 5 min, meaning the malicious payload has likely already been delivered by the time it is detected. In this paper we investigate the possibility of predicting whether or not an executable is malicious based on a short snapshot of behavioural data. We find that an ensemble of recurrent neural networks are able to predict whether an executable is malicious or benign within the first 5 s of execution with 94% accuracy. This is the first time general types of malicious file have been predicted to be malicious during execution rather than using a complete activity log file post-execution, and enables cyber security endpoint protection to be advanced to use behavioural data for blocking malicious payloads rather than detecting them post-execution and having to repair the damage.}

abstract = {Unsupervised techniques typically rely on the probability density distribution of the data to detect anomalies, where objects with low probability density are considered to be abnormal. However, modeling the density distribution of high dimensional data is known to be hard, making the problem of detecting anomalies from high-dimensional data challenging. The state-of-the-art methods solve this problem by first applying dimension reduction techniques to the data and then detecting anomalies in the low dimensional space. Unfortunately, the low dimensional space does not necessarily preserve the density distribution of the original high dimensional data. This jeopardizes the effectiveness of anomaly detection. In this work, we propose a novel high dimensional anomaly detection method called LAKE. The key idea of LAKE is to unify the representation learning capacity of layer-constrained variational autoencoder with the density estimation power of kernel density estimation (KDE). Then a probability density distribution of the high dimensional data can be learned, which is able to effectively separate the anomalies out. LAKE successfully consolidates the merits of the two worlds, namely layer-constrained variational autoencoder and KDE by using a probability density-aware strategy in the training process of the autoencoder. Extensive experiments on six public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in detecting anomalies and achieves up to 37% improvement in F1 score.}

The system consists of the three subsystems, detection of attack events subsystem; attack events analysis subsystem to model active patterns based on Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) definitions; and the attack pattern visualization subsystem. The results obtained from the attacks carried out over a period of six months under a series of assumptions are shown.

In addition, some network traffic is unbalanced, which leads to low detection accuracy. Therefore, an unbalanced abnormal traffic detection method has been proposed. It is composed of the improved bidirectional residual gated recurrent unit (Res-BIGRU) and integrated dynamic extreme learning machine (IDELM). First, the candidate hidden state activation function of the GRU is changed into an unsaturated activation function. The residual connection is used to avoid the vanishing gradient. The purpose of alleviating network degradation is achieved, and the traffic features extracted are better. Second, an IDELM is proposed to solve the unbalanced classification. The minority samples are generated by the IDELM model. The set model in game theory is used to compute the combined weight, which improves the fitting effect. Third, two IDELMs are used to update the final classification results. Fourth, four network datasets and IoT datasets are used to verify the performance. The average accuracy on four network datasets is 91.11% when samples are unbalanced. Furthermore, it can be concluded that the improved Res-BIGRU and IDELM strategy is effective. Better classification results can be achieved when network traffic is unbalanced. In particular, the performance is better in unbalanced NSL-KDD datasets. The index values obtained are the best compared with other methods. It is also suitable for intrusion detection of the Internet of Things, which has good performance. The further advantage lies in that the robustness is better when there are other sample interferences.}

Numerous approaches have been adopted in the past to detect and prevent DDoS attacks but lack in providing efficient and reliable attack detection. As a result, there is still notable room for improvement in providing security against DDoS attacks. In this paper, a novel high-efficient approach is proposed named DIDDOS to protect against real-world new type DDoS attacks using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Different classification algorithms such as Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Naive Bayes (NB), and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) are utilized to detect and identify DDoS attacks. Performance evaluation metrics like accuracy, recall, f1-score, and precision are used to evaluate the efficiency of the machine and deep learning classifiers. Experimental results yield the highest accuracy of 99.69% for DDoS classification in case of reflection attacks and 99.94% for DDoS classification in case of exploitation attacks using GRU.}

Using sophisticated attack techniques, attackers remotely control infected machines and exfiltrate sensitive information from organizations and governments. Security products deployed by enterprise networks based on traditional defenses often fail at detecting APT infections because of the dynamic nature of the APT attack process. To overcome the current limitations of attack network dynamics faced in APT studies, an innovative APT attack detection model based on a semi-supervised learning approach and complex networks characteristics is proposed in this paper. The entire targeted network is modeled as a small-world network and the evolving APT-Attack Network (APT-AN) as a scale-free network. Finite state machines are employed to model the state transitions of the nodes in the time domain in order to characterize the state changes during the APT attack process. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated by applying it to real-world data from a large-scale enterprise network consisting of 17,684 hosts from the Los Alamos security lab. The proposed approach analyzes efficiently the large-scale dataset to reveal APT attack characteristics between the command and control center and the victim hosts. The final result is a ranked list of suspicious hosts participating in APT attack activities. The average detection precision of three APT stage is 90.5% in our proposed APT detection framework. The results show that the model can effectively detect the suspicious hosts at different stages of the APT attack process.}

Poorly designed IRS and IRA may reduce network performance and wrongly disconnect users from a network.

We introduce a new taxonomy of deep learning architectures for emerging cloud computing architectures and provide deep insights into the current state-of-the-art active research works on deep learning to solve complex problems in emerging cloud computing architectures. The synthesis and analysis of the articles as well as their limitation are presented. A lot of challenges were identified in the literature and new future research directions to solve the identified challenges are presented. We believed that this article can serve as a reference guide to new researchers and an update for expert researchers to explore and develop more deep learning applications in the emerging cloud computing architectures.}

In this context, anomaly detection is a particularly hard problem, given the need to find computing-energy-accuracy trade-offs in a constrained environment. We taxonomize methods ranging from conventional techniques (statistical methods, time-series analysis, signal processing, etc.) to data-driven techniques (supervised learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning, etc.). We also look at the impact that different architectural environments (Cloud, Fog, Edge) can have on the sensors ecosystem.

In this paper, we review representative techniques in honeypots, honeytokens, and moving target defense, spanning from the late 1980s to the year 2021. Techniques from these three domains complement with each other and may be leveraged to build a holistic deception based defense. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been a work that provides a systematic retrospect of these three domains all together and investigates their integrated usage for orchestrated deceptions. Our paper aims to fill this gap. By utilizing a tailored cyber kill chain model which can reflect the current threat landscape and a four-layer deception stack, a two-dimensional taxonomy is developed, based on which the deception techniques are classified. The taxonomy literally answers which phases of a cyber attack campaign the techniques can disrupt and which layers of the deception stack they belong to. Cyber defenders may use the taxonomy as a reference to design an organized and comprehensive deception plan, or to prioritize deception efforts for a budget conscious solution. We also discuss two important points for achieving active and resilient cyber defense, namely deception in depth and deception lifecycle, where several notable proposals are illustrated. Finally, some outlooks on future research directions are presented, including dynamic integration of different deception techniques, quantified deception effects and deception operation cost, hardware-supported deception techniques, as well as techniques developed based on better understanding of the human element.}

abstract = {Today, most organizations employ cloud computing environments for both computational reasons and for storing their critical files and data. Virtual servers are an example of widely used virtual resources provided by cloud computing architecture. Therefore, virtual servers are considered an attractive target for cyber-attackers, who launch their attacks by malware such as the well-known remote access trojans (RATs) and more modern malware such as ransomware and cryptojacking. Existing security solutions implemented on virtual servers fail to detect these newly created malware (zero-day attacks). In fact, by the time the security solution is updated, the organization has likely already been attacked. In this study, we present a designated framework aimed at trusted and secured detection of newly created and unknown instances of malware on virtual machines in an organization's private cloud. We took volatile memory dumps from a virtual machine (VM) in a secured and trusted manner, and analyzed all of the data within the memory dumps using the MinHash method; MinHash is well suited for the accurate detection of malware in VMs based on efficient volatile memory dump comparisons. The proposed framework is evaluated in a comprehensive set of experiments of increasing difficulty in which we also measured the detection performance of different classifiers (both similarity and machine learning-based classifiers, using collections of real-world, professional, notorious malware and legitimate applications. The evaluation results show that our framework can detect the anomalous state of a virtual server, as well as known, new, and unknown malware, with very high TPRs (100% for ransomware and RATs) and very low FPRs (1.8% for ransomware and no FPR for RATs). We also show how the methodology's performance can be improved, in terms of required time and storage space, saving more than 86% of these resources. Finally, we demonstrate the generalization capabilities and practicality of our methodology by using transfer learning and learning from just one virtual server in order to detect unknown malware on a different virtual server.}

abstract = {With the increased reliance on digitization in industrial control systems, the need for effective monitoring techniques has risen dramatically. Specifically, there is now a growing concern about the so-called false data injection (FDI) attacks. These attacks aim to alter the raw sensors’ data to cause malicious outcomes. Any serious FDI algorithm is based on an intimate knowledge of the system and its associated physics models, which renders conventional outlier/anomaly detection techniques almost obsolete in the face of such attacks. Thus, a critical need has emerged to develop a new class of defense methods that are capable of detecting FDI attacks under the assumption that the attacker has a strong familiarity with the system and its physics modeling. This class of defense methods are denoted by model-based defenses which are premised on the assumption that the attacker, while having a good understanding of the system, does not have full privileged access to all proprietary data and historical records of operation. However, (s)he is assumed to be capable of learning system behavior using self-learning techniques during an initial lie-in-wait period. To defend against this scenario, we propose a new model-based randomized window algorithm that searches time-series data for signatures that can serve as classifiers between normal and FDI scenarios. The classifiers are based on the correlations between the dominant degrees of freedom (DOFs) and the less-dominant DOFs (expected to be very sensitive to the system details that are unknown to the attacker). For demonstration, RELAP5 models are employed to calculate representative nuclear reactor behavior during a number of transient scenarios. Falsified data are injected into the RELAP5-simulated behavior, and the proposed signature-identification algorithm is employed to detect the injected data.}

Our system adds additional levels of security without burdening the user with more credentials to manage. We utilize two complementary authentication modalities to validate user-identity: (1) behavior profiling for user-system interaction, and (2) baiting adversaries using automatically distributed file-decoy tripwires. We present the results from a 160-subject user study used to validate our system. Our results show that the presence of decoy documents on a system does not interfere with normal user activities, and that, with 95% accuracy, our system will detect an intrusion within 15 minutes with at most one false-positive for 40 hours of user activity.}

The novel graph-based temporal behavioural model proposed here detects an anomaly at the quickest possible instance of occurrence of the attack. Experimental evaluations of the real world programs like ‘sudo’ and ‘nginx’ show the detection of anomalous deviation at 12.25% and 36.47% of the execution of these programs, respectively.

FODN4PS consists of a Moving Object Region Extraction Network (MORE Net) and a classification network, where the MORE Net can get the position of foreign objects, and the classification network can recognize the category of foreign objects.

In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning-based method for modeling attacker activities based on the following intuitive observations: attackers in the same botnet tend to launch temporally close attacks. We then directly model attack temporal patterns using a special class of point process called Multivariate Hawkes Process. Intuitively, Multivariate Hawkes Process identifies the latent influences between attackers by utilizing the mutually exciting properties. We then cluster the attacker activities based on the inferred weighted influence matrix with resort to the graph-based clustering approach. To evaluate the applicability of our method, we deployed 10 honeypots in a real-world environment, and conduct experiments on the collected dataset. The results show that we can identify the activity pattern and the structure of botnets effectively.}

abstract = {The security of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) has been recently receiving significant attention from the research community. While the majority of such attention originates from the control theory domain, few approaches have addressed the problem from the practical perspective. In this work, we do not claim that we propose a particular solution to a specific problem related to CPS security, but rather present a first look into what can help shape these solutions in the future. Indeed, our vision and ultimate goal is to attempt to merge or at least diminish the gap between highly theoretical solutions and practical approaches derived from insightful empirical experimentation, for securing CPS. Motivated by the scarcity of malicious empirical data that can be captured, inferred and analyzed from within operational CPS settings, this paper adopts a unique approach to derive notions of CPS maliciousness based on passive measurements and analysis. Indeed, by scrutinizing unsolicited real traffic targeting routable, allocated but unused Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (i.e., darknet traffic), we shed the light on attackers’ intentions and actual attacks targeting ample of CPS communication and control protocols. To permit such analysis, we initially devise and evaluate a novel probabilistic model that aims at filtering noise (i.e., misconfiguration traffic) that is embedded in darknet traffic. Subsequently, a near real-time inference algorithm is designed and implemented to detect CPS probing and denial of service activities. To this end, we characterize such misdemeanors in terms of their types, their frequency, their target protocols and possible orchestration behavior. The outcome demonstrate a staggering 16 thousand scanning attempts and close to 8 thousand denial of service attacks on various CPS protocols. Further, the results uncover stealthy probing activities targeting proprietary CPS protocols and clusters of coordinated unsolicited activities. We concur that the devised approaches, techniques, and methods provide a solid first step towards better comprehending real CPS unsolicited objectives and intents. As such, we hope that this paper motivates the literature to design secure and tailored CPS models that leverage tangible attacks and vulnerabilities inferred from empirical measurements, to achieve truly reliable and secure CPS.}

Intelligent integration of edge devices with Artificial Intelligence (AI) facilitates real-time analysis and decision making. However, these devices simultaneously provide additional attack opportunities for malware developers, potentially leading to information and financial loss. Machine learning approaches can detect such attacks but their performance degrades when benign samples substantially outnumber malware samples in training data. Existing approaches for such imbalanced data assume samples represented as continuous features and thus can generate invalid samples when malware applications are represented by binary features. We propose a novel malware oversampling technique that addresses this issue. Further, we propose two approaches for malware detection. Our first approach uses fuzzy set theory, while the second approach dynamically assigns higher priority to malware samples using a novel loss function. Combining our oversampling technique with these approaches, the proposed approach attains over 9% improvement over competing methods in terms of F1_score. Our approaches can, therefore, result in enhanced privacy and security in edge computing services.}

The early multi-stage attack detection methods focused on describing the detection rule based on the occurrence sequence of each single-stage attacks. That is, such works assumed that after details on single-stage attack behavior are obtained from attack knowledge, attack semantics or attack statistical analysis, the detection rules can be generated from their possible occurrence sequence. However, their practical usage is limited due to the high false negative ratio while detecting multi-stage attack that consists of diverse combinations of single-stage attacks during the long time period. In this paper, we propose a new multi-stage attack detection framework, which consists of multi-stage attack detection rule generation phase and multi-stage attack detection phase. After comparing the incoming traffics with the generated multi-stage attack detection rules, various multi-stage attack patterns are detected without pre-observed details on the single-stage attack behavior. From DARPA LLS DDoS dataset, we show that all the possible multi-stage attack patterns are correctly detected.

The logic behind of using generative model technique here is to learn the inherent latent structure of the attenuation signal from the data itself rather than its prior knowledge. Specifically, an estimate of the unknown signal will be learnt by means of an untrained generative model and it will be kept consistent with the observed measurement data. In the context of device-free localization of interest here, the L1 regularization is incorporated into the learning process, which will promote the sparsity of the solution. The experimental studies on device-free localization with radio tomographic imaging are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

abstract = {In complex networks systems like mobile edge infrastructures, real-time traffic classification according to application types is an enabling technique for network resource optimization and advanced security management. State-of-the-art schemes take advantage of machine learning techniques to train classification models based on behavioral characteristics of network traffic flows. Nonetheless, most existing studies assume complete a priori information of the application classes and formulate the task as a standalone multi-class classification problem. Such classification models cannot properly handle the unknown applications that are absent from the training set during the time of training. In this work, we propose a practical mobile network traffic classification scheme that builds robust classifiers based on incomplete a priori information. Specifically, the core idea is to extract the unknown patterns emerging in the network periodically to complement the initial labeled data set that only consists of a limited number of known applications. We propose two algorithms for the unknown pattern extraction step. One is based on iterative asymmetric binary classification and the other is based on constrained clustering. Empirical results based on a public data set show that the proposed scheme can effectively detect both known and unknown applications.}

It investigates whether the perceived traffic refers to probing activities and which exact scanning technique is being employed to perform the probing. Further, this work strives to examine probing traffic dimensions to infer the ‘machinery’ of the scan; whether the probing is random or follows a certain predefined pattern; which probing strategy is being employed; and whether the probing activity is generated from a software tool or from a worm/bot. The approach leverages a number of statistical techniques, probabilistic distribution methods and observations in an attempt to understand and analyze probing activities. To prevent evasion, the approach formulates this matter as a change point detection problem that yielded motivating results. Evaluations performed using 55 GB of real darknet traffic shows that the extracted inferences exhibit promising accuracy and can generate significant insights that could be used for mitigation purposes.}

These attacks are very similar to those against TCP protocol but have emerged at the application level of the Internet architecture. In this paper, we present a new approach to protect SIP devices from flooding attacks. Our proposed approach is mainly composed of two algorithms: 1) a detection algorithm that takes into consideration the temporal characteristics of SIP protocol as well as the fingerprints of its messages and 2) a mitigation algorithm that filters SIP messages based on a fingerprint whitelist database. We evaluate our approach through an extensive set of experimental tests using widely distributed virtual machines in the cloud and compare to similar approaches found in the literature. The experiments emulate a large flooding attack launched from mutually distant geographic data centers.

However, as most current and commercial AVs are closed-source solutions, in practice, little is known about their real internals: information such as what is a typical AV database size, the detection methods effectively used in each operation mode, and how often on average the AVs are updated are still unknown. This prevents research work from meeting the industrial practices more thoroughly. To fill this gap, in this work, we systematize the knowledge about AVs. To do so, we first surveyed the literature and identified existing knowledge gaps in AV internals’ working. Further, we bridged these gaps by analyzing popular (Windows, Linux, and Android) AV solutions to check their operations in practice. Our methodology encompassed multiple techniques, from tracing to fuzzing. We detail current AV’s architecture, including their multiple components, such as browser extensions and injected libraries, regarding their implementation, monitoring features, and self-protection capabilities. We discovered, for instance, a great disparity in the set of API functions hooked by the distinct AV’s libraries, which might have a significant impact in the viability of academically-proposed detection models (e.g., machine learning-based ones).}

Therefore, such an approach fails to deal with emerging threats that utilize unclassified observables, and to report suspicious activities of individual users. In this paper we propose MuSeR, a novel approach to assign reputation scores for observables, even when no prior information is available, and flag suspicious sessions by conducting inter-observable analysis of user requests. In essence, MuSeR opts to assist network and cloud administrators mitigate attacks while avoiding unwarranted blocking of benign access. MuSeR achieves such an objective by associating session reputation scores based on the trustworthiness of the user navigation pattern, and conducting dynamic analysis of individual observables involved within requests. Specifically, MuSeR employs a new machine learning model for classifying observables using features specifically chosen to factor in evidence provided by blacklists, and access patterns of known attacks. To determine a request score, MuSeR maps the classifier probabilities to adaptive subjective logic and then uses multinomial fusion to leverage evidence from the different observables. Given the request scores, MuSeR further promotes a novel session reputation scoring model that uses three-valued subjective logic to handle trust propagation and aggregation over user requests. The effectiveness ofMuSeR is validated using a large dataset obtained from popular databases such as WHOIS, CYMUS, and passive DNS databases.}

Firstly, two oracle character networks are constructed based on the context and shape of oracle rubbings and characters. Then, three module structure detection methods are employed to mine the modules from the oracle character networks. Through the experiments on the oracle character networks, three significant results are obtained. The first one is that oracle characters (or oracle variant characters) with similar semantics can be discovered by module structure, and the second one is that context and shape are of equal importance to the semantic formation of oracle characters. The last result is that modules have strong local topology of the network.}

abstract = {Real-time traffic crash prediction has been a major concern in the development of Collision Avoidance Systems (CASs) along with other intelligent and resilient transportation technologies. There has been a pronounced progress in the use of machine learning models for crash events assessment by the transportation safety research community in recent years. However, little attention has been paid so far to evaluating real-time crash occurrences within information fusion systems. The main aim of this paper is to design and validate an ensemble fusion framework founded on the use of various base classifiers that operate on fused features and a Meta classifier that learns from base classifiers’ results to acquire more performant crash predictions. A data-driven approach was adopted to investigate the potential of fusing four real-time and continuous categories of features namely physiological signals, driver maneuvering inputs, vehicle kinematics and weather covariates in order to systematically identify the crash strongest precursors through feature selection techniques. Moreover, a resampling-based scheme, including Bagging and Boosting, is conducted to generate diversity in learner combinations comprising Bayesian Learners (BL), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). To ensure that the proposed framework provide powerful and stable decisions, an imbalance-learning strategy was adopted using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE) to address the class imbalance problem as crash events usually occur in rare instances. The findings show that Boosting depicted the highest performance within the fusion scheme and can accomplish a maximum of 93.66% F1 score and 94.81% G-mean with Naïve Bayes, Bayesian Networks, k-NN and SVM with MLP as the Meta-classifier. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first attempt at establishing a fusing framework on the basis of data from the four aforementioned categories and fusion models while accounting for class imbalance. Overall, the method and findings provide new insights into crash prediction and can be harnessed as a promising tool to improve intervention efforts related to traffic intelligent transportation systems.}

abstract = {Concealing malicious components within widely used USB peripherals has become a popular attack vector utilizing social engineering techniques and exploiting users’ trust in USB devices. This vector enables the attacker to easily penetrate an organization's computers even when the target is secured or in an air-gapped network. Such malicious concealment can be done as part of a supply chain attack or during the device manufacturing process. In cases where the device allows the user to update its firmware, a supply chain attack may involve changing just the device's firmware, thus compromising the device without the need for concealment. A compromised device can impersonate other devices like keyboards in order to send malicious keystrokes to the computer. However, the keystrokes generated maliciously do not match human keystroke characteristics, and therefore they can be easily detected by security tools that are designed to continuously verify the user's identity based on his/her keystroke dynamics. In this paper, we present Malboard, a sophisticated attack based on designated hardware concealment, which automatically generates keystrokes that have the attacked user's behavioral characteristics; in this attack these keystrokes are injected into the computer in the form of malicious commands and thus can evade existing detection mechanisms designed to continuously verify the user's identity based on keystroke dynamics. We implemented this novel attack and evaluated its performance on 30 subjects performing three different keystroke tasks; we evaluated the attack against three existing detection mechanisms, and the results show that our attack managed to evade detection in 83–100% of the cases, depending on the detection tools in place. Malboard was proven to be effective in two scenarios: either by a remote attacker using wireless communication to communicate with Malboard or by an inside attacker (malicious employee) that physically operates and uses Malboard. In addition, in order to address the evasion gap, we developed three different modules aimed at detecting keystroke injection attacks in general, and particularly, the more sophisticated Malboard attack. Our proposed detection modules are trusted and secured, because they are based on three side-channel resources which originate from the interaction between the keyboard, user, and attacked host. These side-channel resources include (1) the keyboard's power consumption, (2) the keystrokes’ sound, and (3) the user's behavior associated with his/her ability to respond to displayed textual typographical errors. Our results showed that each of the proposed detection modules is capable of detecting the Malboard attack in 100% of the cases, with no misses and no false positives; using them together as an ensemble detection framework will assure that an organization is immune to the Malboard attack in particular and other keystroke injection attacks in general.}

Contrary to many other anomaly detection algorithms, TCN-AE is trained in an unsupervised manner. The algorithm demonstrates its efficacy on a comprehensive real-world anomaly benchmark comprising electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of patients with cardiac arrhythmia. TCN-AE significantly outperforms several other unsupervised state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms. Moreover, we investigate the contribution of the individual enhancements and show that each new ingredient improves the overall performance on the investigated benchmark.}

abstract = {In online marketplaces (e-commerce, cloud marketplaces), potential buyers/consumers do not have direct access to inspect the quality of products and services offered by retailers and service providers of marketplaces. Therefore, consumers have to trust the reputation system of the marketplace for making a meaningful decision whether they should have interaction with the particular service provider or not. Consumer’s feedback plays an important role while evaluating the trustworthiness of the service provider, but it brings challenges to security and the consumer’s privacy. Existing centralized reputation systems collect and process consumer’s feedback at the centralized trusted system but these systems could leak sensitive information of consumers (such as buying history, likes and dislikes). To ensure the privacy of consumers, in this paper, we present PrivBox, a privacy-preserving decentralized reputation system that computes reputation of retailers or service providers by leveraging feedback from users in a secure and private way. The PrivBox system uses primitives of a homomorphic cryptographic system and non-interactive zero-knowledge proof to achieve objectives of privacy-preservation and well-formedness. PrixBox performs its operations in a decentralized setting, and ensures the following characteristics. (1) It guarantees privacy of consumers without relying on any trusted setup or trusted third party system, (2) it ensures that the consumer’s feedback ratings remain within the prescribed range, and (3) it enables consumers and service providers to verify the computed statistics without relying on a trusted third party. To evaluate the performance, we have implemented operations of the PrivBox system. The results demonstrate that the proposed system has a small communication and computation overheads with the essential properties of privacy-preservation and decentralization.}

abstract = {With the continuous development of Internet of Things, the information society has gradually entered a new era of the Internet of everything. Sensor nodes are important sources of data in the Internet of Things. The abnormal and failure of sensing data in the Internet of Things will affect the connectivity of the network. If the accuracy and reliability of the corresponding perception data can be effectively improved, we can timely and accurately find out the emergency and monitor the working status of the network. Therefore, it is of great significance to detect the abnormal data of data streams in the sensor network nodes and confirm its source. For the low quality of sensor data collected in real time in IoT, this paper proposes an anomaly detection method for sensing data streams based on edge computing. In this algorithm, the sensor data is expressed in the form of time series. On the edge computing based sensor data anomaly detection model, the improved confidence interval is used to detect whether the data is abnormal. The concept of interval difference is proposed as the judgment of the source of the anomaly. The accuracy and effectiveness of the algorithm are verified by experiments. The results show that the detection rate of abnormal data is above 98%, which indicates that the algorithm has certain practicability.}

In this challenging scenario, security issues are increasing and several threats arise where network communications and systems are targeted for attacks. In order to counteract against them, new tools and methods need to be proposed. The Multivariate Statistical Network Monitoring (MSNM) is a promising methodology for anomaly detection as demonstrated in several works. In this work, the practical application of this methodology is tested by means of the tool called MSNM-Sensor. Its detection performance is evaluated in common and harmful network attacks included in recently built network datasets. In particular, authentication based and different Denial of Service attack (DoS) types are successfully detected by MSNM-Sensor as two of nowadays relevant and harmful security threats. In comparison to similar state of the art approaches, the MSNM-S outperforms them in almost all the types of DoS and Brute Force attacks considered in this work.}

abstract = {In the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) in the 5G era, the growth of smart devices will generate a large amount of data traffic, bringing a huge challenge of network traffic classification, which is the prerequisite of IIoT traffic engineering, quality of service (QoS), cyberspace security, etc. It is difficult for current traffic classification methods to distinguish encrypted dataflow and design effective handcraft features. In this paper, a novel identification scheme of encrypted traffic, TSCRNN, is proposed to automatically extract features for efficient traffic classification, which is based on spatiotemporal features. TSCRNN includes the preprocessing phase and the classification phase. In the preprocessing phase, raw traffic data are processed with flow segmentation, sampling, and vectorization, etc. To solve the classification problem of long time flow, sampling strategies are used to collect samples from the middle of the long-lived flow. In the classification phase, TSCRNN extracts abstract spatial features by CNN and then introduces stack bidirectional LSTM to learn the temporal characteristics. The experiments were performed on the dataset ISCXTor2016. The experimental results show that TSCRNN outperforms other typical methods in all scenarios, which achieves the accuracy up to 99.4% and 95.0% respectively in Tor/nonTor binary classification tasks and sixteen classification tasks. Furthermore, TSCRNN is applied to other real network datasets obtained the satisfactory performance, which validates its feasibility and universality. It means that TSCRNN can effectively identify encrypted and anonymous traffic, provide a fine-grained traffic characterization mechanism, which will support the development of core technologies in the Industrial Internet of Things.}

This is no surprise given the high number of reported data breach incidents annually, and the implication of these on the individuals or organisations targeted. Data exfiltration is a key stage in this form of cyber-attack, and the use of the Domain Name System protocol for data exfiltration is popular due to the essential nature of the protocol for network communication. This paper presents a DNS data exfiltration Protection (DNSxP) security architecture leveraging Software-Defined Networking and Data Plane Programmability. The solution is developed based on analysis of different malicious use cases for transmitting data over the DNS protocol. By performing coarse-grained packet filtering and analysis in the data plane, clear benign or malicious traffic can be identified quickly, while suspicious traffic is passed to additional security controls at the SDN controller for classification. As the results demonstrate, this approach offers the combined benefit of reducing data loss during an exfiltration attack and reducing network resource consumption.}

abstract = {Classifiers deployed in the real world operate in a dynamic environment, where the data distribution can change over time. These changes, referred to as concept drift, can cause the predictive performance of the classifier to drop over time, thereby making it obsolete. To be of any real use, these classifiers need to detect drifts and be able to adapt to them, over time. Detecting drifts has traditionally been approached as a supervised task, with labeled data constantly being used for validating the learned model. Although effective in detecting drifts, these techniques are impractical, as labeling is a difficult, costly and time consuming activity. On the other hand, unsupervised change detection techniques are unreliable, as they produce a large number of false alarms. The inefficacy of the unsupervised techniques stems from the exclusion of the characteristics of the learned classifier, from the detection process. In this paper, we propose the Margin Density Drift Detection (MD3) algorithm, which tracks the number of samples in the uncertainty region of a classifier, as a metric to detect drift. The MD3 algorithm is a distribution independent, application independent, model independent, unsupervised and incremental algorithm for reliably detecting drifts from data streams. Experimental evaluation on 6 drift induced datasets and 4 additional datasets from the cybersecurity domain demonstrates that the MD3 approach can reliably detect drifts, with significantly fewer false alarms compared to unsupervised feature based drift detectors. At the same time, it produces performance comparable to that of a fully labeled drift detector. The reduced false alarms enables the signaling of drifts only when they are most likely to affect classification performance. As such, the MD3 approach leads to a detection scheme which is credible, label efficient and general in its applicability.}

abstract = {This study proposes a novel probabilistically timed dynamic model for physical security attack scenarios on critical infrastructures (CIs). The model simulates attacker's attempts to compromise exploitable vulnerabilities in targeted CIs. Attacker's times to successfully compromise physical barriers, intrusion detection systems, and standby safety systems are modeled as random variables represented by user-defined probability distributions. The model assumes a highly skilled attacker, tracks his cumulative time to compromise targeted assets relative to an estimated mission time, and calculates mission success probability under imperfect information. The model uses Monte Carlo sampling technique to propagate uncertainties of input parameters to calculate statistics of mission success probability. Model's utility is demonstrated by a postulated case study in which an attacker attempts to launch undetected and unmitigated fire in 1-out-of-4 protected areas within a chemical process plant. Destroying one of these protected areas represents attacker's mission success in disrupting plant operation in addition to causing property damage. Visual flowcharting and dynamic attack tree logic are used to describe systematic execution of the attack. Simulation results show 64.4% mission success probability with 4.7% standard deviation. Benefits of proposed model include its use in security training to quantify probabilistic outcomes of “what if” scenarios, uncover exploitable vulnerabilities, and implement defensive strategies to improve CI's resilience under attack. The modeling framework can be extended to cyber security applications.}

GET flood attacks, commonly known as Application Layer DDoS attacks, are widely executed exploits that challenge almost all the web servers hosting such services on the Internet. The state-of-art literature provides many security mechanisms that are designed to handle such attacks, however, attackers constantly explore unique approaches for orchestrating covert GET flood attacks. The detection of such attacks requires user level monitoring due to a high resemblance among the browsing behaviors of legitimate users and modern-day sophisticated bots. In this paper, we propose four novel behavioral features to distinguish GET flood attack sources from the legitimate normal and flash traffic. Our work distinguishes itself from previous works by providing a comprehensive solution for the detection of 12 different strategies employed by an attacker to launch GET flood attacks. We build an experimental test bed supported by well-known software tools that replay the benchmark web logs and generate emulated attack traces pertaining to GET flood attack strategies. The datasets prepared during the course of this experimentation are evaluated through an exhaustive performance comparison of the selected set of machine learning classifiers. The obtained results evidently indicate significantly high detection accuracy (97.46%) with few false alarms using the SVM classifier.}

The opacity of encrypted traffic essentially requires high computational overheads to make traffic classification, which is even worse when encrypted traffic surges. However, existing deep learning approaches sacrifice the efficiency to obtain high-precision classification results, which are no longer suitable for scenarios with large volumes of encrypted traffic. In this paper, a lightweight and online approach implemented as MATEC is proposed. The way we optimize the classification process follows the “Maximizing the reuse of thin modules” design principle. The multi-head attention and the convolutional network are adopted in the thin module. Attributed to the one-step interaction of all packets and the parallel computing of the multi-head attention mechanism, a key advantage of our model is that the number of parameters and running time are significantly reduced. In addition, the effectiveness and efficiency of convolutional networks have been proved in traffic classification. Comparisons to the existing state-of-the-art models on three typical datasets demonstrate that the proposed MATEC model has higher accuracy and running efficiency. In addition, the number of parameters is reduced to 1.8% of the state-of-the-art models and the training time halves.}

It is aimed to deploy network edge that enables smart services and computation for the IoT devices. In addition, this deployment would not only improve the user experience but also provide service resiliency in case of any catastrophes. In IoT applications, the edge computing exploits distributed architecture and closeness of end-users to provide faster response and better quality of service. However, the security concern is majorly addressed to resist the vulnerability of attacks (VoA). Existing methodologies deal only with static wireless sensor web to deduce the intrusions in which the sensor nodes are deployed in a uniform manner to retain the constancy. Since the sensor nodes are constantly being in question through different transmission regions with several levels of velocities, selection of sensor monitoring nodes or guard nodes has become a challenging job in recent research. In addition, the adversaries are also moving from one location to another to explore its specific chores around the network. Thus, to provide flexible security, we propose a secure routing and monitoring protocol with multi-variant tuples using Two-Fish (TF) symmetric key approach to discover and prevent the adversaries in the global sensor network. The proposed approach is designed on the basis of the Authentication and Encryption Model (ATE). Using Eligibility Weight Function (EWF), the sensor guard nodes are selected and it is hidden with the help of complex symmetric key approach. A secure hybrid routing protocol is chosen to be built by inheriting the properties of both Multipath Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) and Ad hoc On-Demand Multipath Distance Vector (AOMDV) protocols. The result of the proposed approach is shown that it has a high percentage of monitoring nodes in comparison with the existing routing schemes. Moreover, the proposed routing mechanism is resilient to multiple mobile adversaries; and hence it ensures multipath delivery.}

The Internet of Things has spawned a new fleet of medical devices replete with improved sensing and actuating capabilities. Preemptive mitigation of the cyber risks that arise in this hyperconnected space is needed to ensure continued patient safety.
Objective
The aim of this paper is to analyse the robustness of existing policy measures in securing the Internet of Medical Things technologies. The regulatory ecosystem in the US is primarily discussed herein and includes regulatory frameworks for industry, public-private partnerships, and transparency initiatives.
Methods
A qualitative review of the medical cybersecurity literature was performed with collation of federal and international legal documents, policy reports, industry frameworks, cyberbreach analyses, and scientific journal articles.
Results
Regulatory guidance documents introduced to date that address cybersecurity in the Internet of Medical Things place a key emphasis on device identification, legacy device management, enhanced physical security, and breach detection. Recent oversight trends aim to bolster federal authority around the enforcement of baseline security safeguards.
Conclusions
Additional regulatory guidance is needed to mitigate risks in the Internet of Medical Things devices conferred by retrofitted IT infrastructures, edge-to-cloud interfaces, and off-the-shelf device components. Recent advancements in the cyber realm also raise the possibility of novel attack vectors, autonomous cyber-physical systems, and quantum computing threats. Interventions to promote awareness and security hygiene around the Internet of Medical Things devices can empower end users and facilitate smooth incident response.
Lay summary
The rise “Smart” technologies such as voice assistants and adaptable at-home appliances moves us closer to a more personalized world that can enhance our daily lives. The field of medicine will be changed by these next generation “Internet of Things” technologies that possess the ability to interact with their users and their surrounding environment. These technologies are important because the precision with which medical devices interact with patients, healthcare workers, and other technology can have huge impact on patient care. For all of their promise, the increased interconnectivity that these devices possess also confers additional cybersecurity risks. Policy regulation and public health preparedness are critical for ensuring the benefits of these emerging technologies do not come at the expense of patient safety and privacy. In this Review, we discuss cybersecurity regulation in the Internet of Medical Things and highlight novel threats still in need of address at the policy and public-health levels.}

abstract = {In the field of traditional industrial control, anomaly detection method is mainly used to identify data items that do not match the normal operation state of the system. The traditional machine learning algorithm needs the transient operation data of normal and accident conditions to identify the abnormal state of nuclear power plant. The transient operation data of nuclear power plant during normal condition is sufficient, but it is lacks of transient operation data in accident conditions. To solve the above problems, an abnormal operation state detection method of nuclear power plant based on unsupervised deep generative model is established by using Variational Auto Encoders (VAE) and Isolation Forest (iForest) in this paper. The biggest advantage of this method is that it can only make use of the normal operation data of the nuclear power plant to make the nuclear power plant control system effectively identify whether the current state of nuclear power plant is normal operation or in accident condition. In the unsupervised deep generative model, VAE is used for data preprocessing, and iForest is used to identify abnormal operation data. Then, the method is verified in seven variable and accident conditions, such as power reduction condition, steam generator tube rupture accident and so on. The verification results show that the anomaly detection method can recognize the current abnormal condition immediately when the accident happens. And the time consumed to identify a group of operation parameters corresponding to the operation state of the nuclear power plant is about 3 ms, which can satisfy the real-time requirements of the control system. Therefore, the anomaly detection method based on unsupervised deep generative model can distinguish the normal or abnormal operation state of the nuclear power plant in real time and effectively, and provide judgment basis for accident classification and subsequent rescue.}

Specifically, it functions by the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), or hypervisor. The reconstructed semantic details obtained by the VMI are available in a combination of benign and malicious states at the hypervisor. In order to distinguish between these two states, the existing out-of-VM security solutions require extensive manual analysis. In this paper, we propose an advanced VMM-based, guest-assisted Automated Internal-and-External (A-IntExt) introspection system by leveraging VMI, Memory Forensics Analysis (MFA), and machine learning techniques at the hypervisor. Further, we use the VMI-based technique to introspect digital artifacts of the live guest OS to obtain a semantic view of the processes details. We implemented an Intelligent Cross View Analyzer (ICVA) and implanted it into our proposed A-IntExt system, which examines the data supplied by the VMI to detect hidden, dead, and dubious processes, while also predicting early symptoms of malware execution on the introspected guest OS in a timely manner. Machine learning techniques are used to analyze the executables that are mined and extracted using MFA-based techniques and ascertain the malicious executables. The practicality of the A-IntExt system is evaluated by executing large real-world malware and benign executables onto the live guest OSs. The evaluation results achieved 99.55% accuracy and 0.004 False Positive Rate (FPR) on the 10-fold cross-validation to detect unknown malware on the generated dataset. Additionally, the proposed system was validated against other benchmarked malware datasets and the A-IntExt system outperforms the detection of real-world malware at the VMM with performance exceeding 6.3%.}

However, providing security and identifying the security threats to these technologies occupies the prime concern. This paper intends to provide an ample survey of security issues and their countermeasures encompassed in the technologies of 5G NR. Further, security concerns of each technology are defined mathematically. Thereby defining the impact on the factors of security. Moreover, a methodology is developed in which the influence on security due to artificially generated rain and artificially generated dust on the wireless communication network is studied. By doing so, an attacking scenario is identified, where a half-duplex attack in D2D communication is attained. Half-duplex attack specifies the attack solely on the downlink to spoof the allocated resources, with reduced miss-rate. Thus, ultra-reliable and adequate advances are required to be addressed to remove the obstacles that create a hindrance in achieving the secured and authenticated communicating network.}

There is a very real risk that today's vehicles are subjected to cyber-attacks that target vehicular communications. This paper proposes a three-layer framework (sensing, communication and control) through which automotive security threats can be better understood. The sensing layer is made up of vehicle dynamics and environmental sensors, which are vulnerable to eavesdropping, jamming, and spoofing attacks. The communication layer is comprised of both in-vehicle and V2X communications and is susceptible to eavesdropping, spoofing, man-in-the-middle, and sybil attacks. At the top of the hierarchy is the control layer, which enables autonomous vehicular functionality, including the automation of a vehicle's speed, braking, and steering. Attacks targeting the sensing and communication layers can propagate upward and affect the functionality and can compromise the security of the control layer. This paper provides the state-of-the-art review on attacks and threats relevant to the communication layer and presents countermeasures.}

Here, we take a step further showing that the human user can in fact be the strongest link for detecting attacks that involve deception, such as application masquerading, spearphishing, WiFi evil twin and other types of semantic social engineering. Towards this direction, we have developed a human-as-a-security-sensor framework and a practical implementation in the form of Cogni-Sense, a Microsoft Windows prototype application, designed to allow and encourage users to actively detect and report semantic social engineering attacks against them. Experimental evaluation with 26 users of different profiles running Cogni-Sense on their personal computers for a period of 45 days has shown that human sensors can consistently outperform technical security systems. Making use of a machine learning based approach, we also show that the reliability of each report, and consequently the performance of each human sensor, can be predicted in a meaningful and practical manner. In an organisation that employs a human-as-a-security-sensor implementation, such as Cogni-Sense, an attack is considered to have been detected if at least one user has reported it. In our evaluation, a small organisation consisting only of the 26 participants of the experiment would have exhibited a missed detection rate below 10%, down from 81% if only technical security systems had been used. The results strongly point towards the need to actively involve the user not only in prevention through cyber hygiene and user-centric security design, but also in active cyber threat detection and reporting.}

The patient's vitals sensed by the sensors are highly sensitive, confidential, and susceptible to various attacks from adversaries. For the WBAN being a concrete application of the healthcare system, it is paramount to ensure that the data sensed by the WBAN sensors is safe and not exposed to unauthorised entities and security threats. In light of this, strong security solutions and authentication schemes are needed for the success and large scale adoption of the WBANs. To this end, a plethora of security solutions and authentication schemes have been suggested by the researchers over the last two decades. However, the absence of a clear and cohesive study in view of security and authentication does not serve the bigger goal of providing a bird-eye view of the domain. To fulfill the objectives mentioned above, we approach in the following manner. Firstly, an extensive review of the security essentials, security threats, attackers, and attack techniques, and current existing solutions are provided with a detailed classification of security mechanisms in the WBANs. Secondly, a detailed discussion on authentication, design, and development of the authentication scheme and its classification, adversary models and security protocol verifiers is provided. Furthermore, this work outlines the applications, open research issues, recommendations for future authentication schemes and future trends for the WBANs. All in all, this survey elaborates the functionality of WBAN, its technologies, building blocks, and a much wider view of WBAN in terms of security and authentication.}

It is challenging to identify low-rate DoS attacks using traditional DoS defence mechanisms due to their low attack rate and stealthy nature. Most of the existing attack detection techniques are based on statistical analysis and signal processing. They usually show a high false negative rate and are only applicable to small-scale data. We propose a new low-rate DoS attack detection scheme based on the self-adaptive density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (SADBSCAN) algorithm. The SADBSCAN algorithm provides a solution to adaptively identify clusters in multidensity datasets. We use the SADBSCAN algorithm to group network traffic according to the characteristics of the network traffic subject to low-rate DoS attacks. Then, we use cosine similarity to determine whether the groups contain low-rate DoS attacks. To evaluate performance, we conducted experiments and compared the results with those of other detection solutions. The experimental data include data generated by the NS-2 and TestBed simulations and the WIDE public dataset. The results show that our scheme improves the detection accuracy, reduces the false negative rate, and can be adapted to large-scale complex network environments.}

It extensively uses sensing technologies (e.g., electronic health monitoring devices), computations (e.g., machine learning), and communication (e.g., interaction between the health data centers). As health data contain sensitive private information, including the identity of patient and carer and medical conditions of the patient, proper care is required at all times. Leakage of these private information affects the personal life, including bullying, high insurance premium, and loss of job due to the medical history. Thus, the security, privacy of and trust on the information are of utmost importance. Moreover, government legislation and ethics committees demand the security and privacy of healthcare data. Besides, the public, who is the data source, always expects the security, privacy, and trust of their data. Otherwise, they can avoid contributing their data to the precision health system. Consequently, as the public is the targeted beneficiary of the system, the effectiveness of precision health diminishes. Herein, in the light of precision health data security, privacy, ethical and regulatory requirements, finding the best methods and techniques for the utilization of the health data, and thus precision health is essential. In this regard, firstly, this paper explores the regulations, ethical guidelines around the world, and domain-specific needs.

Although database security mechanisms and network intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are present, they have been found to be inadequate or unsuitable in detecting threats specifically directed toward the database application layer. Therefore, an IDS especially for the database is needed. In this paper, we propose random forest with weighted voting (WRF) and principal components analysis (PCA) as a feature selection technique, for the task of detecting database access anomalies, assuming that the database has a role-based access control (RBAC) model in place. PCA produces uncorrelated and relevant features, and, at the same time, reduces dimensionality for easier integration with large databases. RF exploits the inherent tree-structure syntax of SQL queries, and its weighted voting scheme further minimizes false alarms. Experiments showed that not only does the WRF result in improved false-positive and false-negative rates, but it is also fast in terms of model building and anomaly detection time. Moreover, for a given query, RF classification accuracy was found to be significantly affected by the type of command and the tables accessed, which, in turn, explains the confusion between some role classes. Lastly, both RF and PCA outperforms other state-of-the-art data mining techniques for the task of database anomaly detection, and WRF achieved the best performance, even on very skewed data.}

Smart manufacturing is a key component of the broader thrust towards Industry 4.0, and relies on the creation of a bridge between digital and physical environments through Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, coupled with enhancements to those digital environments through greater use of cloud systems, data analytics and machine learning. Whilst these individual technologies have been in development for some time, their integration with industrial systems leads to new challenges as well as potential benefits. In this paper, we explore the challenges faced by those wishing to secure smart manufacturing systems. Lessons from history suggest that where an attempt has been made to retrofit security on systems for which the primary driver was the development of functionality, there are inevitable and costly breaches. Indeed, today's manufacturing systems have started to experience this over the past few years; however, the integration of complex smart manufacturing technologies massively increases the scope for attack from adversaries aiming at industrial espionage and sabotage. The potential outcome of these attacks ranges from economic damage and lost production, through injury and loss of life, to catastrophic nation-wide effects. In this paper, we discuss the security of existing industrial and manufacturing systems, existing vulnerabilities, potential future cyber-attacks, the weaknesses of existing measures, the levels of awareness and preparedness for future security challenges, and why security must play a key role underpinning the development of future smart manufacturing systems.}

Network forensics techniques assist in tracking internal and external network attacks by focusing on inherent network vulnerabilities and communication mechanisms. However, investigation of cybercrime becomes more challenging when cyber criminals erase the traces in order to avoid detection. Therefore, network forensics techniques employ mechanisms to facilitate investigation by recording every single packet and event that is disseminated into the network. As a result, it allows identification of the origin of the attack through reconstruction of the recorded data. In the current literature, network forensics techniques are studied on the basis of forensic tools, process models and framework implementations. However, a comprehensive study of cybercrime investigation using network forensics frameworks along with a critical review of present network forensics techniques is lacking. In other words, our study is motivated by the diversity of digital evidence and the difficulty of addressing numerous attacks in the network using network forensics techniques. Therefore, this paper reviews the fundamental mechanism of network forensics techniques to determine how network attacks are identified in the network. Through an extensive review of related literature, a thematic taxonomy is proposed for the classification of current network forensics techniques based on its implementation as well as target data sets involved in the conducting of forensic investigations. The critical aspects and significant features of the current network forensics techniques are investigated using qualitative analysis technique. We derive significant parameters from the literature for discussing the similarities and differences in existing network forensics techniques. The parameters include framework nature, mechanism, target dataset, target instance, forensic processing, time of investigation, execution definition, and objective function. Finally, open research challenges are discussed in network forensics to assist researchers in selecting the appropriate domains for further research and obtain ideas for exploring optimal techniques for investigating cyber-crimes.}

As an IoT-enabled paradigm, mobile crowdsensing (MCS) can offer more possibilities for data collection to support various IoT applications and services. As an extension, MCS can be used for data gathering amid COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Bridging Artificial Intelligence and IoT can achieve not only maintaining low infection rates of COVID-19 but can also facilitate an effective rapid testing strategy to reduce community spread. In this research, an intelligent strategy to deploy autonomous vehicle-based mobile testing facilities is proposed to enable early detection of infected cases based upon MCS data acquired through smart devices via wireless communications such as Wifi, LTE and 5G. To this end, a Self Organizing Feature Map is designed to manage MCS-based data for planning of the autonomous mobile assessment centers. Pre-identified zero-day locations and worst-case scenario are considered to determine the best combination for MCS participation rate and budget limitations. Numerical results demonstrate that once 30% of MCS participants are recruited, it becomes possible to cover the pre-identified zero-day locations and enable detection of infected cases under the worst case scenario to determine the AV routes more efficiently than other options for a certain number of neurons in SOFM. The worst-case scenario demonstrates that 30% participant rate ensures detection of infected cases in 27 days for 81 stops even infected cases are outside of the autonomous vehicle testing coverage.}

Different anomaly detectors are combined using the immunological paradigm to optimize reputation system performance in response to evolving security requirements. As an example, the experiments show how a combination of detectors based on unsupervised techniques (self-organizing maps and genetic algorithms) can help to significantly reduce the global response time of the reputation system. The proposed solution offers many benefits: scalability, fast response to adversarial activities, ability to detect unknown attacks, high adaptability, and high ability in detecting and confining attacks. For these reasons, we believe that our solution is capable of coping with the dynamism of ambient intelligence systems and the growing requirements of security demands.}

One of the challenging issues for network and system management operators is that of dealing with the huge amount of alerts generated by the managed systems and networks. In order to discover anomalous behaviors and speed up fault localization processes, alert correlation is one of the most popular resources. Although many different alert correlation techniques have been investigated, it is still an active research field. In this paper, a survey of the state of the art in alert correlation techniques is presented.

Due to its distributed nature, IoT is vulnerable to various attacks. In traditional packet attack, malicious nodes will indiscriminately attack packets. The existing detection algorithms can detect the attack by observing the overall behaviour of nodes. In this paper, we introduce an advanced attack named selective-edge packet attack, in which malicious nodes only attack packets sent to specific neighbours. Due to selectively attack packets, the attack is more covert than the traditional packet attack, which makes it difficult for the existing detection algorithms to detect. To detect selective-edge packet attack, we propose machine learning-based detection framework (MDMK) and machine learning-based detection algorithm (MDA) based on the framework, which uses regression algorithm and clustering algorithm to evaluate the reputation of communication links and nodes, and detects malicious nodes accordingly. To further improve the detection performance, machine learning-based detection algorithm with enhancement (MDAE) is designed by optimizing the routing path. The experimental results demonstrate that compared with the existing detection algorithms, the accuracy of MDA and MDAE in different situations is improved by around 7%–30% on average.}

This issue is known as dataset shift. Given that most statistical and machine learning techniques assume that the training sample is drawn from the same distribution as the test data used for evaluation, an appreciable amount of researchers and practitioners tend to ignore this issue at the model construction stage. In this paper, we propose a novel Fuzzy Support Vector Machine strategy, in which the traditional hinge loss function is redefined to account for dataset shift. Additionally, we propose a general version of this loss function applying aggregation operators in order to improve performance by dealing with dataset shift via fuzzy logic. Originally developed as linear approaches, our proposals are extended to kernel-based classification for non-linear machine learning. Our methods are able to perform best compared to traditional classifiers in terms of out-of-time prediction using simulated and real-world dataset for credit scoring, confirming the theoretical virtues of our approach.}

abstract = {The Botnets have become one of the most serious threats to cyber infrastructure. Most existing work on detecting botnets is based on flow-based traffic analysis by mining their communication patterns. There also exists related work based on anomaly detection in communication graphs. As bots have continuously evolved and become increasingly sophisticated, only using flow-based traffic analysis or graph-based analysis for the detection would result in false negatives or false positives, or can even be evaded. In this work, we propose BotMark, an automated model that detects botnets with hybrid analysis of flow-based and graph-based network traffic behaviors. We extract 15 statistical flow-based traffic features as well as 3 graph-based features in building the detection model. For flow-based detection, we consider the similarity and stability of C-flow as measurements in the detection. In particular, we employ k-means to measure the similarity of C-flows and assign similarity scores, and calculate stability score of C-flows through the distribution of packet length within a C-flow. The graph-based detection is based on the observation that the neighborhoods of anomalous nodes significantly differ from those of normal nodes in communication graphs. In particular, we use least-square technique and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) to calculate anomaly scores that measure the differences of their neighborhoods. Our models use the scores to mark bots. BotMark performs automated botnet detection with hybrid analysis of flow-based and graph-based traffic behaviors by ensemble of the detection results based on similarity scores, stability scores and anomaly scores. We collect a very large size of network traffic by simulating 5 newly propagated botnets, including Mirai, Black energy, Zeus, Athena and Ares in a real computing environment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of BotMark. It achieves 99.94% in terms of detection accuracy, outperforming any individual detector with flow-based detection or graph-based detection.}

Thereby, they become much less interpretable to the data scientists applying the algorithms in real-life settings and to end-users using their predictions. We argue that outliers are context-dependent and, therefore, can only be detected via domain knowledge, algorithm insight, and interaction with end-users. As outlier detection is equivalent to unsupervised semantic binary classification, at the core of interpreting an outlier algorithm we find the semantics of the classes, i.e., the algorithm’s conceptual outlier definition. We investigate current interpretable and explainable outlier algorithms: what they are, for whom they are, and what their value proposition is. We then discuss how interpretation and explanation and user involvement have the potential to provide the missing link to bring modern complex outlier algorithms from computer science labs into real-life applications and the challenges they induce.}

With trust-based misbehaving node detection as an application, we demonstrate how our proposed COI trust management protocol is resilient to node failure, disconnection and capture events, and can help maximize application performance in terms of minimizing false negatives and positives in the presence of mobile nodes exhibiting vastly distinct QoS and social behaviors.}

VoIP/SIP techniques are used widely in unified communication systems and next generation networks, and there is no doubt they will play increasingly important roles in the future of communication techniques. However, unlike transmission control protocol (TCP)-based applications, the user datagram protocol (UDP)-based VoIP/SIP applications are not as mature and they have some security vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is crucial to study VoIP/SIP-related security issues. In this study, we investigated the existing vulnerabilities in the SIP protocol and identify new vulnerabilities in the SIP retransmission mechanisms, which could be exploited by denial-of-service (DoS)/distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. We prepared a VoIP/SIP security laboratory environment and a DDoS attack simulator. We developed two advanced attacks by exploiting the vulnerabilities identified in the SIP retransmission mechanism and we implemented these attacks in our laboratory environment using the DoS/DDoS attack simulator. Our intelligent attacks could bypass black-lists as well as IP-based rate limiting, packet count-based rate limiting, session/transaction-based rate limiting, and automatic message generation detection systems in the existing state-of-the-art security perimeters, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, and anomaly detection systems. Furthermore, we developed a novel defense mechanism to effectively combat the proposed attacks and we implemented it successfully in our VoIP/SIP security laboratory environment. We showed that our defense mechanism reduced the CPU load of a SIP server under attack from 87% down to 13.6%.}

They are expected, from these alerts, to make reliable and timely decisions regarding the types of ongoing attack scenarios and their priorities. However, the lack of an agreed-upon vocabulary for the representation of the domain knowledge makes it difficult for state-of-the-art SIEM systems to effectively manage these complex decisions. To overcome this problem, an ontology-based expert system approach can provide domain knowledge modeling as a foundation for disambiguation of meaning and automatic reasoning regarding ongoing attack scenarios. The proposed approach reconstructs attack scenarios by reasoning based on the evidences in the alert stream. The main idea of the proposed approach is to identify the causal relation between alerts using their similarity. This approach assumes that the similarity between two successive steps in an attack scenario is greater than that of two non-successive steps. Moreover, the similarity between the steps of the same attack scenario is greater than that between the steps of two different attack scenarios. The benefit of the proposed approach includes the fast and incremental reconstruction of known and unknown attack scenarios without expert intervention, which is an enormous step forward in developing expert and intelligent systems for cyber security. We evaluated the proposed technique by performing experiments on two known datasets: DARPA 2000 and MACCDC 2012. The results prove the advantages of the proposed approach with regard to completeness and soundness criteria.}

Recent works have shown, on small-scale experiments, the possibility of evading anti-malware engines by applying simple obfuscation transformations on previously detected malware samples. In this paper, we provide a large-scale experiment in which the detection performances of a high number of anti-malware solutions are tested against two different sets of malware samples that have been obfuscated according to different strategies. Moreover, we show that anti-malware engines search for possible malicious content inside assets and entry-point classes. We also provide a temporal analysis of the detection performances of anti-malware engines to verify if their resilience has improved since 2013. Finally, we show how, by manipulating the area of the Android executable that contains the strings used by the application, it is possible to deceive anti-malware engines so that they will identify legitimate samples as malware. On one hand, the attained results show that anti-malware systems have improved their resilience against trivial obfuscation techniques. On the other hand, more complex changes to the application executable have proved to be still effective against detection. Thus, we claim that a deeper static (or dynamic) analysis of the application is needed to improve the robustness of such systems.}

The Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is such a devastating security problem. In this work, a comprehensive review of the DDoS detection mechanisms utilized in SDN is presented. DDoS attacks in SDN are classified into two types and five subtypes based on the features of DDoS and SDN. For each kind of DDoS, how the attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities of SDN to launch DDoS attacks is discussed. Subsequently, the DDoS detection mechanisms used in SDN are reviewed and categorized into five types and forty-six subtypes. These kinds of DDoS detection mechanisms are compared and analyzed, where we draw a conclusion that the machine learning-based DDoS detection mechanisms and threshold-based DDoS detection mechanisms are the two most popular technologies utilized to detect DDoS attacks in SDN. More importantly, for each kind of DDoS detection mechanism, the generational process, advantages, and disadvantages are discussed. Additionally, the open problems and future directions of DDoS detection in SDN are discussed. By presenting these review, discussion and analysis, we hope it can facilitate the understanding of DDoS detection in SDN.}

However, despite the many articles published to support the research activities, there is still no trace of any bibliometric report that demonstrates the research trends. This paper aims to fill in that gap by presenting a comprehensive evaluation of malware research practices.

Using bibliometric analysis, this paper discusses the research activities done in both North America, Asia and other continents. This paper performed a detailed analysis by looking at the number of articles published, citations, research area, keywords, institutions, terms, and authors. A summary of the research activities continues by listing the terms into a classification of malware detection system which underlines the important area of malware research. From the analysis, it was concluded that there are several significant impacts of research activities in Asia, in comparison to other continents.

The ongoing deployment of 5G cellular systems is continuously exposing the inherent limitations of this system, which promote the exploration of 6th generation mobile networks (6G). However, development is bound to be challenging. The complex network environment, rapidly growing data volume and new types of network attacks and anomalies will become an obstacle to network security protection. To solve these problems, we propose a novel parallel subagging-GRU-based network traffic anomaly detection method (PSB-GRU) for identifying anomalies in the network. Considering the advantages of gated recurrent unit (GRU) self-learning and long-term dependency processing, we use it as the main structure of anomaly detection, and we use a genetic algorithm (GA) to realize the intelligentization of its training process. In addition, we introduce the Spark platform to parallelize the detection process and improve detection efficiency. Additionally, to reduce the variance and mean square error in all order terms and improve the generalization ability of the detection model, we utilize a subagging algorithm to reinforce the detection model. Finally, we compare our anomaly detection method with some existing algorithms and show that the anomaly detection performance of the proposed method is better than that of the recurrent neural network methods (RNN, LSTM and GRU).}

This adoption increases the system attack-surface and the number of cyber threats capable of harmful business impact, such as leak of business data, disruption of business operations, and loss of reputation, intellectual property and financial assets. A supply chain network thus needs an effective cyber security and threat management strategy, which requires reaching a thorough understanding of the most important assets and resources in a supply chain traceability system, the cyber threats that may impact them, and potential countermeasures. This article contributes a comprehensive threat modeling report on supply chain traceability systems, where we make explicit more than a hundred relations between assets, threats and countermeasures of relevance to supply chain traceability. Our analysis is reproducible, extensible and falsifiable. Reproducibility is achieved by following a systematic asset-centric threat modeling approach and adopting the STRIDE threat model to present a description of common threats; extensibility by using a layered-architecture for supply chains which the analyst can accommodate to a concrete implementation; and falsifiability by providing the sources used to establish the relation (asset, threat, countermeasure). Albeit the focus of the analysis is on technology, for the sake of completeness, the article briefly analyses secure traceability in supply chains when people and processes are made part of the system.}

A procedure to choose the more discriminant distribution of beacons is presented, as well as its empirical validation, based on data provided by a commercial RTLS used by a mobile robot for indoor navigation. In the evaluation, three basic alternatives to define the distribution of beacons were considered to see which one was more discriminant, that is, the one with more differences. Statistical differences in the data gathered by the mobile robot, when the localization system is under attack, and when it is not, have been found.

However, the existing literature lacks a thorough survey to summarize, compare and analyze the recent advances of network traffic classification in order to deliver a holistic perspective. This paper carefully reviews existing network traffic classification methods from a new and comprehensive perspective by classifying them into five categories based on representative classification features, i.e., statistics-based classification, correlation-based classification, behavior-based classification, payload-based classification, and port-based classification. A series of criteria are proposed for the purpose of evaluating the performance of existing traffic classification methods. For each specified category, we analyze and discuss the details, advantages and disadvantages of its existing methods, and also present the traffic features commonly used. Summaries of investigation are offered for providing a holistic and specialized view on the state-of-art.

abstract = {Malware programs currently represent the most serious threat to computer information systems. Despite the performed efforts of researchers in this field, detection tools still have limitations for one main reason. Actually, malware developers usually use obfuscation techniques consisting in a set of transformations that make the code and/or its execution difficult to analyze by hindering both manual and automated inspections. These techniques allow the malware to escape the detection tools, and hence to be seen as a benign program. To solve the obfuscation issue, many researchers have proposed to extract frequent Application Programming Interface (API) call sequences from previously encountered malware programs using pattern mining techniques and hence, build a base of fraudulent behaviors. Based on this process, it is worth mentioning that the performance of the detection process heavily depends on the base of examples of malware behaviors; also called malware patterns. In order to deal with this shortcoming, a dynamic detection method called Artificial Malware-based Detection (AMD) is proposed in this paper. AMD makes use of not only extracted malware patterns but also artificially generated ones. The artificial malware patterns are generated using an evolutionary (genetic) algorithm. The latter evolves a population of API call sequences with the aim to find new malware behaviors following a set of well-defined evolution rules. The artificial fraudulent behaviors are subsequently inserted into the base of examples in order to enrich it with unseen malware patterns. The main motivation behind the proposed AMD approach is to diversify the base of malware examples in order to maximize the detection rate. AMD has been tested on different Android malware data sets and compared against recent prominent works using commonly employed performance metrics. The performance analysis of the obtained results shows the merits of our AMD novel approach.}

These data can be obtained by attackers with malicious code added to SQL queries. The malicious and clean SQL queries are taken from OWASP dataset to ensure that the proposed approach effective and practical. The middleware application which is developed in this study analyzes these SQL queries instantly to prevent attackers from accessing sensitive data in databases. In order to provide protection, an ensemble classification algorithm is trained with 22 features which are obtained from queries containing malicious codes. The trained ensemble algorithm classifies queries as clean and malicious. For the first time in this study, malicious SQL injections are detected as simple, unified or lateral to determine the level of the cyber-attack. If the query is clean, the request is provided in the flow forwarding scheme, otherwise the query is blocked. If SQL injection is detected as simple, the SQL request is blocked. In other cases source IP address is blocked at different time intervals. The accuracy of the model maintains over 98% to detect SQL injections, and 92% to classify as simple, unified or lateral these attacks. This result demonstrates that the developed middleware application has an active role against simple, unified and lateral SQL Injection attacks which are so hard to detect and provides flexible decisions against the attacks.}

In recent years, however, there have been several data breaches and other security and privacy incidents involving IoT devices, which have attracted significant attention from the research community in both academia and industry. This has resulted in a surge of proposals put forward by many researchers, including IoT blockchain-based security solutions, IoT intrusion detection systems, IoT authentication systems, and IoT security analytics. While these proposals are aimed at addressing various IoT security and privacy-related issues, many of these solutions arguably seem not to focus on helping designers and developers with little or no security expertise in start-up companies to produce secure IoT systems. To this end, the IoT Hardware Platform Security Advisor (IoT-HarPSecA) framework was proposed to foster the design and implementation of secure IoT systems. In this paper, we present the performance and usability evaluation of the Security Requirements Elicitation (SRE) and Security Best Practice Guidelines (SBPG) component tools of IoT-HarPSecA, which are two of the three component tools of the security framework. Results show that the two components of the IoT-HarPSecA framework can facilitate the development of secure IoT systems and that the SRE and SBPG tools are easy to use.}

Various studies have been conducted for a long time to solve this problem, and many solutions have recently been developed to perform real-time health monitoring by attaching sensors to facilities. In addition, machine learning has allowed more accurate diagnosis of the condition to be carried out on these collected data. However, real-time fault detection is accompanied by a number of difficulties. Class imbalance issues are considered one of the most representative factors that makes it difficult to apply machine learning models in real-world locations. Class imbalance means that when it comes to classification problems, the amount of data in one class is greater than that in another class. In this case, the machine learning model is overfitted to a class with a lot of data, causing performance degradation. In real-world sites, the performance degradation of the model due to class imbalance is very serious because most data occurs in normal state, while fault data does not occur very well. Several prior studies have proposed ways to overcome this class imbalance, but each has several limitations. In this paper, an algorithm solution method and computing architecture solution method are introduced together as methodologies to overcome class imbalance, and a robust classification model is designed for class imbalance.}

However, this flexibility of P2P systems introduces security vulnerabilities. Peers often interact with unknown or unfamiliar peers and become vulnerable to a wide variety of attacks. Therefore, having a robust trust management model is critical for such open environments in order to exclude unreliable peers from the system. In this study, a new trust model for peer-to-peer networks called GenTrust is proposed. GenTrust has evolved by using genetic programming. In this model, a peer calculates the trustworthiness of another peer based on the features extracted from past interactions and the recommendations. Since the proposed model does not rely on any central authority or global trust values, it suits the decentralized nature of P2P networks. Moreover, the experimental results show that the model is very effective against various attackers, namely individual, collaborative, and pseudospoofing attackers. An analysis on features is also carried out in order to explore their effects on the results. This is the first study which investigates the use of genetic programming on trust management.}

Therefore, anomaly detection could stop a minor problem becoming overwhelming. Moreover, it will aid in better decision-making to reduce wasted energy and promote sustainable and energy efficient behavior. In this regard, this paper is an in-depth review of existing anomaly detection frameworks for building energy consumption based on artificial intelligence. Specifically, an extensive survey is presented, in which a comprehensive taxonomy is introduced to classify existing algorithms based on different modules and parameters adopted, such as machine learning algorithms, feature extraction approaches, anomaly detection levels, computing platforms and application scenarios. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first review article that discusses anomaly detection in building energy consumption. Moving forward, important findings along with domain-specific problems, difficulties and challenges that remain unresolved are thoroughly discussed, including the absence of: (i) precise definitions of anomalous power consumption, (ii) annotated datasets, (iii) unified metrics to assess the performance of existing solutions, (iv) platforms for reproducibility and (v) privacy-preservation. Following, insights about current research trends are discussed to widen the applications and effectiveness of the anomaly detection technology before deriving future directions attracting significant attention.

Unfortunately, Office documents can contain malicious components and perform harmful operations. Attackers increasingly take advantage of naive users and leverage Office documents in order to launch sophisticated advanced persistent threat (APT) and ransomware attacks. Recently, targeted cyber-attacks against organizations have been initiated with emails containing malicious attachments. Since most email servers do not allow the attachment of executable files to emails, attackers prefer to use of non-executable files (e.g., documents) for malicious purposes. Existing anti-virus engines primarily use signature-based detection methods, and therefore fail to detect new unknown malicious code which has been embedded in an Office document. Machine learning methods have been shown to be effective at detecting known and unknown malware in various domains, however, to the best of our knowledge, machine learning methods have not been used for the detection of malicious XML-based Office documents (*.docx, *.xlsx, *.pptx, *.odt, *.ods, etc.). In this paper we present a novel structural feature extraction methodology (SFEM) for XML-based Office documents. SFEM extracts discriminative features from documents, based on their structure. We leveraged SFEM’s features with machine learning algorithms for effective detection of malicious *.docx documents. We extensively evaluated SFEM with machine learning classifiers using a representative collection (16,938 *.docx documents collected "from the wild") which contains ∼4.9% malicious and ∼95.1% benign documents. We examined 1,600 unique configurations based on different combinations of feature extraction, feature selection, feature representation, top-feature selection methods, and machine learning classifiers. The results show that machine learning algorithms trained on features provided by SFEM successfully detect new unknown malicious *.docx documents. The Random Forest classifier achieves the highest detection rates, with an AUC of 99.12% and true positive rate (TPR) of 97% that is accompanied by a false positive rate (FPR) of 4.9%. In comparison, the best anti-virus engine achieves a TPR which is ∼25% lower.}

To this end, we aim to investigate the viability of using sonified network datasets to enable humans to detect (recognise the presence of some) and identify (understand the type of) network attacks. In this paper we report the results of a user study in which we assessed the utility of a network-traffic sonification system for representing network attacks. Our results show that by listening to the sonified network data, participants could detect attacks accurately and efficiently, including combinations of attacks, and identify the types of attacks. Musical experience had no significant effect on the ability of participants to use the sonification, and participants could detect attacks without training, yet improved performance through training. The results support the potential of sonification for use in network-security monitoring tasks.}

Furthermore, outbreaks of new malware often cannot provide a large quantity of training samples for machine-learning-based approaches to counter malware campaigns. The malware defense system should aim to achieve the best balance between early detection and detection accuracy. In this paper, we present a situation-aware access control framework to work with existing file systems as a stackable add-on. Our framework enables the access control decision making to be deferred when required, to observe the consequence of such an access request to the file system and to roll back changes if required. As an application against ransomware attacks, it can be applied to preserve file content integrity, by enforcing that all binary files written to the file system have consistent internal file structures with the declared file types, and rolling back changes that violate such constraints. We envision our access control framework to complement existing operating system access control frameworks, to significantly reduce the dimension of data required for machine learning, and to build extra resilience into the operating systems against damages caused by either malware or software defects. We demonstrate the practicality of our framework through a prototype testing, capturing relevant ransomware situations. The experimental results along with a large ransomware dataset show that our framework can be effectively applied in practice.}

Three schemes of the proposed approach are investigated, which are: using raw data, using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction, and using 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based encoder for temporal feature extraction.

With more and more critical applications relying on sensor readings to make important decisions, defending sensors from these attacks is of prime importance. In this work we present practical software based defenses against attacks on two common types of position sensors, specifically the gyroscope and the magnetometer. We first characterize the sensitivity of these sensors to acoustic and magnetic adversaries. Next, we present two software-only defenses: a machine learning-based single sensor defense, and a sensor fusion defense which makes use of the mathematical relationship between the two sensors. We performed a detailed theoretical analysis of our defenses, and implemented them on a variety of smartphones, as well as on a resource-constrained IoT sensor node. Our defenses do not require any hardware or OS-level modifications, making it possible to use them with existing hardware.

Such datasets often include sensitive information, yet most recommender systems are focusing on the models’ accuracy and ignore issues related to security and the users’ privacy. Despite the efforts to overcome these problems using different risk reduction techniques, none of them has been completely successful in ensuring cryptographic security and protection of the users’ private information. To bridge this gap, the blockchain technology is presented as a promising strategy to promote security and privacy preservation in recommender systems, not only because of its security and privacy salient features, but also due to its resilience, adaptability, fault tolerance and trust characteristics.

abstract = {Sensing and relaying are the primary tasks of sensor nodes in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Hence the recent research focus has been to devise secure, energy efficient ways to predict, aggregate and recover sensor data. In this paper, a novel method for secure data prediction in WSN has been proposed by using a Time Series Trust Model (TSTM) based on Toeplitz matrix and a Trust based Auto Regressive (TAR) process. The impact of the proposed trust model in data prediction and Compressed Sensing (CS) based aggregation and reconstruction is validated using various performance metrics and different attack models. The TAR model for prediction is evaluated against three different attack models. The proposed TSTM model outperformed existing trust model for varying percentage of compromised nodes. TSTM based data reconstruction using the Basis Pursuit (BP) algorithm registers best performance when the percentage of compromised nodes varies between 10% and 40% due to bad mouthing attack.}

abstract = {The automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) represents a major change in flight tracking and it is one of the key components in building the next generation of air transportation systems. However, several concerns have been raised regarding its vulnerabilities to cyber attacks. In recent years, a new and promising approach of utilizing large-scale and publicly available flight recordings for training machine learning models that can detect anomalous flight patterns has been demonstrated as a valid countermeasure for several ADS-B attacks. The new approach differs significantly from previously proposed methods in the simplicity of its integration with the current ADS-B system. It also provides a valid countermeasure against highly sophisticated airborne attackers. However, previously proposed machine learning methods require training a different model for each flight route or geographic location to give acceptable results. This requirement limits the current solution to flights with a sufficient amount of historical data, which is unavailable in many cases such as business aviation, instructional flying, aerial work, and more. In this research, we address this limitation of previous work, by applying a differencing time-series transformation on the ADS-B data and utilizing a non-recurrent autoencoder classifier. The effectiveness of our method is compared to existing methods on several simulated trajectory modification attacks. The results of our experiments show that the proposed method achieves a ROC AUC value of 0.935-0.951, in comparison to 0.627 from existing methods when evaluated on flights that are absent from training data.}

The proposed tests are based on sample location and dispersion and derived from relatively unknown Zero Order Statistics. The proposed tests are non-parametric and suitable for a range of applications to heavy-tailed data analysis outside of network traffic. The performance of these tests is examined using two different real-world denial-of-service attacks contained in actual high-volume backbone traffic. The proposed tests outperform traditional metrics such as mean and variance due to the presence of heavy tails in the network traffic, a frequent characteristic of traffic in actual networks. Monte Carlo analysis is used to quantify the performance gains and show an improvement in accuracy between 7 and 11% at very low false alarm rates. The proposed tests also demonstrate equivalent or superior performance to the median, a common robust statistic. Constructive timing of key system processes is used to demonstrate near real-time performance. Three- and six- second data windows containing between 750 and 1200 elements can be processed in less than one second using commodity hardware running unoptimized code. These timing results imply scalability to a variety of networks and commercial applications. Scalability prospects are further enhanced by demonstrating resilient detection performance at attack volumes between 25 and 100 percent of baseline rates in both real and generated traffic.}

The AIS approaches have been divided into three main categories based on IoT layers, and detailed classifications have also been included based on different parameters. To achieve this aim, the authors use a systematic literature review (SLR) as a powerful method to collect and critically analyze the research papers. Also, the authors discuss the selected studies and their main techniques, as well as their benefits and drawbacks in general.

These demands need reliable high-speed networks, that can optimize performance for application data flows. Characterizing flows into large flows (elephant) versus small flows (mice) can allow networks to optimize performance by detecting and handling demands in real-time. However, predicting elephant versus mice flows is extremely difficult as their definition varies based on networks. Machine learning techniques can help classify flows into two distinct clusters to identify characteristics of transfers. In this paper, we investigate unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning approaches to classify flows in real time. We develop a Gaussian Mixture Model combined with an initialization algorithm, to develop a novel general-purpose method to help classification based on network sites (in terms of data transfers, flow rates and durations). Our results show that the proposed algorithm is able to cluster elephants and mice with an accuracy rate of 90%. We analyzed NetFlow reports of 1 month from 3 ESnet site routers to train the model and predict clusters.}

abstract = {A covert timing channel is a hidden communication channel based on network timing that an attacker can use to sneak secrets out of a secure system. Active covert channels, in which the attacker uses a program to automatically generate innocuous traffic to use as a medium for embedding the covert channel, are especially problematic, as they allow the attacker to output large amounts of secret data. Further, it is relatively easy to create an active covert channel that outputs traffic with the same delay distribution as legitimate traffic. However, these channels are generally detectable due to their regularity – as they are generate by a computer program, they do not have the variations found in human-generated traffic. In this work, we show how to build a an active covert channel that generates traffic in a purposefully irregular manner. In particular, we propose Mimic, an active covert channel that mimics both the shape and regularity of legitimate traffic to disguise its presence. Mimic includes two modules, a shape modeler and a regularity modeler, for learning about the statistical properties of real traffic and generating traffic with the same properties. The main novelty of Mimic stems from its ability to produce irregular patterns similar to those of legitimate traffic while maintaining the distribution shape. To measure the effectiveness of our mechanism, we run experiments for both detection and throughput over a LAN and over the Internet. Our results show that Mimic can generate channels with a wide range of regularity values, making it undetectable by any known detection technique, without sacrificing channel capacity.}

International organizations around the world are alerting the scientific community to the need for protection of CIs, especially through preparedness and prevention mechanisms. One of the main tools available in this area is the use of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). However, in order to deploy this type of component within a CI, especially within its Control System (CS), it is necessary to verify whether the characteristics of a given IDS solution are compatible with the special requirements and constraints of a critical environment. In this paper, we carry out an extensive study to determine the requirements imposed by the CS on the IDS solutions using the Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) Framework. The outcome of this process are the abstract properties that the IDS needs to satisfy in order to be deployed within a CS, which are refined through the identification of satisficing techniques for the NFRs. To provide quantifiable measurable evidence on the suitability of the IDS component for a CI, we broaden our study using the Goal Question Metric (GQM) approach to select a representative set of metrics. A requirements model, refined with satisficing techniques and sets of metrics which help assess, in the most quantifiable way possible, the suitability and performance of a given IDS solution for a critical scenario, constitutes the results of our analysis.}

abstract = {Detecting anomalous discrete sequences such as payloads and syscall traces is a crucial task of network security analysis for discovering novel attacks. The data characteristics that lack of labels, very long sequences and irregularly variable lengths make generating proper representations for the sequences for anomaly detection quite challenging. Traditional methods combining shallow models with feature engineering require lots of time and effort from researchers. And they only catch short patterns for the sequences. Recently deep learning is paid more and more attention due to its excellent performance on data representation. Current works simply adopt recurrent neural network based models to this task. They learn the local patterns of the sequences but can not view the sequences globally. Besides, the variable length makes the deep models that accept fixed-size inputs unavailable. Moreover, the deep models usually lack interpretability. Here an unsupervised deep learning framework utilizing attention mechanism called ADSAD is proposed to address these issues. ADSAD takes both the data characteristics and the limitation of the deep models into consideration and generate the global representations for the sequences by two steps, in which the attention mechanism is applied to improve the interpretability. The empirical results showed that the ADSAD instances significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art deep models, with the relative AUC improvement of up to 7%. The attention mechanism not only enhanced the detection performance by up to 73% in terms of AUC but was also able to assist experts for anomaly analysis by visualization.}

However, it is difficult to identify the section distribution information such as the number, order, and size of sections from the current gray images converted by the binary sequences of PE files. Therefore, this article proposes a novel visualization method that introduces the Colored Label boxes (CoLab) to mark the sections of a PE file to further emphasize the section distribution information in the converted malware image. Moreover, a malware classification method called MalCVS (Malware classification using CoLab image, VGG16, and Support vector machine) is constructed. The experimental results of the malware collected from VX-Heaven and Virusshare as well as the Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge dataset showed that MalCVS can effectively classify malware into families with high accuracy. The average accuracies of MalCVS are respectively 96.59% and 98.94% on the two datasets.}

In this paper, we present our own prototype of SIEM system, which is capable of dealing with these issues. For efficient data processing, our system employs in-memory data storage (SAP HANA) and our own technologies from the previous work, such as the Object Log Format (OLF) and high-speed event normalisation. We analyse normalised data using a combination of three different approaches for security analysis: misuse detection, query-based analytics, and anomaly detection. Compared to the previous work, we have significantly improved our unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms. Most importantly, we have developed a novel hybrid outlier detection algorithm that returns ranked clusters of anomalies. It lets an operator of a SIEM system to concentrate on the several top-ranked anomalies, instead of digging through an unsorted bundle of suspicious events. We propose to use anomaly detection in a combination with signatures and queries, applied on the same data, rather than as a full replacement for misuse detection. In this case, the majority of attacks will be captured with misuse detection, whereas anomaly detection will highlight previously unknown behaviour or attacks. We also propose that only the most suspicious event clusters need to be checked by an operator, whereas other anomalies, including false positive alerts, do not need to be explicitly checked if they have a lower ranking. We have proved our concepts and algorithms on a dataset of 160 million events from a network segment of a big multinational company and suggest that our approach and methods are highly relevant for modern SIEM systems.}

The challenges these questions pose also brings pitfalls that affect the multiple malware research stakeholders. To help answering those questions and to highlight potential research pitfalls to be avoided, in this paper, we present a systematic literature review of 491 papers on malware research published in major security conferences between 2000 and 2018. We identified the most common pitfalls present in past literature and propose a method for assessing current (and future) malware research. Our goal is towards integrating science and engineering best practices to develop further, improved research by learning from issues present in the published body of work. As far as we know, this is the largest literature review of its kind and the first to summarize research pitfalls in a research methodology that avoids them. In total, we discovered 20 pitfalls that limit current research impact and reproducibility. The identified pitfalls range from (i) the lack of a proper threat model, that complicates paper’s evaluation, to (ii) the use of closed-source solutions and private datasets, that limit reproducibility. We also report yet-to-be-overcome challenges that are inherent to the malware nature, such as non-deterministic analysis results. Based on our findings, we propose a set of actions to be taken by the malware research and development community for future work: (i) Consolidation of malware research as a field constituted of diverse research approaches (e.g., engineering solutions, offensive research, landscapes/observational studies, and network traffic/system traces analysis); (ii) design of engineering solutions with clearer, direct assumptions (e.g., positioning solutions as proofs-of-concept vs. deployable); (iii) design of experiments that reflects (and emphasizes) the target scenario for the proposed solution (e.g., corporation, user, country-wide); (iv) clearer exposition and discussion of limitations of used technologies and exercised norms/standards for research (e.g., the use of closed-source antiviruses as ground-truth).}

Four types of attacks (direct, sequential, temporal and over-soliciting) that affect an industrial system are studied in this work. Based on the vulnerabilities in ICS and the positioning of other techniques, an innovative methodology is exposed in this paper to develop detection mechanisms based on the “automation-knowledge”. Thus, by using models of system with an improved notion of distance and trajectory, our filters based approach provides good results for detecting cyberattacks in lower levels of ICS architecture by analyzing the malicious nature of the orders sent. Different types of detection mechanisms based on the concept of distance and trajectory are detailed in this study. We also provide results on simulation examples and an industrial platform. To conclude, improvements of our approach are discussed.}

abstract = {Given the relevance of smartphones for accessing personalized services in smart cities, Continuous Authentication (CA) mechanisms are attracting attention to avoid impersonation attacks. Some of them leverage Data Stream Mining (DSM) techniques applied over sensorial information. Injection attacks can undermine the effectiveness of DSM-based CA by fabricating artificial sensorial readings.The goal of this paper is to study the impact of injection attacks in terms of accuracy and immediacy to illustrate the time the adversary remains unnoticed. Two well-known DSM techniques (K-Nearest Neighbours and Hoeffding Adaptive Trees) and three data sources (location, gyroscope and accelerometer) are considered due to their widespread usage Results show that even if the attacker does not previously know anything about the victim, a significant attack surface arises – 1.35 min are needed, in the best case, to detect the attack on gyroscope and accelerometer and 7.27 min on location data. Moreover, we show that the type of sensor at stake and configuration settings may have a dramatic effect on countering this threat.}

First, anomalies among similar types of sensor data are detected based on time correlation. Second, malicious nodes are identified based on spatial correlation. Third, the identified malicious nodes are verified based on event correlation. The experimental results and their comparison with those of existing methods show that the proposed scheme has better recall with lower false-positive and false-negative rates than those of the traditional fuzzy reputation model and weighted-trust-based methods.}

abstract = {DoS and DDoS attacks have been growing in size and number over the last decade and existing solutions to mitigate these attacks are largely inefficient. Compared to other types of malicious cyber attacks, DoS and DDoS attacks are particularly challenging to combat. Because of their ability to mask themselves as legitimate traffic, it has proven difficult to develop methods to detect these types of attacks on a packet or flow level. In this paper, we explore the potential of Variational Autoencoders to serve as a component within an intelligent security solution that differentiates between normal and malicious traffic. The motivation behind resorting to Variational Autoencoders is that unlike normal encoders that would code an input flow as a single point, they encode a flow as a distribution over the latent space which avoids overfitting. Intuitively, this allows a Variational Autoencoder to not only learn latent representations of seen input features, but to generalize in a way that allows for an interpretation of unseen flows and flow features with slight variations. Two methods based on the ability of Variational Autoencoders to learn latent representations from network traffic flows of both benign and malicious traffic, are proposed. The first method resorts to a classifier based on the latent encodings obtained from Variational Autoencoders learned from traffic traces. The second method is an anomaly detection method, where the Variational Autoencoder is used to learn the abstract feature representations of exclusively legitimate traffic. Anomalies are then filtered out by relying on the reconstruction loss of the Variational Autoencoder. In this sense, the construction loss of the autoencoder is fed as input to a classifier that outputs the class of the traffic including benign and malign, and eventually the attack type. Thus, the second approach operates with two separate training processes on two separate data sources: the first training involving only legitimate traffic, and the second training involving all traffic classes. This is different from the first approach which operates only a single training process on the whole traffic dataset. Thus, the autoencoder of the first approach aspires to learn a general feature representation of the flows while the autoencoder of the second approach aims to exclusively learn a representation of the benign traffic. The second approach is thus more susceptible to finding zero day attacks and discovering new attacks as anomalies. Both of the proposed methods have been thoroughly tested on two separate datasets with a similar feature space. The results show that both methods are promising, with the classifier-based method being slightly superior to the anomaly-based one.}

Such an attack usually results in the loss of sensitive and confidential information. Because email communication is an integral part of daily business operations, APT attackers frequently leverage email as an attack vector for initial penetration of the targeted organization. Emails allow the attacker to deliver malicious attachments or links to malicious websites. Attackers usually use social engineering in order to make the recipient open the malicious email, open the attachment, or press a link. Existing defensive solutions within organizations prevent executables from entering organizational networks via emails, therefore, recent APT attacks tend to attach non-executable files (PDF, MS Office etc.) which are widely used in organizations and mistakenly considered less suspicious or malicious. This article surveys existing academic methods for the detection of malicious PDF files. The article outlines an Active Learning framework and highlights the correlation between structural incompatibility of PDF files and their likelihood of maliciousness. Finally, we provide comparisons, insights and conclusions, as well as avenues for future research in order to enhance the detection of malicious PDFs.}

Attack modelling techniques (AMTs) - such as attack graphs, attack trees and fault trees, are a popular method of mathematically and visually representing the sequence of events that lead to a successful cyber-attack. These methods are useful visual aids that can aid cyber-attack perception. This survey paper describes the fundamental theory of cyber-attack before describing how important elements of a cyber-attack are represented in attack graphs and attack trees. The key focus of the paper is to present empirical research aimed at analysing more than 180 attack graphs and attack trees to identify how attack graphs and attack trees present cyber-attacks in terms of their visual syntax. There is little empirical or comparative research which evaluates the effectiveness of these methods. Furthermore, despite their popularity, there is no standardised attack graph visual syntax configuration, and more than seventy self-nominated attack graph and twenty attack tree configurations have been described in the literature — each of which presents attributes such as preconditions and exploits in a different way. The survey demonstrates that there is no standard method of representing attack graphs or attack trees and that more research is needed to standardise the representation.}

Feature engineering plays an important role in addressing these problems. To better represent the underlying problem and improve the performances of classifiers in identifying malicious URLs, this paper proposed a combination of linear and non-linear space transformation methods. For linear transformation, a two-stage distance metric learning approach was developed: first, singular value decomposition was performed to get an orthogonal space, and then a linear programming was used to solve an optimal distance metric. For nonlinear transformation, we introduced Nyström method for kernel approximation and used the revised distance metric for its radial basis function such that the merits of both linear and non-linear transformations can be utilized. 33,1622 URLs with 62 features were collected to validate the proposed feature engineering methods. The results showed that the proposed methods significantly improved the efficiency and performance of certain classifiers, such as k-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, and neural networks. The malicious URLs’ identification rate of k-Nearest Neighbor was increased from 68% to 86%, the rate of linear Support Vector Machine was increased from 58% to 81%, and the rate of Multi-Layer Perceptron was increased from 63% to 82%.

abstract = {Cooperative cyberdefense has been recognized as an essential strategy to fight against cyberattacks. Cybersecurity Information Sharing (CIS), especially about threats and incidents, is a key aspect in this regard. CIS provides members with an improved situational awareness to prepare for and respond to future cyberthreats. Privacy preservation is critical in this context, since organizations can be reluctant to share information otherwise. This is particularly critical when CIS is facilitated through an untrusted infrastructure provided by a third party (e.g., the cloud). Despite this, current data formats and protocols for CIS do not guarantee any form of privacy preservation to participants. In this paper we introduce PRACIS, a scheme for CIS networks that guarantees private data forwarding and aggregation. PRACIS leverages the well-known Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) standard data format. Remarkably, PRACIS can be seamlessly integrated with existing STIX-based message brokering middleware such as publish-subscribe architectures. PRACIS achieves these goals by combining standard format-preserving and homomorphic encryption primitives. We discuss experimental results obtained with a prototype implementation developed for a subset of STIX. Results show that entities may create up to 689 incidents per minute, far beyond the estimated average of 81. Moreover, aggregation of 104 incidents can be carried out in just 2.1 s, and the transmission overhead is just 13.5 kbps. Overall, these results suggest that the costs incurred by PRACIS are easily affordable in real-world scenarios.}

Since Yao’s seminal work in 1982, 30 years of research on SMPC has been conducted, proceeding from pure theoretical research into real-world applications. Recently, the increasing prevalence of the newly emerging technologies such as cloud computing, mobile computing and the Internet of Thing has resulted in a re-birth of SMPC’s popularity. This has occurred mainly because, as a generic tool for computing on private data, SMPC has a natural advantage in solving security and privacy issues in these areas. Accordingly, many application-oriented SMPC protocols have been constructed. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the theoretical and practical aspects of SMPC protocols. Specifically, we start by demonstrating the underlying concepts of SMPC, including its security requirements and basic construction techniques. Then, we present the research advances regarding construction techniques for generic SMPC protocols, and also the cutting-edge approaches to cloud-assisted SMPC protocols. Then, we summarize the concrete application-oriented protocols that are currently available, and finally, we present a discussion of the current literature and conclude this survey.}

However, due to the distributed nature, how to defend such kind of network against insider attacks remains a challenge, especially under multiple-mix-attack model where attackers can launch several attacks simultaneously. In this work, we consider a type of multiple-mix-attack that combines three typical attacks - tamper attack, drop attack and replay attack with an uncertain probability. For detection, we propose an approach called Distributed Consensus based Trust Model (DCONST), which can evaluate the trustworthiness of IoT nodes by sharing certain information called cognition. In particular, DCONST can detect malicious nodes and analyze their concrete attack behaviours via the K-Means clustering method. To further discuss the impact of cognition aggregation on detection accuracy and the additional burden on the network, we design three modes of DCONST: DCONST-Light, DCONST-Normal and DCONST-Proactive. In the evaluation, as compared with the similar methods of Hard Detection (HD) and Perceptron Detection with Enhancement (PDE), it is found that DCONST can achieve a better detection rate in the range from around 10% to 40%. In addition, DCONST-Normal and DCONST-Proactive can further improve the detection rate by 5% to 20% as compared to DCONST-Light.}

This information is invaluable for security experts to keep pace with the increasing rate of development of new network applications and their underlying protocols. FieldHunter relies on collecting application messages from multiple sessions. Then, it performs field extraction and inference of their types by taking into consideration statistical correlations between different messages or other associations with meta-data such as message length, client or server IP addresses. We evaluated FieldHunter on real network traffic collected in ISP networks from three different continents. FieldHunter was able to extract security relevant fields and infer their types for well documented network protocols (such as DNS and MSNP) as well as protocols for which the specifications are not publicly available (such as SopCast). Further, we developed a payload-based anomaly detection system for industrial control systems using FieldHunter.

abstract = {In Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems, the intelligent devices are vulnerable to be attacked by weak Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), thereby threatening the security of the systems. Therefore, it is of great significance to investigate the weak EMI attack of IIoT systems. The different manufacturing processes and deployment environments make the intelligent devices carry different noises, called fingerprints, which are unchanged unless these intelligent devices are attacked. Hence, we can detect weak EMI attacks by judging whether the fingerprint of intelligent device has been changed, which is different from using professional detection equipment as in other methods. Based on the fingerprint of intelligent device, this paper proposes a highly efficient weak EMI attack detection method which is divided into three steps. First, the fingerprint is extracted by Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) model and Kalman algorithm. Second, according to the extracted fingerprint, a fusion model is designed to determine whether the device is attacked by weak EMI. In the fusion model, Feature Extraction Unit (FEU) combines with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to improve the detection accuracy. Finally, an edge computing framework is proposed to enhance the efficiency of the method. The experimental results show that the detection accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed method are 5.2% and 42.2% higher than those of the state-of-the-art method, respectively.}

Consequently, the implementation of detection and defense against them is a concern among the research communities. But it is formidable to deploy extension modules to detect and mitigate attacks online in traditional networks, because devices are deficient of flexibility and scalability. To address the problem, we design and implement an online attack detection and mitigation system (ADMS) framework via the scalable and programmable Software Defined Networking (SDN). ADMS is installed on SDN controllers and conforms to the OpenFlow policy without extra devices. ADMS consists of two modules: the two-phase detection module and the mitigation module. The two-phase detection module combines the new port traffic feature and the Lightgbm classifier based on flow table statistics traffic to precisely detect LDoS attacks. The mitigation module utilizes the novel Sequence Matching based Dynamic Series Analysing (SMDSA) algorithm to locate the attacker, and efficiently mitigates attack traffic by packet filter. The SMDSA algorithm distinguishes the victim port from benign ports by calculating the anomaly score of each port. Our evaluation on a prototype implementation of ADMS shows that the framework is able to precisely identify and efficiently mitigate LDoS attacks in real-time.}

In this paper we study the effect of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) dataset characteristics on privacy preserving solutions previously proposed in the literature. We focus on common characteristics (data granularity, retention time and use of pseudonyms) and we study their effect on two privacy violations: de-anonymization and de-pseudonymization. In order to better understand their effect, we study the capabilities of the adversary through its modeling and description by a probabilistic framework. We perform evaluations on a large dataset collected from a real AMI environment. Our results show that simple changes in the data collection procedure can help mitigate the outcome of these privacy violations.}

abstract = {The defacement of web sites has become a widespread problem. Reaction to these incidents is often quite slow and triggered by occasional checks or even feedback from users, because organizations usually lack a systematic and round the clock surveillance of the integrity of their web sites. A more systematic approach is certainly desirable. An attractive option in this respect consists in augmenting availability and performance monitoring services with defacement detection capabilities. Motivated by these considerations, in this paper we assess the performance of several anomaly detection approaches when faced with the problem of detecting web defacements automatically. All these approaches construct a profile of the monitored page automatically,based on machine learning techniques, and raise an alert when the page content does not fit the profile. We assessed their performance in terms of false positives and false negatives on a dataset composed of 300 highly dynamic web pages that we observed for 3months and includesa set of 320 real defacements.}

In this paper, we propose some of these insecurities that prevail in the cloud computing environment (Trustworthy Space) and the energy sector for smart grids. The insecurities are classified based on the motivation behind them. We rely on the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) tool, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine how these insecurities affect smart grids.

abstract = {Conventional isolated cyber–physical systems (CPS) based industrial networks are increasingly being integrated with modern corporate information technology (IT) network. Therefore, cyber-attacks on CPS are increasing enormously and this could result in a massive damage to the machines themselves or the humans who interact with them. Malware has been one of the major source of attacks and threats to the CPS networks and computer systems. The high growth and the variety of malware variants such as Internet worms, Trojan horses and computer viruses requires periodic update of the database. Traditional malware system fulfil this requirement by manual effort from the experts though signature generation. However manual update could result into potential drawback for integrity and availability of services provided by CPS systems and protection in real-time. Machine learning technique is a natural choice to address the malware challenge for CPSs, since it can easily model and discover the underlying patterns from large-scale data sets. This paper introduces intelligent models and algorithms that can extract behavioural features and inherent attack patterns from the existing malware data, then integrates the behavioural indicators into the detection system. The main contribution of the paper is that the proposed models do not require periodic manual effort to update the database of the detection engine. We have introduced semi-supervised models using unsupervised learning including independent component analysis (ICA), global K-means clustering and multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA) for extracting behavioural indicators which clusters the malware. Then the extracted geometric information of the clusters and hoteling T2 of the behavioural indicators from MEWMA are incorporated into the database of existing detection system which are used with support vector machine (SVM) based supervised system. This enables the detection system to update the dynamic behavioural patterns of new malware automatically. The performances of developed semi-supervised models have been verified using malware data for both static and dynamic characteristics of malware. The summary of our experimental results demonstrate that the combination of unsupervised and supervised learning can successfully extracts behavioural indicators automatically from new malware. Performance comparison from experimental results summarize that the semi-supervised models can detect more accurately than the existing supervised models where accuracies are increased up to 100% for SVM and random forest based semi-supervised models.}

Addressing the security issues in UAV-Edge Computing network is mandatory due to the criticality of UEC services, such as network traffic monitoring, or search and rescue operations. However, cyber defense and protection of UEC network have not yet received sufficient research attention. Thereby, we propose and develop a cyber-defense solution based on a non-cooperative game to protect the UEC from network and offloading attacks, while taking into account nodes’ energy constraints and computation overhead. Simulation results show that, the deployment of our cyber defense system in UEC network requires low energy consumption and low computation overhead to obtain a high protection rate.}

The vulnerabilities are now leveraged by malicious users for the purpose of electricity theft. Many approaches are proposed to identify malicious users. However, some of them have low detection rates; the others suffer from either low inspection speed or huge cost of deploying monitoring devices. In this paper, to accurately locate malicious users stealing electricity in a fast and economic way, we propose three novel inspection algorithms. First, Binary-Coded Grouping-based Inspection (BCGI) algorithm is proposed. Under some assumptions, it can locate malicious users with only one inspection step. Given n users, the BCGI algorithm requires Θ(log2(n)) inspectors. Unfortunately, in some cases we do not have enough inspectors for the BCGI algorithm to work. To deal with these cases, we further propose two algorithms: M-ary Coded Grouping-based Inspection (MCGI) and Generalized BCGI (G-BCGI). In the MCGI algorithm, users’ identification (ID) numbers are encoded into (l+1)-nary notations, where l is adaptively determined by the number of users and the number of available inspectors. It can locate malicious users within l inspection steps. In G-BCGI algorithm, users’ IDs are encoded into binary notations, similar to the BCGI algorithm, and multiple rounds may be needed to locate malicious users. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithms can locate malicious users accurately and efficiently.}

In this work, we propose a probabilistic goal recognition approach tailored to a dynamic shortest-path network interdiction problem. Apart from inferring a probabilistic distribution over the possible goals of an agent, our work has another four key novelties: (i) a dynamic shortest-path local network interdiction model that allocates resources locally per step using goal recognition information; (ii) two behavior modeling approaches, including a data-driven learning method based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning as well as a heuristic method taking advantage of the network information, to help solve both the data-intensive and no available data situations; (iii) a heuristic named Subjective Confidence that uses variance in particle system for flexible resource allocation adjustment. The empirical test results show the effectiveness of our goal recognition method, and also verify the practical implications of these methods in solving scalable multi-terminus network interdiction problem.}

In this paper, we propose BotGrab, a general botnet detection system that considers both malicious activities and the history of coordinated group activities in the network to identify bot-infected hosts. BotGrab tracks suspected hosts participating in some coordinated group activities and calculates a negative reputation score for each of them based on the history of their participation in these activities. A suspected host will be identified as being bot-infected if it has a high negative reputation score or performs some malicious activities while having a low negative reputation score. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BotGrab to detect various botnets including HTTP-, IRC-, and P2P-based botnets using a testbed network consisting of some bot-infected hosts.}

These benefits are fueled by innovations in orchestration of cloud platforms that make them programmable as Software Defined everything Infrastructures (SDxI). At the same time, sophisticated targeted attacks such as Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are growing on an unprecedented scale threatening the availability of online businesses. In this paper, we present a novel defense system called Dolus to mitigate the impact of targeted attacks launched against high-value services hosted in SDxI-based cloud platforms. Our Dolus system is able to initiate a ‘pretense’ in a scalable and collaborative manner to deter the attacker based on threat intelligence obtained from attack feature analysis. Using foundations from pretense theory in child play, Dolus takes advantage of elastic capacity provisioning via ‘quarantine virtual machines’ and SDxI policy co-ordination across multiple network domains to deceive the attacker by creating a false sense of success. We evaluate the efficacy of Dolus using a GENI Cloud testbed and demonstrate its real-time capabilities to: (a) detect DDoS and APT attacks and redirect attack traffic to quarantine resources to engage the attacker under pretense, (b) coordinate SDxI policies to possibly block attacks closer to the attack source(s).}

Components such as sensors, radio transceivers, and touchscreen controllers are generally supplied to the manufacturers, along with driver software that facilitates communication between the component and the host device. Driver software is normally embedded within the operating system kernel, where it is trusted to behave within defined parameters. Since the hardware of the smart device is expected not to change frequently, the device driver source code implicitly assumes that the hardware of the component is authentic and trustworthy. Such trust permits driver designs with a lax approach towards the integrity and security of data exchanged between the main processor and the hardware component. In this paper, we question this trust in hardware components. Smart devices such as phones are often repaired with replacement components. Identifying and authenticating the source of these components is usually very difficult. We assume the threat consists of a malicious replacement touchscreen procured from an untrusted vendor. We construct two standalone attacks based on malicious touchscreen hardware. Our experiments demonstrate that these attacks allow an adversary to impersonate and eavesdrop on a user, exfiltrate data, and exploit the operating system, enabling the execution of privileged commands. For mitigating these and other similar attacks, we build and evaluate a machine-learning, hardware-based countermeasure capable of detecting abnormal communications with hardware components.}

Fog computing, as a promising computing paradigm, facilitates computing, storing and network services between terminal devices and cloud computing data centers. It also brings many advantages to cloud computing and large-scale deployment of IoT applications such as low latency, data locality, location-awareness, mobility, less computational cost and geographical distribution. This extensive range of functionality raises various security concerns related to data, virtualization, segregation, network communication and monitoring. Security is a significant issue for fog computing since fog-based services are offered to massive-scale end-users by front fog nodes/servers. Also, fog computing focuses on ensuring the availability and reliability of services without worrying about the information stored or processed by the fog. Despite significant efforts that have been made in this field, many issues are still open. This paper prepares a comprehensive study of security challenges and different approaches in fog computing to address those challenges using the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach. Moreover, a technical taxonomy is offered for the fog security challenges and their strategies in terms of six aspects, including reliability, access control, attacks, secure connection, privacy and some special cases. The core objective of this study is to analytically and statistically classify the existing research techniques related to security aspects and available solutions in fog computing published between 2014 and 2021. Then some technical questions in this domain are provided, and also the strengths and weaknesses of each indicated fog security approach are discussed based on the questions, as well as suggesting some ideas to address security deficiencies in fog computing. Finally, some future motivational directions and open issues in this field are provided to design, implement, and maintain fog systems.}

This higher level of coordination is possible mainly due to botnets, which are clusters of infected hosts controlled remotely by an attacker (botmaster). The number of infected machines is continuously rising, thereby resulting in botnets with over a million infected machines. This powerful capability gives the botmaster a lethal weapon to launch various security attacks. As a result, botnet detection techniques received greater research focus. The Domain Name System (DNS) is a large scale distributed database on the Internet, which is being abused as a botnet communication channel. While there are numerous survey and review papers on botnet detection, there are two survey papers on DNS-based botnet detection which are neither comprehensive nor take into consideration various parameters vital for effective comparison.

abstract = {Wireless body area network (WBAN), got the IEEE standard in February 2012, is the most significant and highly focused research area among researchers, academicians, and practitioners; applied to the patient's body for monitoring various physiological parameters and then the sensitive measured data is passed to the concerned medical doctor or server for taking the necessary actions. In order to pass the sensitive data securely, authentication is the first step towards it. The authentication schemes help network to reduce unwanted users and prevent from deceptions effectively since the authentication process identifies the user's identity that he or she claims to be. In connection to the safe communication, authentication is one of the key aspects. So, it is important to design novel authentication schemes; those offer secure authentication and prevent various security attacks in WBANs. A lot of methods and techniques have been proposed for authentication in WBANs. In this survey paper for improving the authentication process in WBANs, an overview of WBAN and their characteristics, various authentication types and classification of authentication schemes has been done. It further provides a complete comparison of different authentication schemes and highlights their pros, cons, limitations, challenges, performance evaluation and their robustness against different security attacks which open doors of new opportunities. This finally ends with the most significant open issues, future research directions and draw interesting conclusions.}

This attack prevents legitimate users from using their desired service. The SYN flooding attack exploits the normal TCP three-way handshake by sending stream of SYN packets to the server with spoofed IP addresses. The detection of this attack is hard since the internet routing infrastructure cannot differentiate between legitimate and spoofed SYN packets. In this paper we present a new detection method for the SYN flooding attack based on Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) in addition to an adaptive threshold, thus we can detect the abnormal behavior in the TCP protocol time series.}

abstract = {Recently, there are growing interests in cognitive radio vehicular ad hoc networks (CR-VANETs), which is a kind of intelligent cyber-physical systems. In CR-VANETs, there are two main processes: spectrum sensing and data transmission. Although some excellent works have been done to address spectrum sensing security and data transmission security in CR-MANETs, these two important areas have traditionally been addressed separately in the literature. In this paper, we propose to use a common framework to study trust management so as to enhance security for both spectrum sensing and data transmission processes in CR-VANETs. We identify a new attack, named joint spectrum sensing and data transmission (JSSDT) attack, in which an attacker can report fake sensing data in the spectrum sensing process as well as drop packets in the data transmission process. Then, using recent advances in the theory of uncertain reasoning, we propose a unified trust management scheme for both spectrum sensing and data transmission processes in CR-VANETs. In addition, based on the unified trust model, we present a weighted consensus-based spectrum sensing scheme to protect the spectrum sensing process. Moreover, we apply the trust value derived from the unified trust model to enhance the security of the data transmission process in CR-VANETs. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed trust-based security schemes.}

abstract = {Android has become the most popular mobile platform due to its openness and flexibility. Meanwhile, it has also become the main target of massive mobile malware. This phenomenon drives a pressing need for malware detection. In this paper, we propose a lightweight framework for Android malware identification. Network traffic generated by mobile app is mirrored from the wireless access point to the server for data analysis. All data analysis and malware detection are performed on the server side, which consumes minimum resources on mobile devices with minimum impacts to user experience. Due to the difficulty in identifying disparate malicious behaviors of malware from the network traffic, our method performs a multi-level network traffic analysis, gathering as many features of network traffic as necessary. The proposed method combines network traffic analysis with machine learning algorithm (C4.5) that is capable of identifying Android malware with high accuracy. In an evaluation with 8,312 benign apps and 5,560 malware samples, our method performs better than other state-of-the-art approaches, and especially when combining two detection mechanisms, it achieves a detection rate of 97.89%. In addition, for the benefit of user, this framework not only displays the final detection results, but also analyzes the behind-the-curtain reason of malicious results. The result explanation also reveals insightful behavioral characteristics of mobile malware.}

Consequently, ubiquitous internal and external communication (controls, commands, and data) within all CAV-related nodes is inevitably the gatekeeper for the smooth operation. Therefore, it is a primary vulnerable area for cyber-attacks that entails stringent and efficient measures in the form of "cybersecurity". There is a lack of systematic and comprehensive review of the literature on cyber-attacks on the CAVs, respective mitigation strategies, anticipated readiness, and research directions for the future. This study aims to analyse, synthesise, and interpret critical areas for the roll-out and progression of CAVs in combating cyber-attacks. Specifically, we described in a structured way a holistic view of potentially critical avenues, which lies at the heart of CAV cybersecurity research. We synthesise their scope with a particular focus on ensuring effective CAVs deployment and reducing the probability of cyber-attack failures. We present the CAVs communication framework in an integrated form, i.e., from In-Vehicle (IV) communication to Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2X) communication with a visual flowchart to provide a transparent picture of all the interfaces for potential cyber-attacks. The vulnerability of CAVs by proximity (or physical) access to cyber-attacks is outlined with future recommendations. There is a detailed description of why the orthodox cybersecurity approaches in Cyber-Physical System (CPS) are not adequate to counter cyber-attacks on the CAVs. Further, we synthesised a table with consolidated details of the cyber-attacks on the CAVs, the respective CAV communication system, its impact, and the corresponding mitigation strategies. It is believed that the literature discussed, and the findings reached in this paper are of great value to CAV researchers, technology developers, and decision-makers in shaping and developing a robust CAV-cybersecurity framework.}

It is possible for a web site to be visited by a regular user as a normal (natural) visit, to be viewed by crawlers, bots, spiders, etc. for indexing purposes, lastly to be exploratory scanned by malicious users prior to an attack. An attack targeted web scan can be viewed as a phase of a potential attack and can lead to more attack detection as compared to traditional detection methods. In this work, we propose a method to detect attack-oriented scans and to distinguish them from other types of visits. In this context, we use access log files of Apache (or ISS) web servers and try to determine attack situations through examination of the past data. In addition to web scan detections, we insert a rule set to detect SQL Injection and XSS attacks. Our approach has been applied on sample data sets and results have been analyzed in terms of performance measures to compare our method and other commonly used detection techniques. Furthermore, various tests have been made on log samples from real systems. Lastly, several suggestions about further development have been also discussed.}

We introduce several algorithms to encapsulate and manage the traditional detection technologies and provide agent-based performance introspection as a mechanism to identify poorly performing systems.

To be specific, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is determined as the most vulnerable threat in the cloud space as it lowers the ability of the predominant resources’ for preventing their optimal utilization. The advent of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is estimated to wide open the feasibility in preventing DDoS attacks in the cloud space. In this paper, a Rival-Model Penalized Self-Organizing Map (RMP-SOM) enforced DDoS Attack Prevention Mechanism is proposed for the remarkable prevention of DDoS attack by utilizing the potential characteristics of SDN that focuses on the possibility of facilitating network global perspective, effective investigation of network traffic, and an enhanced process of rule updating. This proposed RMPSOM-SDNDM scheme utilizes the benefits of the constant rate in order to ensure priority to the closest neuron and its neighborhood rather than its farthest rival neuron for facilitating better detection accuracy. The simulation results of the proposed RMPSOM approach confirmed a phenomenal sensitivity, specificity and accuracy rate during the process of detecting DDoS attacks in the cloud space on par with the baseline DDoS mitigation schemes considered from the literature.}

This article describes five attack scenarios on picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) and medical imaging networks: the import of patient data from storage media containing malware, a compromise of the hospital network, malware embedded in digital imaging and communications in medicine images or reports, a malicious manipulation of medical images and a network infiltration of malicious health level seven messages. Prevention and mitigation measures for each of these attacks exist, some of which can be implemented by the system user (e.g., hospital), while others require implementation in the PACS and medical imaging devices by the vendors. In practice, however, many of these are not in common use. What is missing today are PACS network security guidelines for practitioners that support users in keeping their network secure. Furthermore, integrating the healthcare enterprise integration profiles and test tools might be needed to address the deployment of public key infrastructure and digital signatures in the PACS environment.}

These networks allow people to share different information ranging from news, photos, videos, feelings, personal information or research activities. The rapid growth of OSNs has triggered a dramatic rise in malicious activities including spamming, fake accounts creation, phishing, and malware distribution. However, developing an efficient detection system that can identify malicious accounts, as well as their suspicious behaviors on the social networks, has been quite challenging. Researchers have proposed a number of features and methods to detect malicious accounts. This paper presents a comprehensive review of related studies that deal with detection of malicious accounts on social networking sites. The review focuses on four main categories, which include detection of spam accounts, fake accounts, compromised accounts, and phishing. To group the studies, the taxonomy of the different features and methods used in the literature to identify malicious accounts and their behaviors are proposed. The review considered only social networking sites and excluded studies such as email spam detection. The significance of proposed features and methods, as well as their limitations, are analyzed. Key issues and challenges that require substantial research efforts are discussed. In conclusion, the paper identifies the important future research areas with the aim of advancing the development of scalable malicious accounts detection system in OSNs.}

In this paper, we propose a state-based stochastic model for obtaining quantitative security metrics representing the level of a system’s security. The main focus of the study is on how to model the progression of an attack process over time. The basic assumption of our model is that the time parameter plays the essential role in capturing the nature of an attack process. In practice, the attack process will terminate successfully, possibly after a number of unsuccessful attempts. What is important is, indeed, the estimation of how long it takes to be conducted. The proposed stochastic model is parameterized based on a suitable definition of time distributions describing attacker’s actions and system’s reactions over time. For this purpose, probability distribution functions are defined and assigned to transitions of the model for characterizing the temporal aspects of the attacker and system behavior. With the definition of the distributions, the stochastic model will be recognized to be a semi-Markov chain. This mathematical model will be analytically solved to calculate the desirable quantitative security metrics, such as mean time to security failure and steady-state security. The proposed method shows a systematic development of the stochastic modeling techniques and concepts, used frequently in the area of dependability evaluation, for attack process modeling. Like any other modeling method, the proposed model is also constructed based on some underlying assumptions, which are specific to the context of security analysis.}

The botmasters controlling these networks aim to prevent takedown attempts by using highly resilient P2P overlays to commandeer their botnets, and even harden them with countermeasures against intelligence gathering attempts. In fact, recent research indicates that advanced countermeasures can hamper the ability to gather the necessary intelligence for taking down botnets. In this article, we take the perspective of the botmaster to eventually anticipate their behavior. That said, we present a novel mechanism, namely Trust Based Botnet Monitoring Countermeasure (TrustBotMC), that combines computational trust with specially crafted bot messages to detect the presence of monitoring activity. We study and evaluate different computational trust models, to create a local and autonomous mechanism that ensures the avoidance of common botnet tracking mechanisms, such as sensors. Furthermore, we show, via our experimental results, that our approach can reduce the gathered intelligence by at least 53% compared to techniques that have been seen in botnets to date. Finally, we investigate techniques for mitigating our approach.}

In this paper, we present a new scalable system for network-level behavioral clustering of HTTP-based malware that aims to efficiently group newly collected malware samples into malware family clusters. The end goal is to obtain malware clusters that can aid the automatic generation of high quality network signatures, which can in turn be used to detect botnet command-and-control (C&C) and other malware-generated communications at the network perimeter. We achieve scalability in our clustering system by simplifying the multi-step clustering process proposed in [31], and by leveraging incremental clustering algorithms that run efficiently on very large datasets. At the same time, we show that scalability is achieved while retaining a good trade-off between detection rate and false positives for the signatures derived from the obtained malware clusters. We implemented a proof-of-concept version of our new scalable malware clustering system and performed experiments with about 65,000 distinct malware samples. Results from our evaluation confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system and show that, compared to [31], our approach can reduce processing times from several hours to a few minutes, and scales well to large datasets containing tens of thousands of distinct malware samples.}

abstract = {Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) play an important role in today’s industry by providing process automation, distributed control, and process monitoring. ICS was designed to be used in an isolated area or connected to other systems via specialised communication mechanisms or protocols. This setup allows manufacturers to manage their production processes with great flexibility and safety. However, this design does not meet today’s business requirements to work with state-of-the-art technologies such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) and big data analytics. In order to fulfil industry requirements, many ICSs have been connected to enterprise networks that allow business users to access real-time data generated by power plants. At the same time, this new design opens up several cybersecurity challenges for ICSs. We review possible cyber attacks on ICSs, identify typical threats and vulnerabilities, and we discuss unresolved security issues with existing ICS cybersecurity solutions.

Co-inhabitant DOS assaults would deplete out the cloud assets which impairs the certifiable cloud clients from executing cloud utilization. Consequently aversion and conclusion of the event related to co-inhabitant assaults results in fundamental assignment of cloud form. In our past research strategy, Two-Player Game Approach (TPGA) is acquainted which points that show evasion of co-inhabitant DOS assaults by learning and arranging the Virtual Machine requested from clients on account of the low, medium and high hazard demands. Anyway this strategy decreased in its execution regarding discovery of hazard dimension of client ask for VMs. There is no predefined method for recognizing hazard estimation of VM assets. And furthermore it would be troublesome keep up and refresh the hazard status data of the cloud assets. This is settled in the proposed research strategy by presenting the system called State Transition Model based defense mechanism (STM) or State Observation based Co-Resident DOS Attack Detection (SO-CRDOS-AD). In the proposed research technique at first hazard estimation of each asset dependent on client demands is assessed by utilizing hazard recognition metric. In light of this hazard metric esteem, state estimation of each client ask for as far as VM is refreshed. The states that are considered in this work are Security State, Vulnerability State, Attacked State, Positive State, Negative State, Degenerate State and Failure State. These state estimations of VM assets are refreshed occasionally with the assistance of Markov Chain display. This examination technique is actualized in the CloudSim condition from which it is demonstrated that the proposed research strategy can guarantee the exact recognition of assault status of VM asks for, therefore the security level can be upgraded.}

The asymptotic analysis suggests that when the training sets are sufficiently large these methods outperform the conventional methods handling missing data that do not consider strategic motivations of agents (e.g., Average method and Similarity method). Scale-up experiments support the theoretical findings and show that as the training size increases the misclassification rates of those methods decrease. We show that sampling can be used to efficiently identify sufficient information for the imputation methods to treat strategically missing data.}

IoT-based smart grid systems are critical infrastructures, also they have complex architectures and include critical devices. They contain communication systems that can lead to national security deficits, disruption of public order, loss of life or large-scale economic damage when the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the communication is broken down. These huge systems may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Therefore, there is a lot of research effort to enhance smart grid security in industry, government, and academia. The security approaches are important to improve solutions against cyber-attacks in smart grid applications. We present a comprehensive survey supported by a wide review of earlier work. Additionally, recent advances and countermeasures are presented on smart grid cyber-security. In this paper, the threats and potential solutions of the IoT-based smart grid are analyzed. We focus on cyber-attack types and provide an in-depth of the cyber-security state of the smart grid.

In this context, hiding the location of an ADS-B receiver could be useful for several reasons, including military and privacy aspects. Therefore, taking into account these considerations, the data provided by a few antennas in one of the most popular crowdsourcing platforms, Opensky Network, are released removing any information that could lead to their direct location identification. In this manuscript, we investigate the effectiveness of protecting location privacy in avionic crowdsourced networks. As a worst-case scenario, we demonstrate that, when a feasible number of receivers are deployed in the same area of a protected one, due to the nature of involved ADS-B data, standard time-based localization schemes can identify the location of any protected receiver. Our model, applied to real data, can identify the location of a protected receiver with an error ranging from 0.9 km to 2.6 km, depending on the target sensor—while the location uncertainty induced by the anonymization technique was expected to be of approximately 450 km. Our findings, supported by an extensive experimental campaign run over real data, apply to a variety of potentially protected receivers. Moreover, we also provide effective countermeasures to increase receivers’ location privacy. Finally, we discuss the trade-offs implied by the cited countermeasures, showing that it is possible to increase location privacy while not decreasing data utility.}

abstract = {Context
One of the main targets of cyber-attacks is data exfiltration, which is the leakage of sensitive or private data to an unauthorized entity. Data exfiltration can be perpetrated by an outsider or an insider of an organization. Given the increasing number of data exfiltration incidents, a large number of data exfiltration countermeasures have been developed. These countermeasures aim to detect, prevent, or investigate exfiltration of sensitive or private data. With the growing interest in data exfiltration, it is important to review data exfiltration attack vectors and countermeasures to support future research in this field.
Objective
This paper is aimed at identifying and critically analysing data exfiltration attack vectors and countermeasures for reporting the status of the art and determining gaps for future research.
Method
We have followed a structured process for selecting 108 papers from seven publication databases. Thematic analysis method has been applied to analyse the extracted data from the reviewed papers.
Results
We have developed a classification of (1) data exfiltration attack vectors used by external attackers and (2) the countermeasures in the face of external attacks. We have mapped the countermeasures to attack vectors. Furthermore, we have explored the applicability of various countermeasures for different states of data (i.e., in use, in transit, or at rest).
Conclusion
This review has revealed that (a) most of the state of the art is focussed on preventive and detective countermeasures and significant research is required on developing investigative countermeasures that are equally important; (b) Several data exfiltration countermeasures are not able to respond in real-time, which specifies that research efforts need to be invested to enable them to respond in real-time (c) A number of data exfiltration countermeasures do not take privacy and ethical concerns into consideration, which may become an obstacle in their full adoption (d) Existing research is primarily focussed on protecting data in ‘in use’ state, therefore, future research needs to be directed towards securing data in ‘in rest’ and ‘in transit’ states (e) There is no standard or framework for evaluation of data exfiltration countermeasures. We assert the need for developing such an evaluation framework.}

However, the classification process is often impaired by the lack of granular network traffic ground truth. Granular network traffic ground truth is critical to provide a benchmark for a fair evaluation of modern network traffic classification. Nevertheless, in modern network traffic classification, existing ground truth tools only managed to build the ground truth at the application name level at most. Application name level granularity is quickly becoming insufficient to address the current needs of network traffic classification and therefore; this paper presents the design, development and experimental evaluation of Grano-GT, a tool to build a reliable and highly granular network traffic ground truth for encrypted browser-based traffic at the application name and service levels. Grano-GT builds on four main engines which are packet capture, browser, application and service isolator engines. These engines work together to intercept the application requests and combine them with the support of temporal features and cascading filters to produce reliable and highly granular ground truth. Preliminary experimental results show that Grano-GT can classify the Internet traffic into respective application names with high reliability. Grano-GT achieved an average accuracy of more than 95% when validated using nDPI at the application name level. The remaining 5% loss of accuracy was primarily due to the unavailability of signatures in nDPI. In addition, Grano-GT managed to classify application service traffic with significant reliability and validated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.}

However, conducting cyber-security exercises with new and unique scenarios requires comprehensive planning and commitment to the preparation time and resources. In this work, we propose a serious game for the development of cyber-security exercise scenarios. The game provides a platform to model simulated cyber-security exercise scenarios, transforming them into an emulated cyber-security exercise environment using domain-specific language (DSL) and infrastructure orchestration. In this game, players can play as cyber attackers or defenders in a multiplayer environment to make operational cyber-security decisions in real-time.

abstract = {The IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) was standardised by the IETF ROLL Working Group to address the routing issues in the Internet of Things (IoT) Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). RPL builds and maintains a Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) topology using pieces of information propagated within the DODAG Information Object (DIO) control message. When a node intends to join the DODAG, it either waits for DIO or sends a DODAG Information Solicitation (DIS) control message Multicast to solicit DIOs from nearby nodes. Nevertheless, sending Multicast DIS messages resets the timer that regulates the transmission rate of DIOs to its minimum value, which leads to the network’s congestion with control messages. Because of the resource-constrained nature of RPL-LLNs, the lack of tamper resistance, and the security gaps of RPL, malicious nodes can exploit the Multicast DIS solicitation mechanism to trigger an RPL-specification-based attack, named DIS attack. The DIS attack can have severe consequences on RPL networks, especially on control packets overhead and power consumption. In this paper, we use the Cooja–Contiki simulator to assess the DIS attack’s effects on both static and dynamic PRL networks. Besides, we propose and implement a novel approach, namely RPL-MRC, to improve the RPL’s resilience against DIS Multicast. RPL-MRC aims to reduce the response to DIS Multicast messages. Simulation results demonstrate how the attack could damage the network performance by significantly increasing the control packets overhead and power consumption. On the other hand, the RPL-MRC proposed mechanism shows a significant enhancement in reducing the control overhead and power consumption for different scenarios.}

However, the lack of sufficient data in the early phases of the attack adversely affects the ability of feature selection techniques in these models to perceive the common characteristics of the attack features, which makes it challenging to reduce the redundant features, consequently decreasing the detection accuracy. Therefore, this study proposes a novel Redundancy Coefficient Gradual Upweighting (RCGU) technique that makes better redundancy–relevancy trade-offs during feature selection. Unlike existing feature significance estimation techniques that rely on the comparison between the candidate feature and the common characteristics of the already-selected features, RCGU compares the mutual information between the candidate feature and each feature in the selected set individually. Therefore, RCGU increases the weight of the redundancy term proportional to the number of already selected features. By integrating the RCGU into the Mutual Information Feature Selection (MIFS) technique, the Enhanced MIFS (EMIFS) was developed. Further improvement was achieved by proposing MM-EMIFS which incorporates the MaxMin approximation with EMIFS to prevent the redundancy overestimation that RCGU could cause when the number of features in the already-selected set increases. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed techniques achieved accuracy higher than that in related works, which confirms the ability of RCGU to make better redundancy–relevancy trade-offs and select more discriminative pre-encryption attack features compared to existing solutions.}

Existing solutions, consisting of the widely-used antivirus (AV) software, fail to detect newly created and unknown-malware; moreover, by the time the AV is updated, the organization has already been attacked. In this paper, we present a during run-time analysis methodology for a trusted detection of unknown malware on virtual machines (VMs). We conducted trusted analysis of volatile memory dumps taken from a VM and focused on analyzing their system-calls using a sequential-mining-method. We leveraged the most informative system-calls by machine-learning algorithms for the efficient detection of malware in widely used VMs within organizations (i.e. IIS and Email server). We evaluated our methodology in a comprehensive set of experiments over a collections of real-world, advanced, and notorious malware (both ransomware and RAT), and legitimate programs. The results show that our suggested methodology is able to detect the presence of unknown malware, in an average of 97.9% TPR and 0% FPR. Such results and capabilities can form the ground for the development of practical detection-tools for both corporates and companies.}

We claim that Benford's law holds for the inter-arrival times of TCP flows in case of normal traffic. Consequently, any type of anomalies affecting TCP flows, including intentional intrusions or unintended faults and network failures in general, can be detected by investigating the first-digit distributions of the inter-arrival times of TCP SYN packets. In this paper we apply our findings to the detection of intentional attacks, and leave other types of anomalies for future works. We support our claim with related researches that indicate the TCP flow inter-arrival times can be modeled by Weibull distribution with shape parameter less than 1, and show the relation between Weibull distributed data and Benford's law. Finally, we validate our findings on real traffic and achieve encouraging results.}

However, they rely heavily on the assumption that different nodes in the same routing path have equal reputation, which may be not invalid in practice and cause inaccurate detection results. To solve this issue, we formulate it as a multivariate multiple linear regression problem and use the K-means classification algorithm to detect malicious nodes. Further, we optimize the routing path and design an enhanced detection scheme. Our results indicate that our proposed methods could achieve a detection accuracy rate of 90% or above in a common case, and the enhanced scheme could reach an even lower false detection rate, i.e., below 5%.}

The VNFs, such as virtual routers, firewalls etc., that typically control and transmit critical network packages, require strong security guarantees. However, detecting malicious or malfunctioning VNFs are challenging, as the behaviors of VNFs are dynamic and complex due to the changing network traffics in the cloud. In this paper, we propose a smart and efficient Hidden Markov Model based anomaly detection system (named vGuard) to protect online VNF services in the cloud. A general multivariate HMM model is proposed to profile the normal VNF behavior patterns. Using the VNF behavior model trained with normal observation sequences, vGuard can effectively detect abnormal behaviors online. vGuard is a general framework that can train different types of VNF behavior models. We implement the vGuard prototype in the OpenStack platform. Two types of VNF models, virtual router and virtual firewall, are trained using real normal network traffics in our experiment evaluation. A collection of abnormal attack cases are tested on the VNFs that showed the effectiveness of vGuard in detecting VNF behavior anomalies.}

abstract = {Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is expected to be a key feature supported by 5G networks, especially due to the proliferation of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), which has a prominent role in reducing network stress by shifting computational tasks from the Internet to the mobile edge. Apart from being part of MEC, D2D can extend cellular coverage allowing users to communicate directly when telecommunication infrastructure is highly congested or absent. This significant departure from the typical cellular paradigm imposes the need for decentralised network routing protocols. Moreover, enhanced capabilities of mobile devices and D2D networking will likely result in proliferation of new malware types and epidemics. Although the literature is rich in terms of D2D routing protocols that enhance quality-of-service and energy consumption, they provide only basic security support, e.g., in the form of encryption. Routing decisions can, however, contribute to collaborative detection of mobile malware by leveraging different kinds of anti-malware software installed on mobile devices. Benefiting from the cooperative nature of D2D communications, devices can rely on each others’ contributions to detect malware. The impact of our work is geared towards having more malware-free D2D networks. To achieve this, we designed and implemented a novel routing protocol for D2D communications that optimises routing decisions for explicitly improving malware detection. The protocol identifies optimal network paths, in terms of malware mitigation and energy spent for malware detection, based on a game theoretic model. Diverse capabilities of network devices running different types of anti-malware software and their potential for inspecting messages relayed towards an intended destination device are leveraged using game theoretic tools. An optimality analysis of both Nash and Stackelberg security games is undertaken, including both zero and non-zero sum variants, and the Defender’s equilibrium strategies. By undertaking network simulations, theoretical results obtained are illustrated through randomly generated network scenarios showing how our protocol outperforms conventional routing protocols, in terms of expected payoff, which consists of: security damage inflicted by malware and malware detection cost.}

Meanwhile, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is gaining popularity in enterprise networks for flexibility in network management service and reduced operational cost. There seems a trend for the two technologies to go hand-in-hand in providing an enterprise’s IT services. However, the new challenges brought by the marriage of cloud computing and SDN, particularly the implications on enterprise network security, have not been well understood. This paper sets to address this important problem. We start by examining the security impact, in particular, the impact on DDoS attack defense mechanisms, in an enterprise network where both technologies are adopted. We find that SDN technology can actually help enterprises to defend against DDoS attacks if the defense architecture is designed properly. To that end, we propose a DDoS attack mitigation architecture that integrates a highly programmable network monitoring to enable attack detection and a flexible control structure to allow fast and specific attack reaction. To cope with the new architecture, we propose a graphic model based attack detection system that can deal with the dataset shift problem. The simulation results show that our architecture can effectively and efficiently address the security challenges brought by the new network paradigm and our attack detection system can effectively report various attacks using real-world network traffic.}

Evidently, the inherent distortion of data results in the degradation of its utility. This work proposes and analyzes an anonymization method that draws upon the technique of linear discriminant analysis (LDA), with the aim of preserving the empirical utility of data. Further, this utility is measured as the accuracy of a machine learning model trained on the microaggregated data. By transforming the original data records to a different data space, LDA enables k-anonymous microaggregation to build microcells more tailored to an intrinsic classification threshold. To do this, first, data is rotated (projected) towards the direction of maximum discrimination and, second, scaled in this direction by a factor α that penalizes distortion across the classification threshold. The upshot is that thinner cells are built along the threshold, which ends up preserving data utility in terms of the accuracy of machine learned models for a number of standardized data sets.}

Consequently, there is growing interest in identifying contextual information from sensor data to facilitate the performance of various tasks, e.g., traffic management, cyber attack detection, and healthcare monitoring. The correct identification of contexts in data streams is helpful for many tasks, for example, it can assist in providing high-quality recommendations to end users and in reporting anomalous behavior based on the detection of unusual contexts. This paper presents DeepStream, a novel data stream temporal clustering algorithm that dynamically detects sequential and overlapping clusters. DeepStream is tuned to classify contextual information in real time and is capable of coping with a high-dimensional feature space. DeepStream utilizes stacked autoencoders to reduce the dimensionality of unbounded data streams and for cluster representation. This method detects contextual behavior and captures nonlinear relations of the input data, giving it an advantage over existing methods that rely on PCA. We evaluated DeepStream empirically using four sensor and IoT datasets and compared it to five state-of-the-art stream clustering algorithms. Our evaluation shows that DeepStream outperforms all of these algorithms. Our evaluation also demonstrates how DeepStream’s improved clustering performance results in improved detection of anomalous data.}

Due to rapid scalability and high heterogeneity, traditional security approaches fails to provide adequate security mechanisms for the current IoT infrastructure. The possibility of insecure and unattended deployment make some of IoT's entities subject to be captured physically by the attackers. As a result, the victim device can be exploited as a gateway to compromise the entire network. Furthermore, an entity may not work correctly because of resources constraints or instability of network's link.

This is exacerbated by the commoditization of the malware development industry, in which tools can be readily obtained in specialized hacking forums or underground markets. However, despite the great interest in targeting this infrastructure, there is little understanding of what the main features of this type of malware are, or the motives of the criminals behind it, apart from the classic denial of service attacks. This is vital to modern malware forensics, where analyses are required to measure the trustworthiness of files collected at large during an investigation, but also to confront challenges posed by tech-savvy criminals (e.g., Trojan Horse Defense). In this paper, we present a comprehensive characterization of Linux-based malware. Our study is tailored to IoT malware and it leverages automated techniques using both static and dynamic analysis to classify malware into related threats. By looking at the most representative dataset of Linux-based malware collected by the community to date, we are able to show that our system can accurately characterize known threats. As a key novelty, we use our system to investigate a number of threats unknown to the community. We do this in two steps. First, we identify known patterns within an unlabeled dataset using a classifier trained with the labeled dataset. Second, we combine our features with a custom distance function to discover new threats by clustering together similar samples. We further study each of the unknown clusters by using state-of-the-art reverse engineering and forensic techniques and our expertise as malware analysts. We provide an in-depth analysis of what the most recent unknown trends are through a number of case studies. Among other findings, we observe that: i) crypto-mining malware is permeating the IoT infrastructure, ii) the level of sophistication is increasing, and iii) there is a rapid proliferation of new variants with minimal investment in infrastructure.}

The existing static and dynamic form of malware detection is an inefficient technique as it involve in disassembling of malicious code. In this project, the visualization of malware in the form of images is proposed in order to find the malicious insertion on the executable files of computing devices for extreme surveillance. The malware detection becomes easier to visualize the malicious behavior in form of images by feature based classification of images as the global property of exe gray scale image is unchanged. This will be an eye open in healing the security issues in cyber-crime and provide extreme surveillance.}

abstract = {The constant energy requirement was a crucial concern in today’s smart grid era, which needs tremendous attention. New wireless networking technologies should be integrated into the grid to achieve more distributed generation and energy storage. Advancements in wireless sensor networks (WSN) and embedded systems have enabled the implementation of smart grid monitoring and automation systems at low cost. The incorporation of fifth-generation networks (5G) in a smart grid would create novel business models of "edge" and "fog" technology at the utility side, accompanying with smart-control and automation. Nonetheless, WSN’s increased implementation also introduces impediments to safety, particularly relevant to confidentiality, accessibility, and safety management, creating both utilities and customers’ unpredictable expenditure and catastrophe. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of the communication and computing aspects of 5G network infrastructure is provided and discussed how they can be beneficial in promoting advanced smart grid systems in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Besides, this paper discusses the smart grid, current security issues surrounding machine-to-machine information on the smart grid, and solutions available to identify and avoid cyber threats.}

In particular, we discuss the efficient use of “ant robots” for covering a connected region on the Z2 grid, whose area is unknown in advance, and which expands at a given rate, where n is the initial size of the connected region. We show that regardless of the algorithm used, and the robots’ hardware and software specifications, the minimal number of robots required in order for such a coverage to be possible is Ω(n). In addition, we show that when the region expands at a sufficiently slow rate, a team of Θ(n) robots could cover it in at most O(n2lnn) time. This completion time can even be achieved by myopic robots, with no ability to directly communicate with each other, and where each robot is equipped with a memory of size O(1) bits w.r.t. the size of the region (therefore, the robots cannot maintain maps of the terrain, nor plan complete paths). Regarding the coverage of non-expanding regions in the grid, we improve the current best known result of O(n2) by demonstrating an algorithm that guarantees such a coverage with completion time of O(1kn1.5+n) in the worst case, and faster for shapes of perimeter length which is shorter than O(n).}

abstract = {Cross-site scripting attack (abbreviated as XSS) is an unremitting problem for the Web applications since the early 2000s. It is a code injection attack on the client-side where an attacker injects malicious payload into a vulnerable Web application. The attacker is often successful in eventually executing the malicious code in an innocent user's browser without the user's knowledge. With an XSS attack, an attacker can perform malicious activities such as cookie stealing, session hijacking, redirection to other malicious sites, downloading of unwanted software and spreading of malware. The primary categories of XSS attacks are: non-persistent and persistent XSS attacks. This survey focuses on studying comprehensively, the detection methods available in the literature for XSS attacks. The detection methods discussed in this study are classified according to their deployment sites and further sub-classified according to the analysis mechanism they employ. Along with discussing the pros and cons of each method, this survey also presents a list of tools that support detection of XSS attacks. We also discuss in detail three preconditions that has to be met in order to successfully launch an XSS attack. One of the prime objectives of this survey is to identify a list of issues and open research challenges. This survey can be used as a foundational reading manual by anyone wishing to understand, assess, establish or design a detection mechanism to counter XSS attack.}

However, secure and reliable clustering, which is critical in WSNs deployed in hostile environments, has gained modest attention so far or has been limited only to fault tolerance. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art of clustering protocols in WSNs with special emphasis on security and reliability issues. First, we define a taxonomy of security and reliability for cluster head election and clustering in WSNs. Then, we describe and analyze the most relevant secure and reliable clustering protocols. Finally, we propose countermeasures against typical attacks and show how they improve the discussed protocols.}

This malware is the consequence of multiple processes cooperating to fulfill a malicious task each of which performing a partition of main task and none of them shows an identifiable malicious behavior. In this paper, we have presented a new method called PbMMD for detecting Multi-process malware. In this method, we attempt to inspect the whole processes running on the system and discover collaborative processes by finding processes running along a common execution policy. Beforehand we have learned different execution policy by employing reinforcement algorithm.

This negatively impacts sub-communities on these platforms that often require trusted members especially when they are intended to be used for exchange of valuable goods or services. Prior research on identity deception detection on social platforms has focused on identifying features that are effective in detecting these accounts. These studies often utilize years of historical data to demonstrate the effectiveness of detection models. However, to this day, there has not been a classification and comparison of these detection features that have been used in past studies. Furthermore, for these features to become viable for wider implementation in large social platforms, a reduction in the volume of data necessary for the fine operation of these models is necessary. This paper proposes a proactive approach to detecting malicious accounts at the point of attempted entry into a sub-community. We constructed a taxonomy of features based on user data and provide a comparison of their efficacy as well as opportunities for reducing data requirements for these types of detection models. The features are generalized so that they can be applied to other social media platforms.}

Big Data Cybersecurity Analytics (BDCA) systems leverage big data technologies for analyzing security events data to protect organizational networks, computers, and data from cyber attacks.
Objective
We aimed at identifying the most frequently reported quality attributes and architectural tactics for BDCA systems.
Method
We used Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method for reviewing 74 papers.
Result
Our findings are twofold: (i) identification of 12 most frequently reported quality attributes for BDCA systems; and (ii) identification and codification of 17 architectural tactics for addressing the identified quality attributes. The identified tactics include six performance tactics, four accuracy tactics, two scalability tactics, three reliability tactics, and one security and usability tactic each.
Conclusion
Our study reveals that in the context of BDCA (a) performance, accuracy and scalability are the most important quality concerns (b) data analytics is the most critical architectural component (c) despite the significance of interoperability, modifiability, adaptability, generality, stealthiness, and privacy assurance, these quality attributes lack explicit architectural support (d) empirical investigation is required to evaluate the impact of the codified tactics and explore the quality trade-offs and dependencies among the tactics and (e) the reported tactics need to be modelled using a standardized modelling language such as UML.}

abstract = {To handle the security threat faced by the widespread use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices due to the ever-lasting increase of malware, the security researchers increasingly rely on machine learning techniques based on various static and/or dynamic features. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art detection techniques may fail to identify the malware effectively because the malware is often obfuscated to camouflage its characteristics and thwart the analysis process. In order to identify the disguised malware accurately, a malware detection framework named MalInsight is proposed by profiling malware from three aspects which are basic structure, low-level behavior, and high-level behavior. These aspects reflect the structural features, the underlying operations interacting with the OS, and the operations on the files, the registry, and the network respectively. Based on the above findings, an accurate and rich feature space is built which enables to depict and detect malware more effectively. In order to validate the effectiveness of MalInsight, an extensive experiment is conducted on a real-world malware dataset. Our experimental results show that MalInsight can detect not only obfuscated malware instances with an accuracy of 99.76% but also unseen and new malware with an accuracy of 97.21%. Furthermore, MalInsight can classify the malware samples into their families with an accuracy of 94.2% outperforming the typical detection approach based on the API sequence as the dynamic behavior features by almost 9%. In addition, the importance of the three aspects is evaluated and sorted quantitatively demonstrating that these aspects play the same effects with the optimal feature set.}

However, when dat has many outliers, outliers also pollute the model. The model then becomes unreliable, thus rendering most outlier detectors to become ineffective. To solve this problem, we propose a mean-shift outlier detector. This detector employs a mean-shift technique to modify data and cancel the bias caused by the outliers. The mean-shift technique replaces every object by the mean of its k-nearest neighbors which essentially removes the effect of outliers before clustering without the need to know the outliers. In addition, it also detects outliers based on the distance shifted. Our experiments show that the proposed method works well regardless of the number of outliers in the data. This method outperforms all state-of-the-art methods tested, with both real-world numeric datasets as well as generated numeric and string datasets.}

A significant amount of work has been done on human activity recognition and researchers have leveraged different approaches, such as wearable, object-tagged, and device-free, to recognize human activities. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of the work conducted over the 10-year period of 2010–2019 in various areas of human activity recognition with main focus on device-free solutions. The device-free approach is becoming very popular due to the fact that the subject is not required to carry anything. Instead, the environment is tagged with devices to capture the required information. We propose a new taxonomy for categorizing the research work conducted in the field of activity recognition and divide the existing literature into three sub-areas: action-based, motion-based, and interaction-based. We further divide these areas into ten different sub-topics and present the latest research works in these sub-topics. Unlike previous surveys which focus only on one type of activities, to the best of our knowledge, we cover all the sub-areas in activity recognition and provide a comparison of the latest research work in these sub-areas. Specifically, we discuss the key attributes and design approaches for the work presented. Then we provide extensive analysis based on 10 important metrics, to present a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art techniques and trends in different sub-areas of device-free human activity recognition.

Its tweet-processing pipeline is composed of filtering, feature extraction, binary classification, an innovative clustering strategy, and generation of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). A quantitative evaluation considering over 195.000 tweets from 80 accounts over more than 8 months, shows that our approach successfully finds the majority of security-related tweets concerning an example IT infrastructure (true positive rate above 90%), incorrectly selects a small number of tweets as relevant (false positive rate under 10%), and summarises the results in few IoCs per day. A qualitative evaluation of the IoCs generated by SYNAPSE demonstrates their relevance, and timeliness. Finally, we provide some highlights of a real-world integration of SYNAPSE with the Security Operation Center of a nation-wide electric utility.}

abstract = {The use of network applications to manage network operations by the controller in SDN architecture introduces a threat that makes the controller to be susceptible to several network attacks. This is possible because the network applications operate without any access control mechanism that authenticates or dictates what operations they can execute in the network. This consequently makes the network applications to take advantage of their ability to manipulate, change or modify network state to compromise network operations and resources. In order to address this problem this paper introduces a token-based authentication method that enables the controller to authenticate the various network applications. The application of this method builds an access permission zone where only legitimate network applications with the correct token credentials can have access to the network prior to implementing any network changes. This paper contributes in providing an authorisation method Boolean Access Matrix that enforces permission constraints on what the network applications can access or execute within the network. The authorisation method helps limits the unprecedented access the network applications have over the control layer resources, core services and the network operations. The paper introduces a novel method of evaluating the trust between the controller and the network application based on Subjective Logic Reasoning (SLR) which is a belief learning model. SLR is an advanced learning algorithm that is derived from Probability Calculus and Statistics. Experiments demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed algorithms in a large scale test environment.}

abstract = {With the significant improvement in deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) into the smart grid infrastructure, the demand for cyber security is rapidly growing. The Energy Internet (EI) also known as the integrated internet-based smart grid and energy resources inherits all the security vulnerabilities of the existing smart grid. The security structure of the smart grid has become inadequate in meeting the security needs of energy domains in the 21st century. In this paper, we propose a cyber security framework capable of providing adequate security and privacy, and supporting efficient energy management in the EI. The proposed framework uses an identity-based security mechanism (I-ICAAAN), a secure communication protocol and an Intelligent Security System for Energy Management (ISSEM) to certify security and privacy in the EI. Nash Equilibrium solution of game theory is applied for the evaluation of our proposed ISSEM based on security events allocation. The formal verification and theoretical analysis show that our proposed framework provides security and privacy improvement for IoT-based EI.}

The characteristic of the Smart Grid that leads to physical damage and cascading power failures amplifies the severity of security breaches. A set of recent successful Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks on the Internet, facilitated by the proliferation of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) powered botnets, shows that the Smart Grid may become the target and likely victim of such an attack, potentially leaving catastrophic outage of power service to millions of people. In this paper, under a hierarchical data collection infrastructure we propose a general and scalable mitigation approach, called Minimally Invasive Attack Mitigation via Detection Isolation and Localization (MIAMI-DIL), based on an online and nonparametric anomaly detection algorithm which is scalable and capable of timely detection. We provide a proof-of-concept by means of simulations to show the efficacy and scalability of the proposed approach.}

Cyber security breaches in such robots undermine the trust between humans and robots. In this paper, we investigate how to apprehend and inflict security threats at the design and implementation stage of an autonomous mobile robot. To this end, we leverage the idea of directed fuzzing and design RoboFuzzthat systematically tests an autonomous mobile robot in line with the robot’s states and the surrounding environment. The methodology of RoboFuzzis to study critical environmental parameters affecting the robot’s state transitions and subject the robot control program with rational but harmful sensor values so as to compromise the robot. Furthermore, we develop detection and mitigation algorithms to counteract the impact of RoboFuzz. The difficulties mainly lie in the trade-off among limited computation resources, timely detection and the retention of work efficiency in mitigation. In particular, we propose detection and mitigation methods that take advantage of historical records of obstacles to detect inconsistent obstacle appearances regarding untrustworthy sensor values and navigate the movable robot to continue moving so as to carry on a planned task. By doing so, we manage to maintain a low cost for detection and mitigation but also retain the robot’s work efficacy. We have prototyped the bundle of RoboFuzz, detection and mitigation algorithms in a real-world movable robot. Experimental results confirm that RoboFuzzmakes a success rate of up to 93.3% in imposing concrete threats to the robot while the overall loss of work efficacy is merely 4.1% at the mitigation mode.}

We use unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) techniques, which are uncommon in tax fraud detection research, to deal with these domain issues. We analyse a unique dataset containing the VAT declarations and client listings of all Belgian VAT numbers pertaining to ten sectors. Our methodology consists in applying AD methods to firms belonging to the same sector and enables an efficient auditing strategy that can be adopted by tax authorities worldwide. The high lifts and hit rates observed in most sectors demonstrate the success of this approach. Sectoral differences exist due to varying market conditions and legal requirements across sectors and we show that the optimal AD method is sector dependent. We focus on three methodological problems that show issues in the related literature. (1) Can we design suitable input features? We develop new fraud indicators from specific fields of the VAT form and client listings and show the predictive value of the combination of these features. (2) Can we design fast algorithms to deal with the large data sizes that can occur in the tax domain? New methods are developed and we demonstrate their scalability both theoretically as well as empirically. (3) How should fraud detection performance be assessed? A new evaluation methodology is proposed that provides reliable performance indications and guarantees that fraud cases are effectively detected by the proposed methods.}

abstract = {The integration of advanced Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the conventional electric power grid is evolving into a Cyber-Physical Power System (CPPS). The seamless integration of control, communication, and computing operations allow CPPS to be fully monitored and controlled. Threats, vulnerabilities, and catastrophic attacks will intrude as CPPS monitoring, protection, and control functions advance. For the CPPS to operate safely, securely, and efficiently, sustainable cybersecurity solutions must be developed, and the power grid's reliability and resilience must be maintained even when exposed to unfavorable network conditions. While more distributed and renewable energy sources are connected to the grid, cybersecurity helps to ensure the supply of electricity is sustainable and of high quality. The validation of such sustainable cybersecurity analysis goes beyond the traditional power grid network analysis, which means that the test should integrate the physical and cyber system behavior and respond to the network attacks. To analyze the cybersecurity and cyberattacks in the practical CPPS, comprehensive and realistic CPPS testbeds are needed. The heterogeneous nature of the CPPS concept urges multidisciplinary testbeds with various functions and capabilities to evaluate the new cyber-attacks, vulnerabilities, and threats in CPPS. Using this CPPS testbed framework, the different types of cyber-attack can be detected, and detection algorithm can be evaluated, and helps to enhance the development of sustainable cybersecurity defenses for realistic CPPS environment with the increasingly dense integration of distributed energy resources (DERs). This Part-I paper review the CPPS testbeds in the view of the physical power system layer, sensing layer, communication layer, control layer, application layer, test platforms, and research goals with the fusion of cyber and physical systems. In addition, this review presented an overview, structure, and application-based evaluation of existing testbeds from the industry and institutions. The various research areas in CPPS are reviewed first to show the research trends on different aspects of CPPS which have gained significant attention in the past decade. The necessity of testbeds for cyberattacks and sustainable cybersecurity analysis in CPPS are then described. Finally, the NIST framework for CPS, CPPS domains, and research areas are presented. Further the Part-II paper will review the classification, overview, and assessment of CPPS testbeds.}

The security metrics are developed to measure the dynamics of a network and a host state's information (e.g., IP address, port, software stacks, vulnerabilities, or network topology) introduced by various types of MTD techniques shuffling them. The key aspect of our proposed metrics is to capture variability that keeps track of changing patterns of the network and the host states upon every MTD triggering event. In this work, we propose the following security metrics capturing the variability based on the changes made by the MTD: (1) Network and host address-based metrics measuring variability of the network and host addresses based on a degree of uncertainty and unpredictability on the assigned IP address to the hosts in a network; (2) Attack path-based metrics measuring variability of attack paths using graphical models estimated based on the network state transitions from one topology to another topology upon triggering a network topology and/or IP shuffling MTD; and (3) Attack stage-based success metrics measuring the chances of discovering a vulnerable target host's information, exploiting the target host's vulnerability, and compromising the target host. Via extensive simulation study, we investigated the key parameters that can significantly affect the MTD performance based on the proposed security metrics. Our simulation results show that the metrics are viable to measure the effectiveness of deploying the MTD techniques.}

Unlike fiat currencies, there is no centralized authority or any statutory recognition, backing, or regulation for Bitcoin. All transactions are confirmed for validity by a network of volunteer nodes (miners) and after collective agreement is subsequently recorded into a distributed ledger “Blockchain”. Bitcoin platform has attracted both social and anti-social elements. On the one hand, it is social as it ensures the exchange of value, maintaining trust in a cooperative, community-driven manner without the need for a trusted third party. At the same time, it is anti-social as it creates hurdles for law enforcement to trace suspicious transactions due to anonymity and privacy. To understand how the social and anti-social tendencies in the user base of Bitcoin affect its evolution, there is a need to analyze the Bitcoin system as a network. The current paper aims to explore the local topology and geometry of the Bitcoin network during its first decade of existence. Bitcoin transaction data from 03 Jan 2009 12:45:05 GMT to 08 May 2020 13:21:33 GMT was processed for this purpose to build a Bitcoin user graph. The characteristics, local and global network properties of the user's graph were analyzed at ten intervals between 2009 and 2020 with a gap of one year. Small diameter, skewed distribution of transactions, power-law distributed in and out degrees, disconnected graph, and presence of large connected components were the observations from network analysis. Thus, it could be inferred that despite anti-social tendencies, Bitcoin network shared similarities with other complex networks. Network analysis also uncovered twenty types of legal and anti-social entities operating on Bitcoin and provided a path for uncovering these anti-social entities.}

Therefore, integrity and availability of computer networks become priorities, making it a fundamental resource to be managed. In this work, a scheme combining Genetic Algorithm and a Fuzzy Logic for network anomaly detection is discussed. The Genetic Algorithm is used to generate a Digital Signature of Network Segment using Flow Analysis, where information extracted from network flows data is used to predict the networks traffic behavior for a given time interval. Furthermore, a Fuzzy Logic scheme is applied to decide whether an instance represents an anomaly or not, differing from some approaches present in the literature. Indeed, it is proposed an expert system with the capability to monitor the network’s traffic with IP flows while expected behaviors are generated in a regular time interval basis, issuing alarms when a possible problem is present. The proposed anomaly detection system exposes network problems autonomously. The results acquired from applying the proposed approach in a real network traffic flows achieve an accuracy of 96.53% and false positive rate of 0.56%. Moreover, our method succeeds in achieving higher performance compared to several other approaches.}

We develop a two-player, zero-sum, extensive-form game to model attacker and defender roles in both physical and cyber space. We reformulate the problem to find a Nash equilibrium using an efficient, sequence-form linear program. Solving this linear program produces optimal defender strategies for the multi-domain security game. We address large problem instances with an application of the approximate counterfactual regret minimization algorithm. This approximation reduces computation time by 95% while maintaining an optimality gap of less than 3%. Our application of discounted counterfactual regret results in a further 36% reduction in computation time from the base algorithm. We develop domain insights through a designed experiment to explore the parameter space of the problem and algorithm. We also address robust opponent exploitation by combining existing techniques to extend the counterfactual regret algorithm to include a discounted, constrained variant. A comparison of robust linear programming, data-biased response, and constrained counterfactual regret approaches clarifies trade-offs between exploitation and exploitability for each method. The robust linear programming approach is the most effective, producing an exploitation to exploitability ratio of 10.8 to 1.}

To address this issue, we propose an enhanced Cypider framework, a set of techniques and tools aiming to perform a systematic detection of mobile malware by building a scalable and obfuscation resilient similarity network infrastructure of malicious apps. Our approach is based on our proposed concept, namely malicious community, in which we consider malicious instances that share common features are the most likely part of the same malware family. Using this concept, we presumably assume that multiple similar Android apps with different authors are most likely to be malicious. Specifically, Cypider leverages this assumption for the detection of variants of known malware families and zero-day malicious apps. Cypider applies community detection algorithms on the similarity network, which extracts sub-graphs considered as suspicious and possibly malicious communities. Furthermore, we propose a novel fingerprinting technique, namely community fingerprint, based on a one-class machine learning model for each malicious community. Besides, we proposed an enhanced Cypider framework, which requires less memory, ≈ x650%, and less time to build the similarity network, ≈ x700, compared to the original version, without affecting the fingerprinting performance of the framework. We introduce a systematic approach to locate the best threshold on different feature content vectors, which simplifies the overall detection process. Cypider shows excellent results by detecting 60%−80% coverage of the malware dataset in one detection iteration with higher precision 85%−99% in the detected malicious communities. On the other hand, the community fingerprints are promising as we achieved 86%, 93%, and 94% in the detection of the malware family, general malware, and benign apps respectively.}

Among these, the attacks targeted at the base station are the most devastating ones since this essential device processes and analyses all traffic generated in the network. Moreover, this feature can be exploited by a passive adversary to determine its location based on traffic analysis. This receiver-location privacy problem can be reduced by altering the traffic pattern of the network but the adversary may still be able to reach the base station if he gains access to the routing tables of a number of sensor nodes. In this paper we present HISP-NC (Homogenous Injection for Sink Privacy with Node Compromise protection), a receiver-location privacy solution that consists of two complementary schemes which protect the location of the base station in the presence of traffic analysis and node compromise attacks. The HISP-NC data transmission protocol prevents traffic analysis by probabilistically hiding the flow of real traffic with moderate amounts of fake traffic. Moreover, HISP-NC includes a perturbation mechanism that modifies the routing tables of the nodes to introduce some level of uncertainty in attackers capable of retrieving the routing information from the nodes. Our scheme is validated both analytically and experimentally through extensive simulations.}

The trust value is adjusted based on the attack intensity to ensure a trustworthy system.

However, while there has been plenty of research on the topic of commodity systems, no current study exists that provides a complete picture of E-IoT systems, their components, and relevant threats. As such, lack of knowledge of E-IoT system threats, coupled with the cost of E-IoT systems has led many to assume that E-IoT systems are secure. To address this research gap, raise awareness on E-IoT security, and motivate further research, this work emphasizes E-IoT system components, E-IoT vulnerabilities, solutions, and their security implications. In order to systematically analyze the security of E-IoT systems, we divide E-IoT systems into four layers: E-IoT Devices Layer, Communications Layer, Monitoring and Applications Layer, and Business Layer. We survey attacks and defense mechanisms, considering the E-IoT components at each layer and the associated threats. In addition, we present key observations in state-of-the-art E-IoT security and provide a list of open research problems that need further research.}

abstract = {The penetration of distributed generators into the power distribution grid requires real-time control of the grid by monitoring the state of the power distribution grid. Such a large-scale monitoring cannot be performed by using traditional Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems due to its lack of the scalability. To address this issue, contemporary Wide Area Measurement Systems (WAMS) are deployed, which provide the dynamic snapshots of the power system. However, WAMS’s more open structure versus SCADA poses a risk of WAMS being vulnerable to cyberattacks. In particular, due to high responsiveness and availability requirements of WAMS applications, attacks i.e., Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed DoS (DDoS) are of primary concern for WAMS. In this paper, we focus on internal DoS/DDoS attacks launched against the WAMS devices by exploiting the vulnerabilities. To counter such attacks, we propose a proactive and robust extension of the Multipath-TCP (MPTCP) transportation protocol, termed as MPTCP-H. The proposed extension mitigates the internal attacks by using a novel stream hopping mechanism, which periodically renews the subflows to hide the open port numbers of the connection. By doing so, MPTCP-H significantly increases the attacker’s cost for a successful attack without perturbing the WAMS data traffic. The experimental results show that the proposed MPTCP-H provides a significant DoS/DDoS attack mitigation for WAMS at the expense of reasonable overheads, i.e., additional latency and message.}

In this paper, we propose a Fault Detection framework for the Component-based Cloud Computing by using Recovery Blocks’ Acceptance Test. This framework aims to construct Fail-Silent Cloud modules which have the ability of Self-Fault detection. In this, the detection process of transient hardware faults, software faults, and response-time failures is performed locally on each computing machine in the Cloud system.

Detection and prevention of anomalous behaviors such as cyber attacks are of vital importance. This paper focuses on a method to detect such anomalous behaviors in near real-time using laptop class processing power. ICSs depend on the sensor measurements to monitor and operate a plant. Moreover, any change in the behaviors of a physical process due to an attack can also be unearthed from the sensor measurements. Under different circumstances, these sensor measurements follow typical patterns. A partially defined Boolean function based supervised classification method, known as Logical Analysis of Data (LAD), can extract patterns (or rules) from historical sensor measurements, and these rules can categorize the condition of a plant. In this paper, these rules are used to design an Anomaly Detection System (ADS) to unearth anomalous behaviors. The efficacy of the proposed method is assessed using the sensor measurements from a testbed known as Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) system. The proposed technique is generic and can be extended to other ICSs such as power and transportation. Additionally, compared to other anomaly detection approaches, LAD-based ADS also helps to localize the anomaly.}

This requires building a reliable EV charging ecosystem that serves customer demands while ensuring the security of the Internet-enabled systems and the connected critical infrastructure against possible cyber attacks. To this end, we devise a system lookup and collection approach to obtain a representative sample of widely deployed EV Charging Station Management Systems (EVCSMS). Furthermore, we leverage reverse engineering and penetration testing techniques to perform a first-of-a-kind comprehensive security and vulnerability analysis of the identified EVCSMS and their software/firmware implementations. Indeed, our systematic analysis unveils an array of vulnerabilities, which demonstrate the insecurity of the EVCSMS against remote cyber attacks. Considering the feasibility of such attacks, we discuss attack implications against the EV charging stations (EVCS) and their users. More importantly, we simulate the impact of practical cyber attack scenarios against the power grid, which result in possible service disruption and failure in the grid. Finally, while we recommend mitigation measures, our discoveries raise concerns about the lack of adequate security considerations in the design of the deployed EVCS, which will motivate vendors to take immediate action to patch their developed systems. Indeed, our communication with the concerned parties resulted in positive responses from some vendors such as Schneider Electric, who acknowledged our findings by reserving 12 CVEs, respectively.}

More critically, a false data injection attack could influence both accuracy of state estimates and the evaluation of system dynamics. Typically, false data sequences are modeled as multi-constraint non-linear optimization with random, step, or ramp type distribution. However, a carefully designed attack that mimics the dynamic response of a natural disturbance can hugely impact trends-based applications of synchrophasor-based disturbance monitoring and mode metering. This work designs a multi-channel/multi-sample dynamic injection attack in phasor trends to closely mimic natural disturbances aiming at trends-based applications. Also, the work proposes an un-supervised wavelet probability mapping method for the detection and correction of dynamic false data sequences. The proposed method identifies the attack sequences from disturbances using relative wavelet energy measure and replaces the corrupted sub-sequences with coherent un-corrupted trends using a kernel density estimation-based mode mapping method. The efficacy of the proposed method is validated for simulated injection cases in IEEE-118 bus system using DigSILENT/PowerFactory and real phasor data for the Eastern region of the India grid. The results show that the proposed method exhibits high detection accuracy and low correction error for different categories of dynamic false data cases under real system conditions.}

Security frameworks modeled using an ontological approach are a promising new line of defense that can be highly effective in detecting zero day and sophisticated web application attacks because they can capture the context of the contents of information such as HTML pages or in-line scripts and have the ability to filter these contents by taking into consideration their consequences to the target applications. The goal of this article is to demonstrate how an ontology-engineering methodology may be systematically applied for designing and evaluating such security systems. A detailed ontological model is shown that caters to the generalized working of web applications, the underlying communication protocols and attacks. More specifically the proposed ontological model because it captures the context can not only detect HTTP protocol specification attacks but also helps focus only on specific portions of the request and response where a malicious script is possible. The model also captures the context of important attacks, the various technologies used by the hackers, source, target and vulnerabilities exploited by the attack, impact on system components and controls for mitigation. A comprehensive and best metrics suite for ontology evaluation has been used for assessing the quality of proposed model which includes correctness, accuracy, consistency, soundness, task orientation, completeness, conciseness, expandability, reusability, clarity, integrity, efficiency and expressiveness. The proposed model ranked well against the above mentioned metrics. Moreover a prototype attack detection system based upon the proposed model showed improved performance and detection rate and low rate of false positives while detecting OWASP's top ten listed web attacks.}

abstract = {We consider the problem faced by a network administrator (defender) when deploying limited security resources to protect a network against a strategic attacker. To evaluate the effectiveness of a defense strategy, one must consider possible counterattacks that an attacker can choose. We use game theory to model the interaction between the defender and the attacker. Game theory provides relevant concepts and algorithms for computing optimal strategies in environments with multiple decision makers. To model the space of attacker’s possible actions, we use attack graphs, that compactly represent all known sequences of attacker’s action that may lead to successful attack for a given network. We demonstrate our approach on a specific type of defense actions, where the defender deploys deceptive hosts and services (honeypots) to detect and mitigate attacks. We assume the worst-case attacker who has a complete knowledge of the (typically randomized) defense strategy. We seek the optimal defense strategy against this attacker in the form of a Stackelberg equilibrium. Computing this solution exactly using standard techniques has limited scalability, so we investigate several approaches for increasing scalability to realistic problems. We introduce optimization methods for finding exact solutions for these games and then propose a variety of polynomial heuristic algorithms that scale to significantly larger games. We analyze the scalability and the quality of these heuristic solutions on realistic network topologies. We show that the strategies found by the heuristics are often near-optimal and that they outperform non-game-theoretic baselines. Finally, we show how attack graph games can be used to answer various research questions relevant to network security administrators.}

abstract = {Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies have received significant interest in various areas beyond the financial sector, with profound applications in the Internet of Things (IoT), providing the means for creating truly trustless and secure solutions for IoT applications. Taking into account the weak security defences that the majority of IoT devices have, it is critical that a blockchain-based solution targeting the IoT is not only capable of addressing the many challenges IoT is facing, but also does not introduce other defects, e.g. in terms of performance, making its adoption hard to achieve. This paper aims at addressing the above needs by providing a comprehensive and coherent review of the available blockchain solutions to determine their ability to meet the requirements and tackle the challenges of the IoT, using the smart home as the reference domain. Key architectural aspects of blockchain solutions, like the platforms’ software and network setups, the consensus protocols used, as well as smart contracts, are examined in terms of their ability to withstand various types of common IoT and blockchain attacks, deliver enhanced privacy features, and assure adequate performance levels while processing large amounts of transactions being generated in an IoT environment. The analysis carried out identified that the defences currently provided by blockchain platforms are not sufficient to thwart all the prominent attacks against blockchains, with blockchain 1.0 and 2.0 platforms being susceptible to the majority of them. On the other side, privacy related mechanisms are being supported, to varying degrees, by all platforms investigated; however, each of the them tackles specific only privacy aspects, thus rendering the overall privacy evaluation a challenging task which needs to be considered in an ad-hoc basis. If the underlying consensus protocols’ performance and fault tolerance is also considered, then only a small number of platforms meet the requirements of our reference IoT domain.}

In our problem, the attacker uses lateral movement through the network in order to reach a specific host, while the defender wants to discover the attacker by dynamically reallocating honeypots. We demonstrate that restricting to a specific domain allows us to substantially improve existing algorithms: (1) we formulate a compact representation of uncertainty the defender faces, (2) we exploit the incremental strategy-generation method that over iterations expands the possible actions for players. The experimental evaluation shows that our novel algorithms scale several orders of magnitude better compared to the existing state of the art.}

However, channel insecurity and battery limitation may not protect the aerial coverage area. Thus, sensitive information gathered through aerial vehicles causes security threats. To manage the security issues, Smart Internet of Drone (S-IoD) have been evolved to use Intelligent Personal Assistant (IPA) as a software agent while monitoring and observing areas of interest. The current state-of-the-art technologies provide ubiquitous communication to enable several Internet of Things (IoT) paradigms. It achieves a feature of a decision support system that allows the smart interaction and communication between real-time entities. IPA offers smart interaction with other smart real-time entities to gain the user’s knowledge and awareness. This paper presents an S-IoD framework for a UAV environment that independently collects sensible information. In order to reduce the computation cost of the authentication protocol, a lightweight privacy-preserving scheme (L-PPS) is introduced. The proposed L-PPS is constructive to provide the robustness between the IoT devices with a valid authentication period. To demonstrate the security and performance efficiencies, the formal verification was performed using a verification tool, Scyther, and a random oracle model. In addition, the proposed L-PPS introduces a secret token and dynamic user authentication to speed up the authentication process between the communication entities. Importantly, the authentication session of L-PPS does not use any complex cryptographic operations, whereby it has less computation and communication costs to meet the standard constraints of surveillance systems. Moreover, the obtained simulation analysis proves that the proposed L-PPS achieves better quality metrics than other authentication schemes in the literature.}

To address this issue, we propose an enhanced Cypider framework, a set of techniques and tools aiming to perform a systematic detection of mobile malware by building a scalable and obfuscation resilient similarity network infrastructure of malicious apps. Our approach is based on our proposed concept, namely malicious community, in which we consider malicious instances that share common features are the most likely part of the same malware family. Using this concept, we presumably assume that multiple similar Android apps with different authors are most likely to be malicious. Specifically, Cypider leverages this assumption for the detection of variants of known malware families and zero-day malicious apps. Cypider applies community detection algorithms on the similarity network, which extracts sub-graphs considered as suspicious and possibly malicious communities. Furthermore, we propose a novel fingerprinting technique, namely community fingerprint, based on a one-class machine learning model for each malicious community. Besides, we proposed an enhanced Cypider framework, which requires less memory,  ≈ x650%, and less time to build the similarity network,  ≈ x700, compared to the original version, without affecting the fingerprinting performance of the framework. We introduce a systematic approach to locate the best threshold on different feature content vectors, which simplifies the overall detection process. Cypider shows excellent results by detecting 60−80% coverage of the malware dataset in one detection iteration with higher precision 85−99% in the detected malicious communities. On the other hand, the community fingerprints are promising as we achieved 86%, 93%, and 94% in the detection of the malware family, general malware, and benign apps, respectively.}

abstract = {Nowadays, many companies still use old and insecure protocols in Industrial Control Systems (ICSs). An example of such protocols is Modbus, one of the most employed industrial protocols. Also, companies are moving to Modbus/TCP when there are TCP devices involved in the facility. While remaining insecure, this migration also disrupts the assumption of air-gapped industrial networks, opening more attack surface to previously isolated systems. Due to legacy and efficiency constraint, the replacement of Modbus/TCP with secure protocols is not possible, generating big security issues. In this paper, we present TAMBUS (Transmitter Authentication and packet integrity in Modbus/TCP). This method is the first that at the same time: is not implemented in a secure by obscurity design and keeps the Modbus/TCP protocol compatible with legacy devices. TAMBUS allows detecting attacks with high statistical confidence, by leveraging two covert channels as a mean of providing security: 1) Storage-based, that hides authentication messages into the Modbus/TCP protocol fields; 2) Timing-based, that considers the inter-arrival time of packets. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our method through a prototype implementation and testing in an industrial testbed environment. Our experiments confirm that TAMBUS introduces only a small overhead, negligible in most application, and it preserves the regular functioning of industrial systems. In particular, considering the storage-based covert channel, TAMBUS introduces an error into transmitted values of only 1.19×10−5%, without traffic overhead. On the other hand, TAMBUS can transmit correct security information through the timing-based covert channel with an accuracy of more than 99.99%.}

Due to physical constraints, embedded computers and networks may give rise to some additional security vulnerabilities, which results in losses of enormous economy benefits or disorder of social life. As a result, it is of significant to properly investigate the security issue of CPSs to ensure that such systems are operating in a safe manner. This paper, from a control theory perspective, presents an overview of recent advances on security control and attack detection of industrial CPSs. First, the typical system modeling on CPSs is summarized to cater for the requirement of the performance analysis. Then three typical types of cyber-attacks, i.e. denial-of-service attacks, replay attacks, and deception attacks, are disclosed from an engineering perspective. Moreover, robustness, security and resilience as well as stability are discussed to govern the capability of weakening various attacks. The development on attack detection for industrial CPSs is reviewed according to the categories on detection approaches. Furthermore, the security control and state estimation are discussed in detail. Finally, some challenge issues are raised for the future research.}

The proposed multi-stage methodology employs natural language processing and machine learning. The methodology first discovers (i) named entities, which includes names of people, organizations, and locations; and (ii) hidden topics, using (a) Conditional Random Field (CRF) and (b) Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) operating on both phishing and non-phishing data. Utilizing topics and named entities as features, the next stage classifies each message as phishing or non-phishing using AdaBoost. For messages classified as phishing, the final stage discovers the impersonated entity using CRF. Experimental results show that the phishing classifier detects phishing attacks with no misclassification when the proportion of phishing emails is less than 20%. The F-measure obtained was 100%. Our approach also discovers the impersonated entity from messages that are classified as phishing, with a discovery rate of 88.1%. The automatic discovery of impersonated entity from phishing helps the legitimate organization to take down the offending phishing site. This protects their users from falling for phishing attacks, which in turn leads to satisfied customers. Automatic discovery of an impersonated entity also helps email service providers to collaborate with each other to exchange attack information and protect their customers.}

abstract = {Nowadays, network traffic analysis is quite pervasive in human practice. Website fingerprinting attack, which is a new variant of traffic analysis attacks, identifies the websites visited by clients in encrypted and anonymized Tor connections by observing patterns in packet flows. Previous website fingerprinting attacks focus on static models in which the classifier is trained within a time period and then it is utilized to identify targeted websites. Static attacks cannot handle the time effect on the accuracy since their classifiers are not trained on the newest versions of the websites. Consequently, their accuracy drops drastically when tested on captured traffic traces of websites, days after training. This time effect is known as concept drift. In order to maintain the performance of the classifier, the classifier must be updated over time. In static attacks, updating the classifier includes updating the whole dataset again along with retraining the classifier. Recollecting, maintaining, and updating datasets as well as updating and retraining the classifier are very time and memory consuming. To deal with the emerging issues arising from concept drift and expensive retraining phases, this paper proposes AdaWFPA; an adaptive online website fingerprinting attack which is based on adaptive stream mining algorithms. AdaWFPA avoids concept drift by updating its model over time. Our empirical analyses and experiments over real world datasets indicate the superiority of our approach; as it offers better accuracy, precision, and recall in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in the literature.}

abstract = {Recently, the world witnessed a significant increase in the number of used drones, with a global and continuous rise in the demand for their multi-purpose applications. The pervasive aspect of these drones is due to their ability to answer people’s needs. Drones are providing users with a bird’s eye that can be activated and used almost anywhere and at any time. However, recently, the malicious use of drones began to emerge among criminals and cyber-criminals alike. The probability and frequency of these attacks are both high and their impact can be very dangerous with devastating effects. Therefore, the need for detective, protective and preventive counter-measures is highly required. The aim of this survey is to investigate the emerging threats of using drones in cyber-attacks, along the countermeasures to thwart these attacks. The different uses of drones for malicious purposes are also reviewed, along the possible detection methods. As such, this paper analyzes the exploitation of drones vulnerabilities within communication links, as well as smart devices and hardware, including smart-phones and tablets. Moreover, this paper presents a detailed review on the drone/Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) usage in multiple domains (i.e civilian, military, terrorism, etc.) and for different purposes. A realistic attack scenario is also presented, which details how the authors performed a simulated attack on a given drone following the hacking cycle. This review would greatly help ethical hackers to understand the existing vulnerabilities of UAVs in both military and civilian domains. Moreover, it allows them to adopt and come up with new techniques and technologies for enhanced UAV attack detection and protection. As a result, various civilian and military anti-drones/UAVs (detective and preventive) countermeasures will be reviewed.}

The mobile node’s property is dynamic, so it isn’t easy to manage security policies. These difficulties present a barrier to building multigene security arrangements that accomplish both assurance and attractive network execution. The proposed work suggests the mutual authentication-based protocol, helping in the handshake between two nodes. Once they connected securely through this mechanism, they can interchange the required information. We have a monitoring node that will maintain the access list of the authorized nodes. The monitoring node will keep the nodes’ list based on the MAC address of nodes and digital signature key. The key is generated by combining the hash code of the MAC address with the variety of the user’s fingerprint file acting as a node. The combination of both will verify the entity. It involves the various subsections that include registering the user, token generation, sending and receiving messages through multiple algorithms. The proposed work is implemented using MATLAB. The analysis of the base work and the proposed work is visualized by structuring the GUI. Due to all the strength of the pattern of session token is further validated using the various online password checking tools, and the results obtained are quite impressive. Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) is a cryptographic hashing algorithm used to decide a specific bit of information’s integrity. In the proposed method, we used different types of keys with additional entropy to check the trust level of password security. The result has been discussed using various entropy graphs that prove improvement over the existing approach.}

Data was collected through a survey and a series of interviews with key actors in the sector in conjunction with a national level crisis management exercise. The data was then analyzed and contrasted to theory. Conclusions were drawn and results discussed. Finally, possible mitigation actions were suggested. It was found that actors in the Swedish financial sector have a well developed crisis management working concept. However, information about rational adversaries that cause prolonged disturbances is possibly not collected, analyzed and utilized systematically. Much effort is put into ensuring that timely and relevant information from organizations is shared in an efficient manner. The sector perceives cyber-threats against the underlying financial infrastructure, as well as against IT service availability and data confidentiality, besides financial theft. The sector has particular concerns for the potential of reputational loss due to cyberattacks. There are also special concerns about the insider threat. Respondents agree that risk management has to account for cyber risk. A possible route to enhance risk management practices is to ensure that cyber personnel is integrated in crisis management teams.}

This is largely due to the open nature of the Android framework that facilitates the incorporation of third-party applications running on top of any Android device. Inter-process communication is one of the most notable features of the Android framework as it allows the reuse of components across process boundaries. This mechanism is used as gateway to access different sensitive services in the Android framework. In the Android platform, this communication system is usually driven by a late runtime binding messaging object known as Intent. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of Android Intents (explicit and implicit) as a distinguishing feature for identifying malicious applications. We show that Intents are semantically rich features that are able to encode the intentions of malware when compared to other well-studied features such as permissions. We also argue that this type of feature is not the ultimate solution. It should be used in conjunction with other known features. We conducted experiments using a dataset containing 7406 applications that comprise 1846 clean and 5560 infected applications. The results show detection rate of 91% using Android Intent against 83% using Android permission. Additionally, experiment on combination of both features results in detection rate of 95.5%.}

Low rate DDoS attacks, especially pulsing attacks, aim to degrade the Quality of Service experienced by users by using only a small amount of attack traffic, unlike conventional volume-based DDoS attacks. To improve the effectiveness and stealthiness, these pulsing attacks assume that the attack packet is concentrated on the server in a very short time (a few milliseconds) using state-of-the-art synchronization techniques. However, even with the most advanced technology in the real world, it is almost impossible to achieve this tight level of synchronization, which means the effectiveness of the pulsing attack can be overestimated based on the exceeded assumption. In this paper, we use the Very Short Intermittent DDoS attack (VSI-DDoS) as an example to measure the practical effectiveness of a pulsing attack in a realistic environment. We found that VSI-DDoSbecame substantially less effective. That is, it lost 85.7% in terms of effectiveness under about 90ms synchronization inaccuracy, which is a very small inaccuracy under normal network conditions.}

Fog devices which aim to be at a shorter distance with the user, access data from the cloud itself. Hence, exchanging data between the cloud and fog device(s) is required and in this context security and privacy come into the picture to provide data confidentiality. This paper first shows an architecture for the data flow model between the cloud and fog computing and then designs an authentication protocol with proper key establishment between the cloud, fog, and user. We have simulated the proposed protocol using a popular simulator i.e., Scyther and proved that the parameters used in our protocol are strongly protected during protocol execution. Besides, our informal security analysis also confirms the robustness of the protocol. Our protocol achieves quick responses in comparison with state-of-the-art because of less computation overhead.}

In this manuscript, a trust-based monitoring (TBM) scheme was designed for improving the security features in cloud-assisted IoT environments. This security scheme employs middleware and intelligent agents for managing user- and communication-level security. TBM operates in three security administering phases namely spoof detection, trust construction, and message authentication. The intelligent agents are responsible for ensuring secure communication by exchanging trust and signal strength observations with the middleware. These agents also assist with monitoring, processing, and task switching to reduce communication costs. TBM was evaluated through extensive simulations. The results demonstrate its consistency in achieving lower response and detection times, misdetection probabilities, and false positive rates. In addition, it was found to improve network lifetime through reduced energy consumption.}

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to predict the risk of malicious insider threats prior to a breach taking place. Firstly, we propose a new framework for insider threat risk prediction, drawing on technical, organisational and human factor perspectives. Secondly, we employ a Bayesian network to model and implement the proposed framework. Furthermore, this Bayesian network-based prediction model is evaluated in a range of challenging environments. The risk level predictions for each authorised users within the organisation are examined so that any insider threat risk can be identified. The proposed insider threat prediction model achieved better results when compared to the empirical judgments of security experts}

Unlike traditionly anomaly detection, group anomaly detection aims to discover the anomalous aggregate behaviors in data points. Over past decades, a large number of promising methods have been successfully applied for group anomaly detection. However, they inherently neglect the correlations among groups in data points, limiting their abilities. This paper presents a correlated hierarchical generative model, which can model the intricate correlations hidden in groups by introducing a logistic normal distribution to capture the correlations among groups. With the proposed model, we construct a full variational Bayesian framework, which can data-adaptively optimize the model parameters of the proposed model. The model is designed and trained using Genetic Algorithm (GA), which helps automating the use of generative model. Further, a new score function is proposed as an anomaly criterion to estimate final anomaly groups in data points. Several experiments on synthetic data and real astronomical star data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method compared with the-state-of-art methods, in terms of average accurac (AP) and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic(ROC) curve(AUC).}

This paper proposes an Enhanced Certificate Revocation Scheme with Justification Facility (ECRSJF) for certificate revocation to separate attackers from additional participation in network performance. In addition, to enhance the dependability of the methodology, we recuperate cautioned nodes to include in the certificate revocation procedure. To improve the correctness, we suggest a threshold-related method to evaluate and justify cautioned nodes as legal nodes. The overall performance of the ECRSJF scheme is evaluated by simulation. The performance results reveal that the certificate revocation scheme is successful and competent to protected communication in MANETs. The simulation results prove that our projected scheme provides the packet delivery ratio and revocation rate as 91% and 95% respectively. These results are better compared to those of the other existing schemes even in the presence of large number of attacker nodes.}

Moreover, security concerns are potentially augmented considering the logical centralization of network intelligence. Furthermore, the security and dependability of the SDN has largely been a neglected topic and remains an open issue. The paper presents a broad overview of the security implications of each SDN layer/interface. This paper contributes further by devising a contemporary layered/interface taxonomy of the reported security vulnerabilities, attacks, and challenges of SDN. We also highlight and analyze the possible threats on each layer/interface of SDN to help design secure SDNs. Moreover, the ensuing paper contributes by presenting the state-of-the-art SDNs security solutions.

A main reason for this limitation is the expectation that an ADS should achieve very high accuracy while having extremely low computational complexity. The constraint of low computational cost has recently been relaxed with the emergence of cheap high-performance platforms (e.g., multi-core, GPU, SCC, etc.). Moreover, current ADSs perform anomaly detection on aggregate feature spaces, with large volumes of benign and close-to-benign feature instances that overwhelm the feature space and hence yield low accuracies. In this paper, we ask and address the following question: Can the accuracy of an ADS be improved if we slice ADS feature space at the cost of higher computational resource utilization? We first observe that existing ADSs are not designed to exploit better computational platforms to achieve higher accuracies. To mitigate this problem, we identify the fundamental accuracy limiting factors for statistical network and host-based ADSs. We then show that these bottlenecks can be alleviated by our proposed feature space slicing framework. Our framework slices a statistical ADS׳ feature space into multiple disjoint subspaces and then performs anomaly detection separately on each subspace by utilizing more computational resources. We propose generic information-theoretic methods for feature space slicing and for determining the appropriate number of subspaces for any statistical ADS. Performance evaluation on three independently-collected attack datasets and multiple ID algorithms shows that the enhanced ADSs are able to achieve dramatic improvements in detection (up to 75%) and false alarm (up to 99%) rates.}

abstract = {The use of cyberspace as a platform for military operations has been growing at impressive rates. Yet, it is still a relatively new area that poses considerable research challenges. Security techniques are not sufficiently effective to protect IT systems and most fail to address the correlation between actions and effects across multiple domains. In other words, identifying how actions performed in the cyber domain affect the mission goals is yet an unsolved problem. This research presents a potential solution and proposes a framework that links the cyber and the operations domains, evaluating how actions in the first impact the effectiveness of missions in the latter. The framework, Cyber-ARGUS, is a Command and Control (C2) support system comprised of a set of tools that provides coherent and consistent mapping between the two domains. Relevant information about the nodes of a cyber infrastructure supporting an operation is stored in a knowledge base, and then used to build a Bayesian Network that provides impact assessment. The technique is illustrated through the simulation of an air transportation scenario in which the C2 infrastructure is subjected to various cyber-attacks, and Cyber-ARGUS is used to assess their associated impact to the air operations. The main contribution of this research is the methodology that enables assessing the cyber impact to ongoing missions. One major advantage of the technique is that it achieves this by calculating the combined effects produced by the attackers and defenders plans, without the requirement of knowing the hard-to-assess enemy's individual actions.}

abstract = {Virtual Private LAN services (VPLS) is a Layer 2 Virtual Private Network (L2VPN) service that has gained immense popularity due to a number of its features, such as protocol independence, multipoint-to-multipoint mesh connectivity, robust security, low operational cost (in terms of optimal resource utilization), and high scalability. In addition to the traditional VPLS architectures, novel VPLS solutions have been designed leveraging new emerging paradigms, such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV), to keep up with the increasing demand. These emerging solutions help in enhancing scalability, strengthening security, and optimizing resource utilization. This paper aims to conduct an in-depth survey of various VPLS architectures and highlight different characteristics through insightful comparisons. Moreover, the article discusses numerous technical aspects such as security, scalability, compatibility, tunnel management, operational issues, and complexity, along with the lessons learned. Finally, the paper outlines future research directions related to VPLS. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to furnish a detailed survey of VPLS.}

abstract = {There is a continuous increase in the sophistication that modern malware exercise in order to bypass the deployed security mechanisms. A typical approach to evade the identification and potential take down of a botnet command and control server is domain fluxing through the use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs). These algorithms produce a vast amount of domain names that the infected device tries to communicate with to find the C&C server, yet only a small fragment of them is actually registered. This allows the botmaster to pivot the control and make the work of seizing the botnet control rather difficult. Current state of the art and practice considers that the DNS queries performed by a compromised device are transparent to the network administrator and therefore can be monitored, analysed, and blocked. In this work, we showcase that the latter is a strong assumption as malware could efficiently hide its DNS queries using covert and/or encrypted channels bypassing the detection mechanisms. To this end, we discuss possible mitigation measures based on traffic analysis to address the new challenges that arise from this approach.}

The most complex of these threats unfold in stages, as actors exploit multiple attack vectors in a sequence of calculated steps. Deciding how to respond to such serious threats poses a challenge that is of substantial practical relevance to IT security managers. These critical decisions require an understanding of the threat actors—including their various motivations, resources, capabilities, and points of access—as well as detailed knowledge about the complex interplay of attack vectors at their disposal. In practice, however, security decisions are often made in response to acute short-term requirements, which results in inefficient resource allocations and ineffective overall threat mitigation. The decision support methodology introduced in this paper addresses this issue. By anchoring IT security managers’ decisions in an operational model of the organization’s information infrastructure, we provide the means to develop a better understanding of security problems, improve situational awareness, and bridge the gap between strategic security investment and operational implementation decisions. To this end, we combine conceptual modeling of security knowledge with a simulation-based optimization that hardens a modeled infrastructure against simulated attacks, and provide a decision support component for selecting from efficient combinations of security controls. We describe the prototypical implementation of this approach, demonstrate how it can be applied, and discuss the results of an in-depth expert evaluation.}

Parallel implementations on the Tilera 64-core System on Chip and the Xilinx Virtex 5-LX FPGA are presented. For the Tilera, we employ a reduced state machine to recognize dictionary terms without requiring explicit tokenization, and achieve throughput of 37 MB/s at a slightly reduced accuracy. For the FPGA, we have developed a set of software tools to help automate the process of converting training data to synthesizable hardware and to provide a means of trading off between accuracy and resource utilization. The Xilinx Virtex 5-LX implementation requires 0.2% of the memory used by the original algorithm. At 166 MB/s (80X the software) the hardware implementation is able to achieve Gigabit network throughput at the same accuracy as the original algorithm.}

It facilitates users to use the Internet service, promotes service providers to enrich services, and makes Internet more security. Personally identifiable information (PII) is the most important information asset with which identity provider (IdP) can provide various services. Since PII is sensitive to users, it has become a serious problem that PII is leaked, illegal selected, illegal accessed. In order to improve security of PII, this study develops a novel framework using data mining to forecast information asset value and find appropriate security level for protecting user PII. The framework has two stages. In the first stage, user information asset is forecasted by data mining tool (decision tree) from PII database. Then security level for user PII is determined by the information asset value assuming that the higher information asset is, the more security requirement of PII is. In the second stage, with time being, number of illegal access and attack can be accumulated. It can be used to reconstruct the decision tree and update the knowledge base combined with the result of the first stage. Thus security level of PII can be timely adjusted and the protection of PII can be guaranteed even when security threat changes. Furthermore, an empirical case was studied in a user dataset to demonstrate the protection decision derived from the framework for various PII. Simulation results show that the framework with data mining can protect PII effectively. Our work can benefit the development of e-business service.}

However, despite many efforts in this direction, key challenges remain. These include the high computational requirements of processing large amounts of network information, the similarity between botnet and normal traffic, and the constant creation of new botnet mechanisms to bypass current detection approaches. Because of these challenges, existing detection approaches have difficulties in detecting novel botnets with high accuracy and low false positive rate. In this paper, we address this problem with an scalable and decentralized framework. Our framework creates a complete characterization of the behavior of legitimate hosts that can be used to discover previously unseen botnet traffic. Moreover, our framework dynamically adapts to changes in network traffic, and is capable of detecting novel botnets without any assumption on their architecture or protocols employed. This is crucial to nullify the constant efforts by botnet managers to adapt to current detection techniques. Through an experimental analysis using the most realistic and varied publicly available botnet dataset, we find that our framework can detect bots in a network with 1.00 TPR and 0.082 FPR or, alternatively, can detect half of the malicious hosts with a FPR as low as 0.0017. These results significantly improve the results reported by similar works in the area, with the added value of not relying on historical botnet data or specific architectures and protocols.}

Four preprocessing techniques and two dynamic selection methods, used on both bagging classifiers and base estimators levels, were considered.

Third-party intrusion is one of the least quantifiable factors being considered during the pipeline hazard assessment stage despite the substantial contributing to the total number of oil and gas pipeline incidents. This is because a probabilistic risk assessment cannot reliably model human actions and be applied to intentional acts. Due to the distinctive motivations of third-party damage, an unintentional third-party damage Bayesian Network model and a game-theoretic model on malicious intrusion will therefore be built, to examine the mechanism of pipeline failure caused by this mode. This study is conducted aiming at investigating pipeline risk resulting from third-party damage, and will formulate risk assessment models to identify threats, prioritize risks and determine which integrity plan should apply to different pipeline segments given the condition of third-party interference (both the accidental damage and malicious acts).}

Recently, Cognitive Radio (CR), a novel technology, has attempted to minimize this problem by dynamically using the free spectrum in wireless communications and mobile computing. Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) can be formed using cognitive radios by extending the radio link features to network layer functions. The objective of CRN architecture is to improve the whole network operation to fulfil the user's demands anytime and anywhere, through accessing CRNs in a more efficient way, rather than by just linking spectral efficiency. CRNs are more flexible and exposed to wireless networks compared with other traditional radio networks. Hence, there are many security threats to CRNs, more so than other traditional radio environments. The unique characteristics of CRNs make security more challenging. Several crucial issues have not yet been investigated in the area of security for CRNs. A typical public key infrastructure (PKI) scheme which achieves secure routing and other purposes in typical ad hoc networks is not enough to guarantee the security of CRNs under limited communication and computation resources. However, there has been increasing research attention on security threats caused specifically by CR techniques and special characteristics of CR in CRNs. Therefore, in this research, a survey of CRNs and their architectures and security issues has been carried out in a broad way in this paper.}

We then analyze the aggregate network footprint of malicious and benign traffic in the cellular network, and demonstrate that statistical network features (e.g., uplink data transfer volume, IP entropy) can be effectively used to distinguish such malicious and benign traffic. We next investigate over 2.4 TB of Wi-Fi traffic data, which are generated by 27 K distinct users, in a university campus network. Based on the lessons learned from a comprehensive exploration of a large feature space consisting of over 500 statistical attributes derived from network traffic to/from malicious and benign domains, we propose a novel, in-house traffic screening method, which has the capability of effectively identifying potential malicious domains.

To guarantee the Gaussianity of the innovations, we use a stochastic rule to transform the threshold detection. We also provide a sufficient condition for the stability of the estimator equipped with the proposed protector under hostile attacks.

The learning and generalization capabilities of the framework also help detect and categorize zero-day attacks. Our prototype helps establish that malicious strains improve their penetration rate through multiple propagation channels as well as compact code footprints; moreover, they attempt to evade detection by resorting to code polymorphism and information encryption.

With respect to the established feature vectors, the APT malware can be detected and clustered into their belonging families accurately. Furthermore, a horizontal comparison between APT malware and the traditional malware is conducted from the perspective of behavior types, to understand the behavioral characteristics of APT malware in depth. On the above basis, the ontology model is introduced to construct the APT malware knowledge framework to represent its typical malicious behaviors, thereby implementing the systematic cognition of APT malware and providing contextual understanding of APT attacks. The evaluation results based on real APT malware samples demonstrate that the detection and clustering accuracy can reach up to 99.28% and 98.85% respectively. In addition, APTMalInsight supplies an effective cognition framework for APT malware and enhances the capability to understand APT attacks.}

abstract = {Today's cyber attacks require a new line of security defenses. The static approach of traditional security based on heuristic and signature does not match the dynamic nature of new generation of threats that are known to be evasive, resilient and complex. Organizations need to gather and share real-time cyber threat information and to transform it to threat intelligence in order to prevent attacks or at least execute timely disaster recovery. Threat Intelligence (TI) means evidence-based knowledge representing threats that can inform decisions. There is a general awareness for the need of threat intelligence while vendors today are rushing to provide a diverse array of threat intelligence products, specifically focusing on Technical Threat Intelligence (TTI). Although threat intelligence is being increasingly adopted, there is little consensus on what it actually is, or how to use it. Without any real understanding of this need, organizations risk investing large amounts of time and money without solving existing security problems. Our paper aims to classify and make distinction among existing threat intelligence types. We focus particularly on the TTI issues, emerging researches, trends and standards. Our paper also explains why there is a reluctance among organizations to share threat intelligence. We provide sharing strategies based on trust and anonymity, so participating organizations can do away with the risks of business leak. We also show in this paper why having a standardized representation of threat information can improve the quality of TTI, thus providing better automated analytics solutions on large volumes of TTI which are often non-uniform and redundant. Finally, we evaluate most popular open source/free threat intelligence tools, and compare their features with those of a new AlliaCERT TI tool.}

Fog computing inherits similar privacy and security concerns present in cloud computing, such as authentication and key management issues. Recently, Wazid et al. presented a scheme of authentication key exchange for fog computing called SAKA-FC to address these issues. We analyzed and identified that the SAKA-FC suffers from some severe vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we presented an improved scheme to mitigate these problems while retaining its strengths. The formal security analysis of the proposed scheme is validated through BAN logic. At the same time, the AVISPA tool is employed for automated formal security verification. Informal security analysis is conducted to attest that the proposal can confront the known attacks. Using computation and communication costs as the metrics, the proposed scheme is also compared with some state-of-the-art schemes. The proposed scheme achieves the same communication cost as of SAKA-FC, whereas the difference in computation cost is 24%. This increase in computation cost is justifiable as the proposal is resistant to clogging attacks and provides better security than the prior schemes.}

abstract = {Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, which are often used in several types of Essential Systems and Critical Infrastructures, depend on control devices such as Programmable Logic Controllers, Remote Terminal Units and Intelligent Electronic Devices. Such devices, which are deployed at the edge of the SCADA infrastructure, directly interface with the physical processes under control. They are often based on embedded systems with limited capabilities and exposed to significant security and safety-related risks, as demonstrated by past incidents such as Stuxnet. However, despite the recognized relevance of those edge devices, they usually lack monitoring mechanisms able to detect device anomalies and/or cyber-physical threats. In this paper we propose a novel approach for stealth monitoring of those control devices, for purposes of security and safety management. This approach builds on cost-effective probes, which we designate as Shadow Security Units (SSU), directly attached to the monitored control devices. This privileged positioning enables the direct and fine-grained observation of both physical inputs/outputs (i.e. the physical processes under control) and network communication flows – allowing the exploitation of various novel monitoring approaches able to address sophisticated security threats not noticeable otherwise. Moreover, the SSU approach is not limited to SCADA scenarios, being also applicable to similar domains such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Avionics and Self-Driving systems.}

abstract = {In this paper, we proposed nested encoder–decoder architecture named T-Net. T-Net consists of several small encoder–decoders for each block constituting convolutional network. T-Net overcomes the limitation that U-Net can only have a single set of the concatenate layer between encoder and decoder block. To be more precise, the U-Net symmetrically forms the concatenate layers, so the low-level feature of the encoder is connected to the latter part of the decoder, and the high-level feature is connected to the beginning of the decoder. T-Net arranges the pooling and up-sampling appropriately during the encoding process, and likewise during the decoding process so that feature-maps of various sizes are obtained in a single block. As a result, all features from the low-level to the high-level extracted from the encoder are delivered from the beginning of the decoder to predict a more accurate mask. We evaluated T-Net for the problem of segmenting three main vessels in coronary angiography images. The experiment consisted of a comparison of U-Net and T-Nets under the same conditions, and an optimized T-Net for the main vessel segmentation. As a result, T-Net recorded a Dice Similarity Coefficient score (DSC) of 83.77%, 10.69% higher than that of U-Net, and the optimized T-Net recorded a DSC of 88.97% which was 15.89% higher than that of U-Net. In addition, we visualized the weight activation of the convolutional layer of T-Net and U-Net to show that T-Net actually predicts the mask from earlier decoders. Therefore, we expect that T-Net can be effectively applied to other similar medical image segmentation problems.}

However, many studies have revealed that hackers can circumvent BDD and inserted false data into the power systems estimated state.

abstract = {The rapid detection of attackers within firewalls of enterprise computer networks is of paramount importance. Anomaly detectors address this problem by quantifying deviations from baseline statistical models of normal network behavior and signaling an intrusion when the observed data deviates significantly from the baseline model. However, many anomaly detectors do not take into account plausible attacker behavior. As a result, anomaly detectors are prone to a large number of false positives due to unusual but benign activity. This paper first introduces a stochastic model of attacker behavior which is motivated by real world attacker traversal. Then, we develop a likelihood ratio detector that compares the probability of observed network behavior under normal conditions against the case when an attacker has possibly compromised a subset of hosts within the network. Since the likelihood ratio detector requires integrating over the time each host becomes compromised, we illustrate how to use Monte Carlo methods to compute the requisite integral. We then present Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for various network parameterizations that show for any rate of true positives, the rate of false positives for the likelihood ratio detector is no higher than that of a simple anomaly detector and is often lower. We conclude by demonstrating the superiority of the proposed likelihood ratio detector when the network topologies and parameterizations are extracted from real-world networks.}

The pervasiveness, miniaturisations and declining costs of Internet connectivity have transformed these systems from strictly isolated to highly interconnected networks. The connectivity provides immense benefits such as reliability, scalability and remote connectivity, but at the same time exposes an otherwise isolated and secure system, to global cyber security threats. This inevitable transformation to highly connected systems thus necessitates effective security safeguards to be in place as any compromise or downtime of SCADA systems can have severe economic, safety and security ramifications. One way to ensure vital asset protection is to adopt a viewpoint similar to an attacker to determine weaknesses and loopholes in defences. Such mind sets help to identify and fix potential breaches before their exploitation. This paper surveys tools and techniques to uncover SCADA system vulnerabilities. A comprehensive review of the selected approaches is provided along with their applicability.}

In Smart Grid, smart meters thwart electricity theft in some ways but cause more problems, e.g., intrusions, hacking, and malicious manipulation. Various detectors have been proposed to detect NTL frauds, but they either rely on user behavior analysis which requires a large amount of historical data or needs a lot of extra devices which are expensive. In this paper, a detector named NFD (NTL Fraud Detection), is proposed to detect NTL frauds with only a small amount of data and one additional device. NFD is based on Lagrange polynomial interpolation to model an adversary's behaviors, and detect a tampered meter by comparing the difference between the results. Different from existing detectors, our detector knows adversaries better than adversaries themselves. By building mathematical models of these adversaries, we can predict their behaviors which they may not be aware of by themselves. NFD makes it practical to detect NTL frauds both online and offline in Smart Grid. NFD can facilitate real-world applications before Smart Grid is fully deployed since it can serve the traditional power grid and Smart Grid simultaneously. Experimental results show the effectiveness of NFD. It can detect multiple tampered meters and multiple adversaries, as well as a single tampered meter and a single adversary. We also study how to tune the parameters used in NFD to further guide its practical usage.}

To defeat, we propose Graph Mining for Metamorphic Malware Detection (G3MD), an intelligent system for static detection of metamorphic malwares. G3MD demonstrates one of the many aspects of what the current generation of machine-learning techniques and expert systems can do. It extends what is known about practical application of machine-learning techniques in the field of information security. It is intended to alleviate the burden of human experts and underlying costs. The novelty of G3MD is to apply graph mining on the opcode graphs of a metamorphic family of malwares to extract the frequent sub-graphs, so called micro-signatures. Based on these sub-graphs, a classifier is trained to distinguish between a benign file and a metamorphic malware. We conducted experiments on four families of metamorphic malwares common in previous studies, namely Next Generation Virus Generation Kit (NGVCK), Second Generation Virus Generator (G2), and Mass Produced Code Generation Kit (MPCGEN) viruses and Metamorphic Worm (MWOR) worms. The precision (over 99% in most cases) of metamorphic malware detection by the proposed approach corroborates its effectiveness over other existing approaches.}

To consider “role-shifting” in the practical network attack and defense environment, the proposed approach substitutes solving the Nash equilibrium (NE) problem with a payoff (reward) maximization problem via a profound combination between the subgame perfect NE of the complete information dynamic game and the BNE of the incomplete information static game. Furthermore, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a representative signaling game with specific values is examined from a theoretical perspective. Finally, a real penetration test case targeting a web server is implemented to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed approach from a practical perspective with some visual verifications and crucial penetration codes, where the attacker successfully obtains the ROOT authority (the highest authority) of the target web server.}

Deployment of the Control Flow Integrity(CFI) checks limit the control flow of a program to a set of valid destinations, derived from the static analysis of the code. CFI checks guarantee the integrity of the executed code, but, they do not guarantee the integrity of execution, as sophisticated attack vectors create attacks that comply with the normal control flow of the program. This paper proposes an application specific, dynamic, execution integrity verification scheme, to detect static and dynamic integrity breaches. The system builds a behaviour model consisting of function call sequences and memory access graphs, to verify the semantic behaviour exhibited by the application. Dynamic variation of the function behaviour is further recorded as Access Graph Variance Vector (AGVV). Temporal sequencing of function calls, together with the memory access graph comparison, yields a two-level integrity verification system. Apart from detecting the deviations from normal behaviour, our proposed method limits the abnormal behaviour from being propagated. Experimental evaluation of the proposed method using applications from MiBench benchmark suite against static integrity breaches shows cent percent verification accuracy with less than 5% false positive rate. The system also identifies the dynamic integrity violation caused by ROP based attacks from the RIPE benchmark suite, indicating an accuracy of 94.44% against dynamic integrity breaches.}

Non-technical losses occurring in the electric grid at level of transmission or of distribution have negative impact on economies, affecting utilities, paying consumers and states. The paper is concerned with the lines of research pursued, the main techniques used and the limitations on current solutions. Also, a typology for the categorization of solutions for detection of non-technical losses is proposed and the sources and possible attack/vulnerability points are identified. The selected literature covers a wide range of solutions associated with non-technical losses. Of the 103 selected studies, 6 are theoretical, 25 propose hardware solutions and 72 propose non-hardware solutions. Data based classification models and data from consumption with high resolution are respectively required in about 47% and 35% of the reported solutions. Available solutions cover a wide range of cases, with the main limitation found being the lack of an unified solution, which enables the detection of all kinds of non-technical losses.}

PROOFS creates and stores signatures for files that are deleted, edited, or copied within such a network. The heart of each signature is one or more fingerprints, generated based on statistical properties of file contents, maintaining semantics while requiring as little as 1.06% of the storage space of the original file. We focus on text documents and show that PROOFS has a high precision of 0.96 and recall of 0.85 with stored fingerprint sizes of less than 375 bytes. The two contributions of this work are that we show that common environments exist where proactive collection of forensic evidence is possible and that we demonstrate an efficient and accurate mechanism for collecting evidence in those environments.}

In contrast to current signature-based security methods, our solution is an ontology based technique. It specifies web application attacks by using semantic rules, the context of consequence and the specifications of application protocols. The system is capable of detecting sophisticated attacks effectively and efficiently by analyzing the specified portion of a user request where attacks are possible. Semantic rules help to capture the context of the application, possible attacks and the protocol that was used. These rules also allow inference to run over the ontological models in order to detect, the often complex polymorphic variations of web application attacks. The ontological model was developed using Description Logic that was based on the Web Ontology Language (OWL). The inference rules are Horn Logic statements and are implemented using the Apache JENA framework. The system is therefore platform and technology independent. Prior to the evaluation of the system the knowledge model was validated by using OntoClean to remove inconsistency, incompleteness and redundancy in the specification of ontological concepts. The experimental results show that the detection capability and performance of our system is significantly better than existing state of the art solutions. The system successfully detects web application attacks whilst generating few false positives. The examples that are presented demonstrate that a semantic approach can be used to effectively detect zero day and more sophisticated attacks in a real-world environment.}

The second form of training, which used to attract less attention, aims at increasing cyber security awareness among non-security professionals and the general public. Conducting such training programs requires dedicated testbeds and infrastructures that help realizing and executing the training scenarios and provide a playground for the trainees. A cyber range is an environment that aims at providing such testbeds.

Unsurprisingly, serious privacy and security risks emerged, positioning themselves along two main types of attacks: attacks that exploit the implicit trust embedded in declared social relationships; and attacks that harvest user’s personal information for ill-intended use.

There are vulnerabilities in 6LoWPAN and associated routing protocol, which open up new spoofing paths to the attacker. This study aims at profiling the feasibility to carry IPv6 spoofing attack on the 6LoWPAN network. Two new different attack paths are identified, which associate wrong IPv6 address with the MAC address of a node. These two paths use spoofed RPL and 6LoWPAN-ND messages to perform the IPv6 spoofing attack in an unsecured wireless medium. Probability of attack success is analyzed using the radio propagation environment parameters which affect the correct reception of a signal. It is shown that the success of an attack is highly dependent on the signal path loss. To perform the systematic mathematical analysis, attack tree model is used and attack is simulated in cooja simulator as well as performed in real experimental network. Our mathematical and simulated analysis show that path loss exponent, which represents distance based path loss, affects the probability of attack success. Attack feasibility analysis is done to find the cost to the attacker with respect to energy and memory consumption. It is observed that attacker code can be accommodated in memory constrained devices, and uses less energy to perform the attack, which manifests its feasibility.}

To achieve a seamless integration, various design and implementation issues related to 5G and VANETs must be addressed. We focus on the security issues that need to be considered in order to enable the secure integration of 5G and VANETs. More precisely, we conduct in-depth study of the current security issues, solutions, and standards used in vehicular networks and then we identify the security gaps in the existing VANET security solutions. We investigate the security features of 5G networks and discuss how they can be leveraged in vehicular networks to enable a seamless and efficient integration. We also propose a security architecture for vehicular networks wherein the current VANET security standards and 5G security features coexist to support secure VANET applications. Finally, we discuss some future challenges and research directions for 5G-enabled secure vehicular networks.}

Our approach is based on two notions derived from database theory, namely k-anonymity and t-closeness. They are applied to cluster the involved objects in order to provide a unitary view of them and of their features. Indeed, the use of k-anonymity and t-closeness makes derived groups robust from a privacy perspective. In this way, not only information disclosure, but also feature disclosure, is prevented. This is an important strength of our approach because the malicious analysis of objects’ features can have disruptive effects on the privacy (and, ultimately, on the life) of people.}

Although smart meters are equipped with encrypted communication and tamper-detection features, they are likely to be exposed to multiple cyber attacks. These meters may be easily compromised to falsify meter readings, which increases the chances and diversifies the types of energy theft. To thwart energy fraud from smart meters, utility providers are identifying anomalous consumption patterns reported to operation centers by leveraging on consumers’ consumption data collected from advanced metering infrastructure. In this paper, we put forward a new anomaly detection framework to evaluate consumers’ energy utilization behavior for identifying the localities of potential energy frauds and faulty meters. Metrics known as the loss factor and error term are introduced to estimate the amount of technical losses and capture the measurement noise, respectively in the distribution lines and transformers. The anomaly detection framework is then enhanced to detect consumers’ malfeasance and faulty meters even when there are intermittent cheating and faulty equipment, improving its robustness. Results from both simulations and test rig show that the proposed framework can successfully locate fraudulent consumers and discover faulty smart meters.}

Through the collaboration of agents at all levels, the MHDM scheme can identify the operation state of the power system, and mitigate the impact of cyber attacks while distinguishing them from physical faults.

However, a mechanism to guarantee the correct adaptation of the functionality that enforces the changing security policies is needed.

Given the growing literature on technology applications in safety management and the varying opinions on the utility of applied technologies, a systematic review that streamlines findings from past studies is indispensable to construction stakeholders. Although a number of review studies are available in the building construction sector, the level of fragmentation and uniqueness within the construction industry necessitates a review study specifically targeting the heavy civil sector. In response, the present study applies a three-step approach to identify and review articles pertinent to the safety of highway construction work zones. The factors considered include the number of publications per year, publication locations, and technology types. In addition, the present study proposes to broadly group work zone safety technologies (WZSTs) into three categories based on their primary purpose: speed reduction systems, intrusion prevention and warning systems, and human-machine-interaction detection systems. Key findings include WZST research trends, application of smart work zone systems, and the potential relationship between WZSTs and fatalities. The paper ends with the identification of six additional research areas aimed at deepening the understanding of technology's role in highway safety management. The trend analysis and an in-depth discussion of each technology category alongside the identified research gaps will provide a substantial informative body of knowledge that both benefits current practitioners and directs researchers towards potential future studies.}

abstract = {A variety of modern Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are distributed and asynchronous systems that are becoming the backbone for smart infrastructures and systems such as smart grids, power plants, medical appliances, social robots etc. The weaving of cyber components with the physical system improves resource utilization and system reliability. However, it makes the CPSs significantly vulnerable to several cyber threats by increasing the attack surfaces. In safety-critical cyber-physical systems, the primary focus is on safety assurance. Any mistake or ignorance in security analysis may greatly amplify the losses in the presence of cyber threats. Such security failure may result in severe damages that may range from affecting critical infrastructures up to even loss of human lives. Thus, an early-staged security modeling of these systems is a prominent issue and requires a systematic approach for modeling a secure design as well as performance evaluation of alternative designs for the same. An in-depth security analysis involves the identification of a standard set of evaluation metrics. The proposed work provides the design-time methodology to map and analyze system security qualitatively and quantitatively using Stochastic Petri nets and their fundamental properties. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is evaluated using a Nuclear power plant (NPP) case study.}

Such networks comprise many computers with Internet connectivity, and many users who access the Web and utilise Cloud services make use of numerous devices connected to the network on an ad-hoc basis. Measuring the risk of cyber attacks and identifying the most recent modus-operandi of cyber criminals on large computer networks can be difficult due to the wide range of services and applications running within the network, the multiple vulnerabilities associated with each application, the severity associated with each vulnerability, and the ever-changing attack vector of cyber criminals. In this paper we propose a framework to represent these features, enabling real-time network enumeration and traffic analysis to be carried out, in order to produce quantified measures of risk at specific points in time. We validate the approach using data from a University network, with a data collection consisting of 462,787 instances representing threats measured over a 144 hour period. Our analysis can be generalised to a variety of other contexts.}

Traditional security tools and mechanisms are unable to effectively and continuously track changes in cloud infrastructure owing to transience and unpredictability of cloud events. Therefore, novel tools that are proactive, agile and continuous are imperative. This article proposes CSBAuditor, a novel cloud security system that continuously monitors cloud infrastructure, to detect malicious activities and unauthorized changes. CSBAuditor leverages two concepts: state transition analysis and reconciler pattern to overcome the aforementioned security issues. Furthermore, security metrics are used to compute severity scores for detected vulnerabilities using a novel scoring system: Cloud Security Scoring System. CSBAuditor has been evaluated using various strategies including security chaos engineering (fault injection) strategies on Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. CSBAuditor effectively detects misconfigurations in real-time with a detection rate of over 98%. Also, the performance overhead is within acceptable limits.}

A novel adaptive real time change-point model that tracks the changes in Mahalanobis distances between sampled feature vectors in the monitored system accounts for possible DDoS attacks. A clustering model that runs over the similarity scores of behavioral patterns between the users is used to segregate the malicious from the innocent. The proposed model is deployed over a simulated telephone network that uses a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server.

We first provide the formal definitions of the combination to design and implement our proposal. Then, we investigate a number of approaches in which Shuffle and Diversity can be combined in order to provide the most effective defense. Towards, we utilize Network Centrality Measures (NCMs) to find out the most critical component in the cloud. Then, we evaluate the proposed MTD techniques through formal Graphical Security Models (GSM) and quantify the cloud security level through security metrics before and after deploying the MTD techniques. Our experimental evaluation shows that the combination of Shuffle and Diversity techniques can increase the security posture of the cloud.}

Two of the most important challenges to be addressed concern the protection of smart objects and the need to guarantee them a great autonomy. For this purpose, the definition of trust and reputation mechanisms appears crucial. At the same time, several researchers have started to adopt a common distributed ledger, such as a Blockchain, for building advanced solutions in the IoT. However, due to the high dimensionality of this problem, enabling a trust and reputation mechanism by leveraging a Blockchain-based technology could give rise to several performance issues in the IoT. In this paper, we propose a two-tier Blockchain framework to increase the security and autonomy of smart objects in the IoT by implementing a trust-based protection mechanism. In this framework, smart objects are suitably grouped into communities. To reduce the complexity of the solution, the first-tier Blockchain is local and is used only to record probing transactions performed to evaluate the trust of an object in another one of the same community or of a different community. Periodically, after a time window, these transactions are aggregated and the obtained values are stored in the second-tier Blockchain. Specifically, stored values are the reputation of each object inside its community and the trust of each community in the other ones of the framework. In this paper, we describe in detail our framework, its behavior, the security model associated with it and the tests carried out to evaluate its correctness and performance.}

To study the relationship between artificial and real deception, this paper presents an experimental comparison using a novel deception generation model. The deception and truth data were collected from financial aid applications, a document centric area with limited resources for verification. The data collection provided a unique data set containing truth, natural deception, and boosted deception. To simulate deception, the Application Deception Model was developed to generate artificial deception in different deception scenarios. To study differences between artificial and real deception, an experiment was performed using deception level and data generation method as factors and directed distance and outlier score as outcome variables. Our results provided evidence of a reasonable similarity between artificial and real deception, suggesting the possibility of using artificially generated deception to reduce the costs associated with obtaining training data.}

Addressing these problems, we propose a high-level system architecture and a security protocol specifically designed for congestion detection based on vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) type communication. The security properties of our proposed approach are formally verified using the ProVerif tool, and its efficiency compared to the traditional traffic light systems is demonstrated through simulations with the Veins framework. Results show that our system is secure against a large set of attacks, and can have lower total travelling time compared to three traditional traffic light approaches based on induction loop, lane area detector/camera (installed near the junctions), and static lights.}

The derived fingerprints have strong privacy implications such as de-anonymizing the DNS traces and tracking users’ locations across different networks. We have proposed a set of new patterns, which collectively form behavioral fingerprints by characterizing a user’s DNS activities through three different perspectives including the domain name, the inter-domain relationship, and domains’ temporal behavior. We have performed extensive evaluation based on a large volume of DNS queries collected from a large campus network across three weeks. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed DNS-based fingerprints can accomplish high accuracy on revealing network users’ presence in a new DNS stream based on their fingerprint patterns derived from a historical DNS stream. We also experimentally explored the correlation between users’ general network activities and their DNS-based fingerprints.}

abstract = {Modern social worms have been evolving from mass propagation (i.e., blind social worm) to targeted intrusion with the purpose of advanced persistent threats (or APT in short), which concern more on attacking a small number of selected social targets with stealthy propagation (to avoid early exposure caused by a large population of infections), usually at the cost of slow infection speed and thus suffering a long-term propagation period. The resulted propagation characteristics are therefore very different compared to mass infections and cannot be well captured by existing propagation models. In this paper, we take the first step to model social worm propagation for the APT using a novel proactive give-up factor, by which the worm can consult to actively postpone or stop unnecessary infections in order to keep the propagation stealthy (inversely in terms of the size of infected population) and long-term (in terms of the number of infection time epochs), meanwhile maintaining the reachability to the targets (in terms of the connectivity from sources to targets). Our basic idea is to derive such a factor for each node as a give-up probability or a delayed value according to the node’s relative location with respect to sources and targets. We note new infections may lead the relative locations for each node vary, and accordingly model the factor updating upon the propagation progress. To validate our design, we have conducted rigorous theoretical analysis, as well as extensive experiments by running simulated APT worms over the real-world social network topologies. The results have successfully confirmed the effectiveness of our model in simulating APT worm’s propagation with targeted, stealthy and long-term properties altogether.}

The consistency of network risk ratings and rankings were evaluated for each of the 16 network topologies across a sample of 55 network security professionals who reviewed these topologies. Three robust significant main effects (network partitioning, wireless status, and connectivity) and one significant interaction (network partitioning X wireless status) were found. While some topologies were consistently rated and ranked as significantly more risky than others, there was some variability in ratings at each main effect level as well as the spread of the mean ratings between the two main effect levels (e.g., wireless and wired). We discuss the implications of our findings with respect to network risk metric rigor.}

To organize the literature on the applications of data mining in accounting, we create a framework that combines the two well-known accounting reporting perspectives (retrospection and prospection), and the three well-accepted goals of data mining (description, prediction, and prescription). The framework encapsulates a taxonomy of four categories (retrospective-descriptive, retrospective-prescriptive, prospective-prescriptive, and prospective-predictive) of data mining applications in accounting. The proposed framework revealed that the area of accounting that benefited the most from data mining is assurance and compliance, including fraud detection, business health and forensic accounting. The clear gaps seem to be in the two prescriptive application categories (retrospective-prescriptive and prospective-prescriptive), indicating opportunities for benefiting from data mining in these application categories. The framework presents a holistic view of the literature and systematically organizes it in a structurally logical and thematically coherent manner.}

However, the unique characteristics of MANETs have imposed great challenges in designing a fully distributed public key management protocol under resource-constrained MANET environments. These challenges include no centralized trusted entities, resource constraints, and high security vulnerabilities. This work proposes a fully distributed trust-based public key management approach for MANETs using a soft security mechanism based on the concept of trust. Instead of using hard security approaches, as in traditional security techniques, to eliminate security vulnerabilities, our work aims to maximize performance by relaxing security requirements based on the perceived trust. We propose a composite trust-based public key management (CTPKM) with the goal of maximizing performance while mitigating security vulnerability. Each node employs a trust threshold to determine whether or not to trust another node. Our simulation results show that an optimal trust threshold exists to best balance and meet the conflicting goals between performance and security, by exploiting the inherent tradeoff between trust and risk. The results also show that CTPKM minimizes risk (i.e., information leakout) using an optimal trust threshold while maximizing service availability with acceptable communication overhead incurred by trust and key management operations. We demonstrate that CTPKM outperforms both existing non-trust-based and trust-based counterparts.}

We consider the well-known model of a shared memory switch with bounded-size buffer and generalize it in two directions. First, we consider unit-sized packets labeled with an output port and a processing requirement (i.e., packets with heterogeneous processing), maximizing the number of transmitted packets. We analyze the performance of buffer management policies under various characteristics via competitive analysis that provides uniform guarantees across traffic patterns (Borodin and ElYaniv 1998). We propose the Longest-Work-Drop policy and show that it is at most 2-competitive and at least 2-competitive. Second, we consider another generalization, posed as an open problem in Goldwasser (2010), where each unit-sized packet is labeled with an output port and intrinsic value, and the goal is to maximize the total value of transmitted packets. We show first results in this direction and define a scheduling policy that, as we conjecture, may achieve constant competitive ratio. We also present a comprehensive simulation study that validates our results.}

abstract = {This paper presents a new vulnerability assessment model based on timing attacks. In particular, it examines the problem where an adversary has access to a certain sensor reading or a controller output signal in real time, but can only cause denial of service (DoS). Jamming the communications to a device can cause the system to work with stale data that, in turn, could interfere with the control algorithm to the extent of driving the system to an undesirable state. If the DoS attack is not timed properly, the use of stale data by the controller or actuator would have a limited impact on the process. However, if the attacker is able to launch the DoS attack at the correct time, the use of stale data can drive the system to an unsafe state. This paper uses the Tennessee Eastman challenge process to investigate the problem of an attacker who has to identify (in real time) the optimal moment to launch a DoS attack. The results suggest that, by attacking sensor and controller signals, the attacker can manipulate the process at will, but the success of the attack depends considerably on the specific stale values due to the dynamic nature of the process. The choice of time to begin an attack is forward-looking, requiring the attacker to consider each current opportunity against the possibility of a better opportunity in the future; this lends itself to the theory of optimal stopping problems. In particular, this paper studies the applicability of the Best Choice Problem (also known as the Secretary Problem), quickest change detection and statistical process outliers. The analysis can be used to identify specific sensor measurements that need to be protected and the time-to-response necessary to enable process operators and asset owners to define appropriate attack response strategies.}

Although a large variety of tools and techniques are available for vulnerability analysis, the majority work at system or network level without explicit association with human and organizational factors. This article presents a middleware approach to bridge the gap between system-level vulnerabilities and organization-level security metrics, ultimately contributing to cost-benefit security hardening. In particular, our approach systematically integrates attack graph, a commonly used effective approach to representing and analyzing network vulnerabilities, and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) together, for exploring the probabilistic relation between system observations and states. More specifically, we modify and apply dependency attack graph to represent network assets and vulnerabilities (observations), which are then fed to HMM for estimating attack states, whereas their transitions are driven by a set of predefined cost factors associated with potential attacks and countermeasures. A heuristic searching algorithm is employed to automatically infer the optimal security hardening through cost-benefit analysis. We use a synthetic network scenario to illustrate our approach and evaluate its performance through a set of simulations.}

The impact of metamorphism is growing in security and code protection technologies, both for preventing malicious host attacks, e.g., in software diversification for IP and integrity protection, and in malicious software attacks, e.g., in metamorphic malware self-modifying their own code in order to foil detection systems based on signature matching. In this paper we consider the problem of automatically extracting metamorphic signatures from metamorphic code. We introduce a semantics for self-modifying code, later called phase semantics, and prove its correctness by showing that it is an abstract interpretation of the standard trace semantics. Phase semantics precisely models the metamorphic code behavior by providing a set of traces of programs which correspond to the possible evolutions of the metamorphic code during execution. We show that metamorphic signatures can be automatically extracted by abstract interpretation of the phase semantics. In particular, we introduce the notion of regular metamorphism, where the invariants of the phase semantics can be modeled as finite state automata representing the code structure of all possible metamorphic change of a metamorphic code, and we provide a static signature extraction algorithm for metamorphic code where metamorphic signatures are approximated in regular metamorphism.}

abstract = {A Non-Technical Loss (NTL) fraud occurs when a fraudster tampers with a smart meter so that the meter registers less electricity consumption than the actual consumed amount, and therefore the utility becomes the victim who suffers the corresponding economic loss. In the literature, many detection schemes have been proposed to detect NTL frauds. However, some NTL frauds are far more complicated than what the existing schemes expect. We recently discovered a new potential type of frauds, a variant of NTL frauds, called Colluded Non-Technical Loss (CNTL) frauds in the Smart Grid. In a CNTL fraud, multiple fraudsters can co-exist or collaborate to commit the fraud. Existing detection schemes cannot detect CNTL frauds since these methods do not consider the co-existing or collaborating fraudsters, and therefore cannot distinguish one from many fraudsters. In this paper, we propose a CNTL fraud detector to detect CNTL frauds. The proposed method can quickly detect a tampered meter based on recursive least squares. After identifying the tampered meter, the proposed scheme can detect different fraudsters using mathematical models. Our experiments show that our method is effective in detecting CNTL frauds.}

abstract = {Cloud computing offers various services to users by re-arranging storage and computing resources. In order to preserve data privacy, cloud users may choose to upload encrypted data rather than raw data to the cloud. However, processing and analyzing encrypted data are challenging problems, which have received increasing attention in recent years. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) was proposed to support computation on encrypted data and ensure data confidentiality simultaneously. However, a limitation of HE is it is a single user system, which means it only allows the party that owns a homomorphic decryption key to decrypt processed ciphertexts. Original HE cannot support multiple users to access the processed ciphertexts flexibly. In this paper, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Data Processing (PPDP) system with the support of a Homomorphic Re-Encryption Scheme (HRES). The HRES extends partial HE from a single-user system to a multi-user one by offering ciphertext re-encryption to allow multiple users to access processed ciphertexts. Through the cooperation of a Data Service Provider (DSP) and an Access Control Server (ACS), the PPDP system can support seven basic operations over ciphertexts, which include Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Sign Acquisition, Comparison, Equivalent Test, and Variance. To enhance the flexibility and security of our system, we further apply multiple ACSs to take in charge of the data from their own users and design computing operations over ciphertexts belonging to multiple ACSs. We then prove the security of PPDP, analyze its performance and advantages by comparing with some latest work, and demonstrate its efficiency and effectiveness through simulations with regard to big data process.}

These attacks are targeted and are commonly referred as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). The currently available techniques to tackle these attacks are mostly reactive and signature based. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), a proactive approach is the best solution. However, the major problem with SIEM is tackling huge amount of data in real time that makes it a time consuming and tedious task for security analyst. The use of threat intelligence caters to such issue by prioritizing the level of threat. In this paper, we assign risk score and confidence value to each feed generated at our product “T-Eye platform”. On the basis of these values, we assign a severity score to each feed type. Severity score assigns a level to the threat means prioritize the threat. The results, we achieved for prioritizing the threat is more apparent and accurate. In addition, we optimize the rules of IBM-Q-Radar by using threat feeds generated at T-Eye platform. Furthermore, a huge amount of false positive alarms generated at IBM Q-Radar is reduced to a certain extent.}

The increase in number of connected devices makes the network vulnerable to various threats.

In this paper a three layer framework for IoT environment is designed where the users of first layer are intended to collect data from the sensor nodes of third layer through the fog devices that are belongs to second layer. The resource constraint sensor nodes are released from checking the authenticity of users to save their energy. Thus some high capacity nodes, called fog devices, are involved to check the authentication of users. The users are categorized as high, medium or low trusted by using fuzzy logic. Further it delves for the authentication of low and medium trusted user by implementing a lightweight two phase authentication scheme. Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is used to generate unique identity for individual users and to create Challenge Response Pairs (CRPs). The performance is evaluated by using Raspberry Pi as a user and a laptop as a fog device. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing schemes in terms of average response time, handshake duration, memory utilization and communication cost. Moreover this scheme is resilience against replay attack, DoS attack, false data injection and man in the middle attack.}

The integration of sensors, lightweight computation, and the proliferation of different wireless technologies on IoT platforms enable human beings to easily interact with their surrounding physical world thoroughly. With the recent rise of IoT, several different IoT platforms have been introduced for researchers and developers to ease the management and control of various IoT devices. In general, the IoT platforms act as a bridge between core IoT functionalities and users by providing APIs. Due to their wide variety of applications, IoT platforms are mostly unique in their architectures and designs. Thus, IoT administrators, developers, and researchers (i.e., IoT users) are challenged with substantial configuration differences in the proper configuration, implementation, and protection of the IoT solutions. In this survey, we conduct an in-depth analysis of popular IoT platforms from different application domains. More specifically, we define a comprehensive evaluation framework that considers seven different technical comparison criteria: (1) topology design, (2) programming languages, (3) third-party support, (4) extended protocol support, (5) event handling, (6) security, and (7) privacy. Then, we use the framework to evaluate the different IoT platforms highlighting their distinguishing attributes on communications, security, and privacy. First, we describe the communication protocols supported by the different IoT platforms surveyed. Then, rather than uncovering novel threats affecting IoT, we aim to analyze how the different IoT platforms handle security and privacy vulnerabilities affecting the most common security services of confidentiality, integrity, availability, and access control. Further, we present possible solutions that these platforms could implement to strengthen security and privacy within the IoT solution. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of every IoT platform, so IoT administrators, developers, and researchers (i.e., IoT users) can make an informed decision on the use of specific platforms to implement their IoT solutions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey to evaluate different IoT platforms using the criteria defined in this work.}

Although there are principles and rules, there is still a lack of methodologies to guide the integration of privacy guidelines into the development process. Methodologies like the Privacy by Design (PbD) are still vague and leave many open questions on how to apply them in practice. In this work we propose a new concept, called Privacy by Evidence (PbE), in the form of a software development methodology to provide privacy-awareness. Given the difficulty in providing total privacy in many applications, we propose to document the mitigations in form of evidences of privacy, aiming to increase the confidence of the project. To validate its effectiveness, PbE has been used during the development of four case studies: a smart metering application; a people counting and monitoring application; an energy efficiency monitoring system; and a two factor authentication system. For these applications, the teams were able to provide seven, five, five, and four evidences of privacy, respectively, and we conclude that PbE can be effective in helping to understand and address the privacy protection needs when developing software.}

In spite of many advantages, SDN based data centers’ security issues is still a matter of concern among the research communities. Although SDN becomes a valuable tool to defeat attackers, at the same time SDN itself becomes a victim of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks due to the potential vulnerabilities exist across various SDN layer. The logically centralized controller is always an attractive target for DDoS attack. Hence, it is important to have a fast as well as accurate detection model to detect the control layer attack traffic at an early stage. We have employed information distance (ID) as a metric to detect the attack traffic at the controller. The ID metric can quantify the deviations of network traffic with different probability distributions. In this paper, taking the advantages of flow based nature of SDN, we proposed a Generalized Entropy (GE) based metric to detect the low rate DDoS attack to the control layer. The experimental results show that our detection mechanism improves the detection accuracy as compared to Shannon entropy and other statistical information distance metrics.}

abstract = {Achieving security in distributed systems of constrained devices (like Wireless Sensor Networks) requires methods that can be performed while very limited computational, memory and communication resources are available. Moreover, while designing security protocols one needs take into account the adversary that can eavesdrop communication or compromise some of the devices. To achieve some level of security, two communicating devices need to establish a communication key. In the setting of severely constrained devices traditional methods are infeasible due to resource limitations, and one has to incorporate other security providing methods. One of the first such protocols has been introduced in  Eschenauer and Gligor [23]. The paper followed by dozens of others relies on probabilistic key sharing among the nodes before deployment (key predistribution) in the Ad Hoc environment. In our paper, we show that regular protocols of key predistribution designed primarily for providing confidentiality of communication do not provide privacy in many natural scenarios. More precisely, even a weak adversary may “link” transmissions of the same nodes. In particular even a passive adversary that is eavesdropping the communication can easily recognize whether the same devices start communication several times. Such information not only breaches nodes’ privacy but also can be a starting point for an more advanced attacks and can give significant information about network’s activity. We define several models of adversary and introduce some general methods that can be used for addressing this issue. For the model with weaker adversary we show how to fully secure the privacy in an efficient manner. For the case of stronger adversary, we propose a method based on local key exchange allowing mitigation of the privacy threat.}

abstract = {Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) often suffer from intermittent disruption due to factors such as mobility and energy. Though lots of routing algorithms in DTNs have been proposed in the last few years, the routing security problems have not attracted enough attention. DTNs are still facing the threats from different kinds of routing attacks. In this paper, a general purpose defense mechanism is proposed against various routing attacks on DTNs. The defense mechanism is based on the routing path information acquired from the forwarded messages and the acknowledgment (ACK), and it is suitable for different routing schemes. Evolutionary game theory is applied with the defense mechanism to analyze and facilitate the strategy changes of the nodes in the networks. Simulation results show that the proposed evolutionary game theory based defense scheme can achieve high average delivery ratio, low network overhead and low average transmission delay in various routing attack scenarios. By introducing the game theory, the networks can avoid being attacked and provide normal transmission service. The networks can reach evolutionary strategy stable (ESS) under special conditions after evolution. The initial parameters will affect the convergence speed and the final ESS, but the initial ratio of the nodes choosing different strategies can only affect the game process.}

In this article, we use GPS data from taxis to monitor the emergence of unexpected behavior in the Beijing metropolitan area, which has the potential to estimate and improve traffic conditions in advance. We adapt likelihood ratio test statistic (LRT) which have previously been mostly used in epidemiological studies to describe traffic patterns. To the best of our knowledge the use of LRT in traffic domain is not only novel but results in accurate and rapid detection of anomalous behavior.}

abstract = {With increased adoption of digital systems for instrumentation and control, nuclear power plants have become more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Such attacks can have very serious implications on a plant's operation, especially if they masquerade as safety events. Thus, it is important that research be focused towards distinguishing cyber-attacks from fault induced safety events for a correct response in a timely manner. In this paper, an event classifier is presented to classify abnormal events in nuclear power plants as either fault induced safety events or cyber-attacks. The process of inferring the hidden (unobservable) state of a system (normal or faulty) through observable physical sensor measurements has been a long-standing industry practice. There has been a recent surge of literature discussing the use of network traffic data for the detection of cyber-attacks on industrial control systems. In the classifier we present, both physical and network behaviors of a nuclear power plant during abnormal events (safety events or cyber-attacks) are used to infer the probabilities of the states of the plant. The nature of the abnormal event in question is then determined based on these probabilities. The Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) methodology is used for this purpose since it is an appropriate framework for inferring hidden states of a system from observed variables through probabilistic reasoning. In this paper we introduce a DBN based abnormal event classifier and an architecture to implement this classifier as part of a monitoring system. An experimental environment is setup with a two-tank system in conjunction with a nuclear power plant simulator and a programmable logic controller. A set of 27 cyber-attacks and 14 safety events were systematically designed for the experiment. A set of 6 cyber-attacks and 2 safety events were used to manually finetune the Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) of the 2-timeslice dynamic Bayesian network (2T-DBN). Out of the remaining 33 events, the nature of the abnormal event was successfully identified in all the 33 cases and the location of the cyber-attack or fault was successfully determined in 32 cases. The case-study demonstrates the applicability of the methodology developed. Further research should examine the practicality of implementing the proposed monitoring system on a real-world system and issues associated with cost optimization.}

Central authority controlling the system formulates the policy about which fog device will get data from which IoT device/s. As fog devices have attributes like physical location, storage capacity, computing capability etc, attribute based access policy can be enforced on each IoT data. Ciphertext Policy – Attribute Based Encryption (CP-ABE) is a method to implement the access policies. However, number of access trees becomes equal to the number of access policies. In this paper, hierarchy present in attribute sets of access policies has been exploited to obtain single integrated access policy. A content sharing protocol named Hierarchical Efficient Encryption at Edge (HE3) is worked out to implement the concept. The proposed protocol is demonstrated to be highly efficient in terms of encryption and decryption time as compared to existing approaches. A formal security proof is provided to establish strength of encryption.}

Intelligent transportation system involves a huge amount of dynamic real-time critical data so its security is a major concern. Different security aspects of IoV are studied in this review which includes security requirements, security challenges, and security attacks. After this, existing security solutions of all attacks are elaborated and discussion section is provided to highlight the drawbacks of security solutions deployed for each attack as well as it emphasizes on the attacks for which no security solutions are available. Based on the extensive study conducted on this, it has been found that existing security solutions use conventional cryptographic techniques that affect the performance of the delay sensitive network i.e. IoV and VANETs. So, a lightweight authentication protocol for RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification devices) has also been proposed to overcome the drawbacks of existing solutions and to provide better performance in terms of low detection time, low CPU and memory consumption to strengthen the existing IoV environment.}

We propose that augmenting data from multiple sensing devices such as Microsoft Kinect and Smartwatches can significantly improve the detection performance once incorporated in the context of an IoT framework. Kinect, being the feature-wise richest input device in the IoT world, is a favorite pick of most of the researchers for detecting postural activities. However, there are certain activity classes in IoT based smart environments on which Kinect based solutions result in high misclassifications. This is due to the similarities in 3D joint position space. For such scenarios, Kinect must be augmented with additional sensor(s) to achieve the desired level of accuracy. In this work, we improve the detection of the assistive activities related to sitting posture in general and dining-related activities in particular. Our research focus is to enable a robot to understand the activities of a human at the dining table and plan the assistive tasks accordingly. This is a two-step process; in the first step, Kinect sensor data is augmented with a collection of motion sensors’ data. Then, this data is analyzed for discrimination power through cross-validation of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). In addition, we propose a two-level security scheme consisting of key establishment and two-factor authentication for the IoT based activity recognition environment. Our experiments show that Kinect, when complemented by motion sensors’ data, reduces the confusion instances by up to 12% on average. Moreover, we demonstrate the data quality through clustering properties of the data using an unsupervised neural network.}

An ICS controls a physical plant through the use of sensors and actuators. A Historian sits on a plant network and receives, parses, and saves data and commands transmitted over the network, across the Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), sensors and actuators. This data has at least two uses. One use is to check for any process anomalies that may occur due to component failures and cyber attacks. The other use of this data, and the focus of this work, is to serve as critical input to off-line activities such as forensic analysis. A cyber attack on the Historian could jeopardize any forensic analysis be it for maintenance, or discovering an attack trail. In this work, a novel architecture, named ICS-BlockOpS, is proposed to secure plant operational data recorded in the Historian. ICS-BlockOpS is designed to enhance data security along two dimensions: immutability and redundancy. An integrity checking mechanism, in combination with blockchain, is used to ensure data integrity. Data redundancy is achieved by applying an efficient replication mechanism and enables data recovery after an attack. A prototype implementation of ICS-BlockOpS uses Ethereum blockchain in the local network as part of the tamper proofing mechanism. The implementation is in an operational six-stage water treatment plant. The underlying design ideas are generic and could be applied to other ICS as well.}

However, automatically analyzing log data is difficult since it contains massive amounts of unstructured and diverse messages collected from heterogeneous sources. Therefore, several approaches that condense or summarize log data by means of clustering techniques have been proposed. Picking the right approach for a particular application domain is, however, non-trivial, since algorithms are designed towards specific objectives and requirements. This paper therefore surveys existing approaches. It thereby groups approaches by their clustering techniques, reviews their applicability and limitations, discusses trends and identifies gaps. The survey reveals that approaches usually pursue one or more of four major objectives: overview and filtering, parsing and signature extraction, static outlier detection, and sequences and dynamic anomaly detection. Finally, this paper also outlines a concept and tool that support the selection of appropriate approaches based on user-defined requirements.}

The adoption of Internet of Things technologies, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and an increasingly wide range of sensing and actuation capabilities has led to smart homes that are more practical, but also genuinely attractive targets for cyber attacks. Here, we classify applicable cyber threats according to a novel taxonomy, focusing not only on the attack vectors that can be used, but also the potential impact on the systems and ultimately on the occupants and their domestic life. Utilising the taxonomy, we classify twenty five different smart home attacks, providing further examples of legitimate, yet vulnerable smart home configurations which can lead to second-order attack vectors. We then review existing smart home defence mechanisms and discuss open research problems.}

Current approaches attempting to solve mission impact assessment employ score-based algorithms leading to spurious results.

This paper provides a formal, mathematical model for bias- and context-free mission impact assessment. Based on a probabilistic model we reduce mission impact assessment to a well-understood mathematical problem based on definitions from local expertise and allow for a validation at data level. This is useful for areas and applications where qualitative assessments are required, such as assessments in critical infrastructures or military contexts.}

However, due to the lack of fundamental support from the Internet, individual solutions often share little common ground in their design, which causes a practical problem: deploying all these vastly different solutions will add exceedingly high complexity to the Internet routers. In this paper, we propose a simple generic extension to the Internet, providing a new type of information, called path addresses, that simplify the design of security systems for packet filtering, fair resource allocation, packet classification, IP traceback, filter push-back, etc. IP addresses are owned by end hosts; path addresses are owned by the network core, which is beyond the reach of the hosts. We describe how to enhance the Internet protocols for path addresses that meet the uniqueness requirement, completeness requirement, safety requirement, and incrementally deployable requirement. We evaluate the performance of our scheme both analytically and by simulations, which show that, at small overhead, the false positive ratio and the false negative ratio can both be made negligibly small.}

However, returned path computations may still reveal confidential intra-domain information, if artfully correlated by a malicious PCE. In such cases, the cooperation among PCEs should consider not only the capability of providing feasible paths but also the likelihood of security breaches (e.g., confidentiality risk exposure). In fact, a PCE might have the interest to block a request if it is arriving from a malicious or a competitor provider. In this scenario, the PCEs cooperation could benefit from a trust management model that accounts for the quality of the past interactions in terms of security violations while avoiding abuse of path computation services. This work introduces the concepts of Trust Ranking and Quality of Interaction in PCE-based multi-domain backbone networks and elaborates a Bayes trust model to regulate the cooperation among PCEs. Specifically, the proposed trust management model aims at creating a common interest for the PCEs in contributing to effective traffic engineering while avoiding misuse of path computation services. Accordingly, we further propose a trust-aware PCE architecture and an incentive-compatible decision model that stimulate the behaviors of PCEs towards an effective cooperation. Simulation results show that the proposed trust model provides effective incentive-compatible service differentiation to collaborating domains and is effective in detecting malicious PCE behaviors thereby tuning the amount of information returned in the path computation replies.}

To encompass different autonomous and collaborative systems with functions of data sensing and authentication between such systems in a predictive and adaptive manner is a challenging task. Wireless network design in 5G is expected to emphasize broadly on three facets: security, privacy and energy efficiency. Therefore, this paper investigates the role of various data security and privacy techniques for different generation networks, but emphasis is on 5G. It addresses encryption schemes with the focus on the challenges faced such as side channel and ciphertext attacks, inherent key generation, sharing and distribution, key escrow, analysis of various overheads, and potential techniques, and solutions to address such challenges by leveraging 5G network devices. With the proliferation of ubiquitous computing and wide adoption of hybrid encryption techniques, various attacks will be circumvent in an intelligent manner.}

Such degree of observability and permeability do, however, bear risks of malevolent tapping or interference with the information stream which, in the case of production systems, can put both business and physical processes at risk, requiring careful exploration of security threats in horizontal and vertical integration, and individual end-to-end connections likewise. Also, different levels of networked production present specific needs—high throughput and low time lag on the shop-floor level, or tolerances for confidence, gambling and bounded-rational views in cross-company relations—that may conflict with security policies. The paper presents a systematic summary of such apparently contradicting preferences, and possible approaches of reconciliation currently perceived to be relevant on various abstraction levels of production networks.}

This paper discusses the importance and impact of decision-making on the robustness of trust systems in hostile environments and shows its great impact in this regard. In the paper, the most important trust based decision-making methods are investigated using formal verification methods in different attack scenarios (including maliciousness and selfishness) and the results are analyzed to find the strengths and weaknesses of each one. Considering the obtained results, the paper also proposed a new approach for trust-based decision making. The case studies show that the proposed approach is able to improve the robustness of trust and reputation models in all different attack scenarios.}

Although the implementation of smart grids offers technical and social advantages, the smart meters deployed in smart grids are susceptible to more attacks and network intrusions by energy thieves as compared to conventional mechanical meters. To mitigate non-technical losses due to electricity thefts and inaccurate smart meters readings, utility providers are leveraging on the energy consumption data collected from the advanced metering infrastructure implemented in smart grids to identify possible defective smart meters and abnormal consumers’ consumption patterns. In this paper, we design two linear regression-based algorithms to study consumers’ energy utilization behavior and evaluate their anomaly coefficients so as to combat energy theft caused by meter tampering and detect defective smart meters. Categorical variables and detection coefficients are also introduced in the model to identify the periods and locations of energy frauds as well as faulty smart meters. Simulations are conducted and the results show that the proposed algorithms can successfully detect all the fraudulent consumers and discover faulty smart meters in a neighborhood area network.}

In general, ITS aims at ensuring better traffic efficiency and reducing road accidents. However, due to different limitations and issues, these systems suffer from different security and privacy vulnerabilities. In fact, they are both vulnerable to various types of security and privacy attacks that may result in life-endangering situations. As a result, several solutions were presented to achieve the required levels of security and confidentiality. In this paper, an overview of ITS is presented stating the reasons behind the evolution from Vanet to IoV.

The network policies in the large-scale network are difficult to embed on entire network devices simultaneously, whereas in SDN these policies can be embedded on the top of the network. The SDN network is divided into two parts which are vertically integrated to form the entire network. The policies and control mechanism are handled by the top layer called the control plane, whereas the data forwarding is performed at the bottom layer called the data plane. Thus the SDN forms a logically centralized network. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on the various issues, challenges, and solutions in the designing, implementation, performance, and verification of SDN. The network design emphasized on scalability, fault-tolerance, flexibility, and elasticity. Further implementation issues discuss resource management and virtualization. Similarly, latency, efficiency, and consistency discuss under-performance measure. Lastly, we focus on security and debugging in verification of SDN. We elaborate all the above issues and further discuss the different solutions that exist and discussed the future research trends in SDN.}

This is not practical for an organization to perform these activities within the time-frame of an impending attack. Organizations should swiftly accumulate and share Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) with peers to make effective use of shared threat information. Efforts are underway for standardizing the expression of threats into a machine-understandable format. Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) is a comprehensive effort that structures CTI, enables its sharing, visualization, and analysis. Although a large volume of STIX reports is available publicly, their state remains poor. Reports are not appropriately formatted, use incorrect vocabulary, and mislabel or omit key components, which curtail their usefulness for effective cyber threat management. For a meaningful analysis, an analyst needs a curated document list categorized according to cyber threat management phases for the under-investigation threat. We believe that methods for valuation of structured threat documents based on cyber threat management phases are limited or non-existent. We present a novel framework named SCERM—Structured threat data Cleansing, Evaluation, and Refinement. SCERM formally models the STIX architecture and valuates reports on the basis of the use case “managing cyber threat response activities”. It uplifts CTI by remapping wrongly placed contents to the STIX data model. SCERM refines incomplete or missing components through a pre-prepared dataset of curated blog reports. This process is repeated until the reports improve to a threshold suitable for cyber threat management. A case study is presented to demonstrate the working of SCERM. The evaluation valuates publicly available STIXs for cyber threat management. It is observed that current STIX reports have limited information on prevention and almost none for the response phase of cyber threat management. The results demonstrate that SCERM significantly enriches STIX reports. The improvement in prevention is 73% and in the response is a 100%.}

We employ a validated non-linear queuing model to derive two non-linear robust throughput controllers. A notable feature of the proposed scheme is its capability of predicting harvest-able energy. The predictions are generated using the proposed Accurate Solar Irradiance prediction Model (ASIM) whose effectiveness in generating accurate both long and short term predictions is demonstrated using real world data. The stability of the proposed controllers is established analytically and the effectiveness of the proposed strategies is demonstrated using simulations conducted on the Network Simulator (NS-3). The proposed policy is successful in guiding the energy level to the reference value, and outperforms the Throughput Optimal (TO) policy in terms of the throughput achieved.}

In Software-Defined Wireless Sensor Networks (SDWSNs), security and energy are two critical issues. However, few studies address these two aspects simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an Energy-efficient Trust Management and Routing Mechanism (ETMRM) for SDWSNs to handle the malicious forwarding attacks, such as selective forwarding attack and new-flow attack. In the ETMRM, we firstly extend the SensorFlow tables to realize a light-weight trust monitoring and evaluation scheme at the node level, and propose a centralized trust management scheme at the controller level to detect and isolate the malicious nodes based on the trust information collected from sensor nodes. Secondly, we present an energy-efficient report message aggregating scheme for aggregation points’ selection to save energy and ensure the transmission of control traffic. Thirdly, we present a trust routing mechanism jointly considering the node’s residual energy and trust level to guarantee the transmission of data traffic. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture detects and responds to the internal network attacks, such as Greyhole, Blackhole, new-flow attacks, efficiently. Compared with the related work SDN-WISE, ETMRM improves the packet delivery ratio, reduces and balances the energy consumption, prolongs the network lifetime, and suffers lower control overhead.}

With several drones flying in different zones to carry out specified tasks, the IoD can be beneficial to gather the real time data for interpretation by the users. However, the data access is carried out through an open channel and battery operated drones. Therefore, the drones’ security and privacy are crucial for accomplishing mission-critical, safety-critical, or surveillance operations. In 2020, Bera et al. presented a certificate based access control scheme for securing the IoD access and argued the scheme’s security through formal and informal methods. However, the analysis presented in this paper shows that the scheme of Bera et al. does not provide anonymity and is insecure against multiple threats, including drone impersonation, the man in the middle, and replay attacks. We then designed a generic certificate based access control scheme to provide inter-drone and drone to ground station access control/authentication in the IoD domain (GCACS-IoD). The GCACS-IoD is provably secure against the known attacks and provides anonymity. GCACS-IoD extends security while preserving computation and communication efficiencies.}

In this paper, we perform an empirical analysis of a large number of web vulnerability reports with the aim of understanding how input validation flaws have evolved in the last decade. In particular, we are interested in finding out if developers are more aware of web security problems today than they used to be in the past. Our results suggest that the complexity of the attacks have not changed significantly and that many web problems are still simple in nature. Hence, despite awareness programs provided by organizations such as MITRE, SANS Institute and OWASP, application developers seem to be either not aware of these classes of vulnerabilities, or unable to implement effective countermeasures.

The optimal solutions of SVMs may be misled by the spread of data and preferentially separate classes along large margin directions. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel minimum class spread constrained support vector machine (MCSSVM) for pattern classification problems by simultaneously considering the maximization of inter-class separation margin and the minimization of within-class spread of data, which corresponds to a distribution-dependent regularization on the classification function by constraining the within-class spread of input data. The basic idea of MCSSVM is to find a class distribution constrained hyperplane such that one class (or normal class) can be enclosed in a minimum q-spread tube, while the other class (or abnormal class) is farthest from this tube. MCSSVM can simultaneously achieve both maximum inter-class margin and minimum within-class spread so as to enhance the generalization capability of the proposed classifier. Moreover, the proposed method only requires simple extensions to existing maximum margin formulations such as SVMs and still preserves their computational efficiency. Generalization bound for MCSSVM is theoretically derived and the validity of MCSSVM is examined by classification of toy and real-world classification problems, which demonstrate the superiority of our method in comparison to other related state-of-the-art algorithms.}

Trust management is an effective method to solve these problems by establishing trust relationships among interconnected IoT objects. In this paper, we propose an adaptive trust model based on recommendation filtering algorithm for the IoT systems. The utilization of sliding window and time decay function when calculating direct trust can greatly accelerate the convergence rate of trust evaluation. We design a recommendation filtering algorithm to effectively filter out bad recommendations and minimize the impact of malicious objects. An adaptive weight is developed to better combine direct trust and recommendation trust into synthesis trust so as to adapt to the dynamically hostile environment. In the simulation experiments, we compare our adaptive trust model with three related models: TBSM, NRB and NTM. The experimental results indicate that our trust model converges fast and the mean absolute error is always less than 0.05 when the proportion of malicious nodes is from 10% to 70%. The comparative experiments further verify the effectiveness of our trust model in terms of accuracy, convergence rate and resistance to trust related attacks.}

The tools in the Haruspex suite model intelligent, goal-oriented attackers that reach their goals through sequences of attacks. The tools synthetically generate these sequences through a Monte Carlo method that runs multiple simulations of the attacker behavior. This paper presents a sequential pattern mining analysis of the attack sequence database to extract a high-level and succinct understanding of the attacker strategies against the system to assess. Such an understanding is expressed as a set of sequential patterns that cover, and possibly partition, the attack sequences. This set can be extracted in isolation, or in contrast with the behavior of other attackers. In the latter case, the patterns represent a signature of the behavior of an attacker. The dynamic tools of the suite use this signature to deploy dynamic counter-measures that reduce the security risk. We formally motivate the need for using the class of maximal sequential patterns in covering attack sequences, instead of frequent or closed sequential patterns. When contrasting the behavior of different attackers, we resort to distinguishing sequential patterns. We report an extensive experimentation on a system with 36 nodes, 6 attackers, and 600K attack sequences.}

One of the most important concerns is to ensure vehicle systems take appropriate and safe actions to diminish the probability of cyber-attacks success and mitigate the ramifications of potential unauthorized access. In this work, we present a layered systematic approach to achieve these goals along with a real implementation on an electric motorcycle. The developed secure infrastructure involves secure interconnection mechanisms to ensure trustworthy communications for electronic control nodes; hardware firewall to prevent interference and unauthorized access from untrusted applications/firmware; separated OS instances for different execution environments to provide best possible support for apps with different requirements and to further isolate apps from each other; and finally secure deployment of apps/firmware to ensure that apps are deployed unaltered to the automotive platform. In particular, considering both in-vehicle’s units resource-constraints, in terms of cost and size, and security needs that emerge in open bus-based networks, we introduce a secure technology that helps to prevent cyber-attacks in automotive Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol which is often used in in-vehicle networks. This technology, which we call secure CAN (sCAN), respects standard CAN-bus and realizes security mechanisms implemented in software or hardware, while adding less than 1 ms latency on the communication. sCAN in synergy with on-chip hardware firewalling which controls authorization level of on-chip accesses, and finally, together with securing the deployment of firmware updating over the air, build a fully-layered approach for connected vehicles to protect system assets, such as application and device authenticity, integrity, confidentiality, and availability.}

Vehicular Ad hoc networks (VANETs), are a particular case of ad hoc networks that are used in the smart ITS. VANETs have become one of the most, encouraging, promising, and fastest-growing subsets of the mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). They are comprised of smart vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) and on-board units (OBUs) which communicate through unreliable wireless media. Other than lacking infrastructure, delivering entities move with different increasing speeds. Thus, this delays establishing reliable end-to-end communication paths and having efficient data transfer. In this manner, VANETs have diverse system concerns and security difficulties in getting the accessibility of ubiquitous availability, secure communication, interchanges, and reputation management system. Which influence the trust in collaboration and arrangement between the portable system. By their fluctuation in nature, they are genuinely defenseless against assaults, which may result in life-jeopardizing circumstances.

abstract = {Drones, which are also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), are very useful in delivering the packages, and real-time object detection and tracking with minimal human interference. However, there may be several security threats in such an environment, for instance, a malicious user can spy unauthorized drones, transfer malicious packages, or even damage the network reliability that can have direct impact on drones control. This may lead to a potential threat for people, governments, and business sectors. To deal with these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel access control scheme for unauthorized UAV detection and mitigation in an Internet of Drones (IoD) environment, called ACSUD-IoD. With the help of the blockchain-based solution incorporated in ACSUD-IoD, the transactional data having both the normal secure data from a drone (UAV) to the Ground Station Server (GSS) and the abnormal (suspected) data for detection of unauthorized UAVs by the GSS are stored in private blockchain, that are authentic and genuine. As a result, the Big data analytics can be performed on the authenticated transactional data stored in the blockchain. Through the detailed security analysis including formal security under the broadly-accepted Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, formal security verification using the widely-applied Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool and non-mathematical security analysis show the robustness of the proposed scheme against a number of potential attacks needed in an IoD environment. The testbed experiments for various cryptographic primitives using the broadly-accepted Multiprecision Integer and Rational Arithmetic Cryptographic Library (MIRACL) have been performed under both server and Raspberry PI 3 configurations. Furthermore, a detailed comparative analysis among the proposed scheme and other existing competing schemes shows the efficacy and more robustness as compared to the existing schemes. Finally, the blockchain-based practical demonstration shows the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}

We extend the attack space into multiple dimensions by randomizing the data acquisition in multiple rounds. In each round, we increase apparent complexity and uncertainty in the network communications with controlled changes. To reduce the traffic burden, we design the packet random dropping policy included in NMMTD for end-to-end oblivious communications . We demonstrate the effectiveness of NMMTD in preventing the attacker from intercepting data packets and securing power system against FDIA with little impact on both the network and system performances.}

An effective defense against the automatic form filling and posting from blog bots is to detect and validate the human presence. Conventional detection methods usually require direct participation of human users, such as recognizing a CAPTCHA image, which can be burdensome for users. In this paper, we present a new detection approach by using behavioral biometrics, primarily mouse and keystroke dynamics, to distinguish between human and bot. Based on passive monitoring, the proposed approach does not require any direct user participation. We collect real user input data from a very active online community and blog site, and use this data to characterize behavioral differences between human and bot. The most useful features for classification provide the basis for a detection system consisting of two main components: a webpage-embedded logger and a server-side classifier. The webpage-embedded logger records mouse movement and keystroke data while a user is filling out a form, and provides this data in batches to a server-side detector, which classifies the poster as human or bot. Our experimental results demonstrate an overall detection accuracy greater than 99%, with negligible overhead.}

Exploiting human vulnerabilities (i.e., social engineering) is an approach widely used to achieve this goal. Improving the security awareness of users is an effective method for mitigating social engineering attacks. However, while in the domain of personal computers (PCs) the security awareness of users is relatively high, previous studies have shown that for the mobile platform, the security awareness level is significantly lower. The skills required from a mobile user to interact safely with his/her smartphone are different from those that are required for safe and responsible PC use. Therefore, the awareness of mobile users to security risks is an important aspect of information security. An essential and challenging requirement of assessing security awareness is the definition of measureable criteria for a security aware user. In this paper, we present a hierarchical taxonomy for security awareness, specifically designed for mobile device users. The taxonomy defines a set of measurable criteria that are categorized according to different technological focus areas (e.g., applications and browsing) and within the context of psychological dimensions (e.g., knowledge, attitude, and behavior). We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed taxonomy by introducing an expert-based procedure for deriving mobile security awareness models for different attack classes (each class is an aggregation of social engineering attacks that exploit a similar set of human vulnerabilities). Each model reflects the contribution (weight) of each criterion to the mitigation of the corresponding attack class. Application of the proposed procedure, based on the input of 17 security experts, to derive mobile security awareness models of four different attack classes, confirms that the skills required from a smartphone user to mitigate an attack are different for different attack classes.}

abstract = {Context
Early detection of heart disease is an important challenge since 17.3 million people yearly lose their lives due to heart diseases. Besides, any error in diagnosis of cardiac disease can be dangerous and risks an individual's life. Accurate diagnosis is therefore critical in cardiology. Data Mining (DM) classification techniques have been used to diagnosis heart diseases but still limited by some challenges of data quality such as inconsistencies, noise, missing data, outliers, high dimensionality and imbalanced data. Data preprocessing (DP) techniques were therefore used to prepare data with the goal of improving the performance of heart disease DM based prediction systems.
Objective
The purpose of this study is to review and summarize the current evidence on the use of preprocessing techniques in heart disease classification as regards: (1) the DP tasks and techniques most frequently used, (2) the impact of DP tasks and techniques on the performance of classification in cardiology, (3) the overall performance of classifiers when using DP techniques, and (4) comparisons of different combinations classifier-preprocessing in terms of accuracy rate.
Method
A systematic literature review is carried out, by identifying and analyzing empirical studies on the application of data preprocessing in heart disease classification published in the period between January 2000 and June 2019. A total of 49 studies were therefore selected and analyzed according to the aforementioned criteria.
Results
The review results show that data reduction is the most used preprocessing task in cardiology, followed by data cleaning. In general, preprocessing either maintained or improved the performance of heart disease classifiers. Some combinations such as (ANN + PCA), (ANN + CHI) and (SVM + PCA) are promising terms of accuracy. However the deployment of these models in real-world diagnosis decision support systems is subject to several risks and limitations due to the lack of interpretation.}

However, widely researched CA mechanisms that rely on user’s behavioural characteristics cannot be extended to continuously authenticate Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Challenges are exacerbated with the increased adoption of device-to-device (d2d) communication in critical infrastructures. Existing d2d authentication protocols proposed in the literature are either prone to subversion or are computationally infeasible to be deployed on constrained IoT devices. In view of these challenges, we propose a novel, Lightweight Continuous Device-to-Device Authentication (LCDA) protocol that leverages communication channel properties and a tunable mathematical function to generate dynamically changing session keys for continuous device authentication. Our extensive informal and formal analysis confirms the efficacy of the proposed LCDA protocol in terms of its resilience to known attack vectors, thereby demonstrating its strong potential for deployment in critical and resource-constrained scenarios for secure d2d communication.}

abstract = {Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) enables communication in opportunistic networks where disruptive links result into intermittent connectivity. Routing protocols in such opportunistic environments mainly rely on broadcast/multicast communication in order to maximize the chances of packet delivery to destination node. Lack of end-to-end path and the essential requirement of store-carry-forward decision of packets by intermediate nodes, pose a serious threat to security and privacy concerns in DTNs. This article proposes a novel approach for secure and private communication in DTNs by hiding the identity of nodes using pseudonyms. The approach is based on Privacy by Architecture (PbA) where minimal identifying information of a user is sent to a certificate authority (CA) while requesting for a certificate. The novel PbA based scheme is composed of a set of protocols to address the aforementioned challenges; the Pseudonym Credential and Pseudonym Identity/Certificate Issuance protocols. The proposed approach is validated using formal modeling in CasperFDR which is the state-of-the art compiler for performance analysis of security protocols. To strengthen our claim, an information theoretic quantification method is employed to measure the Degree of Anonymity (DoA) of the approach. The approach performs efficiently and requires no end-to-end connectivity for messages exchange between the user and the certificate authority, thus making it an ideal choice for ensuring security and privacy in DTNs. Results show that the proposed approach guards against privacy attacks and delivers a high degree of anonymity even in the presence of compromised nodes in the network.}

abstract = {This article presents a concise reliability analysis of network security abstracted from stochastic modeling, reliability, and queuing theories. Network security analysis is composed of threats, their impacts, and recovery of the failed systems. A unique framework with a collection of the key reliability models is presented here to guide the determination of the system reliability based on the strength of malicious acts and performance of the recovery processes. A unique model, called Attack-obstacle model, is also proposed here for analyzing systems with immunity growth features. Most computer science curricula do not contain courses in reliability modeling applicable to different areas of computer engineering. Hence, the topic of reliability analysis is often too diffuse to most computer engineers and researchers dealing with network security. This work is thus aimed at shedding some light on this issue, which can be useful in identifying models, their assumptions and practical parameters for estimating the reliability of threatened systems and for assessing the performance of recovery facilities. It can also be useful for the classification of processes and states regarding the reliability of information systems. Systems with stochastic behaviors undergoing queue operations and random state transitions can also benefit from the approaches presented here.}

abstract = {We introduce the notion of rate-limited secure function evaluation (RL-SFE). Loosely speaking, in an RL-SFE protocol participants can monitor and limit the number of distinct inputs (i.e., rate) used by their counterparts in multiple executions of an SFE, in a private and verifiable manner. The need for RL-SFE naturally arises in a variety of scenarios: e.g., it enables service providers to “meter” their customers' usage without compromising their privacy, or can be used to prevent oracle attacks against SFE constructions. We consider three variants of RL-SFE providing different levels of security. As a stepping stone, we also formalize the notion of commit-first SFE (CF-SFE) wherein parties are committed to their inputs before each SFE execution. We provide compilers for transforming any CF-SFE protocol into each of the three RL-SFE variants. Our compilers are accompanied with simulation-based proofs of security in the standard model and show a clear tradeoff between the level of security offered and the overhead required. Moreover, motivated by the fact that in many client–server applications clients do not keep state, we also describe a general approach for transforming the resulting RL-SFE protocols into stateless ones. As a case study, we take a closer look at the oblivious polynomial evaluation (OPE) protocol of Hazay and Lindell, show that it is commit-first, and instantiate efficient rate-limited variants of it.}

In this scenario, the satisfaction of security and privacy requirements plays a fundamental role. Such requirements include data confidentiality and authentication, access control within the IoT network, privacy and trust among users and things, and the enforcement of security and privacy policies. Traditional security countermeasures cannot be directly applied to IoT technologies due to the different standards and communication stacks involved. Moreover, the high number of interconnected devices arises scalability issues; therefore a flexible infrastructure is needed able to deal with security threats in such a dynamic environment. In this survey we present the main research challenges and the existing solutions in the field of IoT security, identifying open issues, and suggesting some hints for future research.}

abstract = {Driven by expanding scientific computing and business enterprise needs, the last decade has seen a shift toward software paradigms in which distribution plays a central role. The increasing size, complexity and heterogeneity of the corresponding systems is accompanied by an increase of security vulnerabilities that require mitigation via combined security and software engineering strategies. In this respect security patterns, which build on the success of design patterns and software patterns more generally, are a tool of great value. In this paper we comprehensively survey the state-of-the-art in securing distributed systems using (security) patterns, considering both relevant patterns and methodologies for applying them. In the first part of the survey, we provide detailed reviews of our selected security patterns, classify the patterns using a multi-dimensional scheme and evaluate them according to a set of quality categories. This highlights deficiencies in the reviewed patterns and provides a basis for identifying new or “missing” patterns and pattern classes. The newly identified and surveyed patterns are a step forward in defining a pattern language for distributed computing. In the second part of the survey, we briefly review a number of pattern-based security methodologies and evaluate their maturity and appropriateness for securing distributed systems.}

Detection of Internet Censorship is the basis for the study of this phenomenon, and recently it has received focus from a technical point of view. Due to the heterogeneity of study fields and approaches, the scientific corpus on these topics is still in need of an overall analysis, based on coherent framework and lexicon to describe the experimented approaches and findings. In this paper we present a survey on Internet Censorship detection. We propose a reference for censoring techniques and a characterization of censoring systems, with definitions of related concepts. Based on the censoring techniques investigated in literature, we propose an analysis and discussion of censorship detection techniques and architectures and we present a chronological synopsis of the literature adopting or introducing them. Then we collect, study, and discuss available tools and platforms for censorship detection, and propose a characterization scheme to analyze and compare them. Finally, we compare and discuss detection architectures, tools and platforms, and we use the results to infer current challenges and for proposing new directions in the field of censorship detection.}

abstract = {Context
Software vulnerabilities in general, and software vulnerabilities with publicly available exploits in particular, are important to manage for both developers and users. This is however a difficult matter to address as time is limited and vulnerabilities are frequent.
Objective
This paper presents a Bayesian network based model that can be used by enterprise decision makers to estimate the likelihood that a professional penetration tester is able to obtain knowledge of critical vulnerabilities and exploits for these vulnerabilities for software under different circumstances.
Method
Data on the activities in the model are gathered from previous empirical studies, vulnerability databases and a survey with 58 individuals who all have been credited for the discovery of critical software vulnerabilities.
Results
The proposed model describes 13 states related by 17 activities, and a total of 33 different datasets.
Conclusion
Estimates by the model can be used to support decisions regarding what software to acquire, or what measures to invest in during software development projects.}

abstract = {With the extensively study on moving target defense, optimal strategy generation has become one of the key problems in current research. A novel of incomplete information Markov game theoretic approach to strategy generation for moving target defense is proposed to solve the existing problems. On the one hand, traditional matrix game structure and complete information assumption often fail to describe moving target defense confrontation accurately. To deal with this inaccuracy, moving target defense game model based on incomplete information Markov game theory is constructed by introducing moving attack surface and moving exploration surface concept, extending optimal strategy selection of moving target defense with incomplete information from mono-state or mono-phase to multi-stated and multi-phased. On the other hand, traditional models care little about defense cost in the process of optimal strategy generation. After comprehensively analyzing the impact of defensive cost and defensive benefit on strategy generation, an optimal strategy generation algorithm is designed to prevent the deviation of the selected strategies from actual network conditions, thus ensuring the correctness of optimal strategy generation. Finally, simulation and deduction experiments have been performed in a case study so as to confirm the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

abstract = {While identifying the intention of an utterance has played a major role in natural language understanding, this work is the first to extend intention recognition to the domain of information graphics. A tenet of this work is the belief that information graphics are a form of language. This is supported by the observation that the overwhelming majority of information graphics from popular media sources appear to have some underlying goal or intended message. As Clark noted, language is more than just words. It is any “signal” (or lack of signal when one is expected), where a signal is a deliberate action that is intended to convey a message (Clark, 1996 [15]). As a form of language, information graphics contain communicative signals that can be used in a computational system to identify the message that the graphic conveys. We identify the communicative signals that appear in simple bar charts, and present an implemented Bayesian network methodology for reasoning about these signals and hypothesizing a bar chart's intended message. Once the message conveyed by an information graphic has been inferred, it can then be used to facilitate access to this information resource for a variety of users, including 1) users of digital libraries, 2) visually impaired users, and 3) users of devices where graphics are impractical or inaccessible.}
