Because of the wireless nature and the unique network properties, FANET remains vulnerable to jamming attack with additional challenges. First, a decision from a centralized knowledge base is unsuitable because of the communication and power constraints in FANET. Second, the high mobility and the low density of the UAVs in FANET require constant adaptation to newly explored spatial environments containing unbalanced data; rendering a distributed jamming detection mechanism inadequate. Third, taking model-based jamming defense actions in a newly explored environment, without a precise estimation of the transitional probabilities, is challenging. Therefore, we propose an adaptive federated reinforcement learning-based jamming attack defense strategy. We developed a model-free Q-learning mechanism with an adaptive exploration-exploitation epsilon-greedy policy, directed by an ondevice federated jamming detection mechanism. The simulation results revealed that the proposed adaptive federated reinforcement learning-based defense strategy outperformed the baseline methods by significantly reducing the number of en route jammer location hop counts. The results also showed that the average accuracy of the federated jamming detection mechanism, leveraged in the defense strategy, was 39.9% higher than that of the distributed mechanism verified with the standard CRAWDAD jamming attack dataset and the ns-3 simulated FANET jamming attack dataset.","1976-5541","","10.1109/JCN.2020.000015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9143577","Federated learning;flying ad-hoc network;jamming attack;on-device AI;reinforcement learning","Jamming;Adaptation models;Learning (artificial intelligence);Unmanned aerial vehicles;Base stations;Vehicular ad hoc networks","autonomous aerial vehicles;greedy algorithms;jamming;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile ad hoc networks;probability;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security","centralized knowledge base;power constraints;UAV;model-free Q-learning mechanism;adaptive exploration-exploitation epsilon-greedy policy;federated jamming detection mechanism;standard CRAWDAD jamming attack dataset;ns-3 simulated FANET jamming attack dataset;intelligent jamming defense;flying ad-hoc network;decentralized communication network;unmanned aerial vehicles;adaptive federated reinforcement learning;distributed jamming detection mechanism;transitional probabilities;en route jammer location hop counts","","13","","","","17 Jul 2020","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

COPOD first constructs an empirical copula, and then uses it to predict tail probabilities of each given data point to determine its level of “extremeness”. Intuitively, we think of this as calculating an anomalous p-value. This makes COPOD both parameter-free, highly interpretable, and computationally efficient. In this work, we make three key contributions, 1) propose a novel, parameter-free outlier detection algorithm with both great performance and interpretability, 2) perform extensive experiments on 30 benchmark datasets to show that COPOD outperforms in most cases and is also one of the fastest algorithms, and 3) release an easy-to-use Python implementation for reproducibility.","2374-8486","978-1-7281-8316-9","10.1109/ICDM50108.2020.00135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9338429","outlier detection, anomaly detection, copula, data mining","Conferences;Computational modeling;Prediction algorithms;Data models;Computational efficiency;Task analysis;Anomaly detection","computational complexity;data mining;probability","COPOD;copula-based outlier detection;general data distribution;computational complexity;predictive capability;multivariate data distribution;empirical copula;parameter-free outlier detection algorithm","","","","14","","9 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, existing flow-based approaches typically incur a high computational overhead and do not completely capture the network communication patterns, which can expose additional aspects of malicious hosts. Recently, bot detection systems which leverage communication graph analysis using ML have gained attention to overcome these limitations. A graph-based approach is rather intuitive, as graphs are true representations of network communications. In this paper, we propose a two-phased, graph-based bot detection system which leverages both unsupervised and supervised ML. The first phase prunes presumable benign hosts, while the second phase achieves bot detection with high precision. Our system detects multiple types of bots and is robust to zero-day attacks. It also accommodates different network topologies and is suitable for large-scale data.","1573-0077","978-3-903176-15-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8717821","","Feature extraction;Botnet;Protocols;Training;Data models;Machine learning;Organizations","computer network security;graph theory;invasive software;unsupervised learning","network topologies;graph-based machine learning approach;communication graph analysis;flow-based approaches;unsupervised ML;zero-day attacks;unsupervised ML;graph-based bot detection system;network communications;bot detection systems;network communication patterns;high computational overhead;network flow-level features","","","","42","","20 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Today, network attacks are increasing in terms of both their number and sophistication. To avoid causing significant traffic patterns and being detected by existing techniques, many new attacks tend to involve gradual adjustment of behaviors, which always generate incomplete sessions due to their running mechanisms. Accordingly, in this work, we employ the behavior symmetry degree to profile the anomalies and further identify unusual behaviors. We first proposed a symmetry degree to identify the incomplete sessions generated by unusual behaviors; we then employ a sketch to calculate the symmetry degree of internal hosts to improve the identification efficiency for online applications. To reduce the memory cost and probability of collision, we divide the IP addresses into four segments that can be used as keys of the hash functions in the sketch. Moreover, to further improve detection accuracy, a threshold selection method is proposed for dynamic traffic pattern analysis. The hash functions in the sketch are then designed using Chinese remainder theory, which can analytically trace the IP addresses associated with the anomalies. We tested the proposed techniques based on traffic data collected from the northwest center of CERNET (China Education and Research Network); the results show that the proposed methods can effectively detect anomalies in large-scale networks.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2019.2933731","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2016YFE0206700); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772411,61672026,61602370,U1736205); ShenZhen Science and Technology Innovation(grant numbers:JCYJ20170816100819428); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central University; Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China Program(grant numbers:2018JM6109); China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201706285018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8790758","Smart attacks;behavior patterns;symmetry degree;degree sketch;anomaly tracing","IP networks;Anomaly detection;Hash functions;Security;Monitoring;Feature extraction;Computational modeling","computer network security;cryptography;IP networks;number theory;telecommunication traffic","behavior symmetry degree;memory cost;IP addresses;hash functions;dynamic traffic pattern analysis;traffic data;large-scale networks;symmetry degree measurement;anomaly detection;unusual network behavior;network attacks;threshold selection method;Chinese remainder theory;CERNET;China Education and Research Network","","","","57","IEEE","7 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically to safety, IoV complements autonomous cars beyond sensors' line-of-sight, facilitating vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications in a smart transportation environment. The correctness of data exchanged among vehicles is paramount to ensure vehicles behave as per norms. Traditional misbehavior detection methods hardly defend vehicular security effectively due to rapid dynamics and location privacy. In particular, those node-centric classifiers become ill-fit in IoV. This work proposes a data-centric misbehavior detection model based on supervised machine learning (ML). The work also integrates plausibility checks with ML techniques and instantiates the model with six algorithms to demonstrate their comparative effectiveness. In addition to misbehavior detection, the model classifies attack types to support validating countermeasures. Specifically, the work analyzes the supervised learning algorithms for detecting misbehavior in IoV, compares their performance, and identifies their limitations. VeReMi, a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) position forgery attack built-in simulated road traffic data set, is used to test the effectiveness of the proposed model. The performance metrics include precision-recall (PR) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

With important discoveries made by adversarial learning research, surprisingly little attention, however, has been paid to the real-world adversarial techniques deployed by the cybercriminal to evade image-based detection. Unlike the adversarial examples that induce misclassification using nearly imperceivable perturbation, real-world adversarial images tend to be less optimal yet equally effective. As a first step to understand the threat, we report in the paper a study on adversarial promotional porn images (APPIs) that are extensively used in underground advertising. We show that the adversary today's strategically constructs the APPIs to evade explicit content detection while still preserving their sexual appeal, even though the distortions and noise introduced are clearly observable to humans. To understand such real-world adversarial images and the underground business behind them, we develop a novel DP-based methodology called Male`na, which focuses on the regions of an image where sexual content is least obfuscated and therefore visible to the target audience of a promotion. Using this technique, we have discovered over 4,000 APPIs from 4,042,690 images crawled from popular social media, and further brought to light the unique techniques they use to evade popular explicit content detectors (e.g., Google Cloud Vision API, Yahoo Open NSFW model), and the reason that these techniques work. Also studied are the ecosystem of such illicit promotions, including the obfuscated contacts advertised through those images, compromised accounts used to disseminate them, and large APPI campaigns involving thousands of images. Another interesting finding is the apparent attempt made by cybercriminals to steal others' images for their advertising. The study highlights the importance of the research on real-world adversarial learning and makes the first step towards mitigating the threats it poses.","2375-1207","978-1-5386-6660-9","10.1109/SP.2019.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8835391","adversarial-images;cybercrime;deep-learning","Google;Feature extraction;Detectors;Advertising;Ecosystems;Image recognition;Deep learning","application program interfaces;computer crime;image representation;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;social networking (online);social sciences computing","real-world adversarial images;illicit online promotion;security;machine learning studies;adversarial learning research;real-world adversarial techniques;image-based detection;adversarial examples;adversarial promotional porn images;adversary today;real-world adversarial learning;APPI","","4","","61","","16 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A malfunction of the deep learning model may occur if the training dataset includes malicious or erroneous data. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can give some insight for improving the deep learning model by explaining the cause of the malfunction. In this paper, we propose a method for explaining the working mechanism of deep-learning-based traffic classification as a method of XAI based on a genetic algorithm. We describe the mechanism of the deep-learning-based traffic classifier by quantifying the importance of each feature. In addition, we leverage the genetic algorithm to generate a feature selection mask that selects important features in the entire feature set.

In order to increase interoperability, real-time availability of data, and flexibility, information/communication technologies are adopted in this domain. While these information technologies have been effective, they are integrated into operational technologies without the necessary security defense. Designing an effective, layered security defense is not possible unless security threats are identified through a structural analysis of the ICS. For that reason, this paper provides an attacker's point of view on the reconnaissance effort necessary to gather details of the system dynamics - which are required for the development of sophisticated attacks.

One of these techniques is application-layer DoS. Due to these challenges, network security has become increasingly more challenging to ensure. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), Domain Name System (DNS), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and other protocol applications have seen increased attacks over the past several years. It is common for application-layer attacks to concentrate on these protocols because of some weaknesses that attackers can exploit. With some leveraging, application-layer attacks can vary, such as flood and “low and slow” attacks. Low and slow approaches are particularly well-known, mainly targeting weaknesses in the HTTP protocol, which is the most broadly used application-layer protocol on the Internet. Our paper aims to develop a generalized detection approach to identify features for application-layer DoS attacks that is not specific to a single slow DoS attack. We combine four application-layer DoS attack datasets: Slow Read, POST, Slowloris, and Apache Range Header to produce a single dataset for multiple attacks. We performed a feature extraction technique Principal Component Analysis (PCA), with the single dataset to reduce dimensionality. PCA transforms our existing dataset onto a new feature space to identify four separate application-layer attacks. We explore this method to improve six machine learners used in our work. Experimental results show that the machine learners successfully identified the multiple Slow DoS attacks with high detection while minimizing false alarm rates. The experiment demonstrates that when machine learners use Netflow features and feature extraction methods, they can discriminate and detect such attacks.","","978-1-6654-3875-9","10.1109/IRI51335.2021.00030","NSF(grant numbers:CNS-1427536); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9599101","Application Layer DoS Attacks;DoS Detection;Machine Learning;Intrusion Detection;Netflow;Principal Component Analysis","Protocols;Machine learning;Transforms;Tools;Feature extraction;Web servers;Rough surfaces","","","","","","30","","17 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A DIFTbased defense tracks the propagation of suspicious information flows across the system and dynamically generates security analysis to identify possible attacks, at the cost of additional performance and memory overhead for analyzing non-adversarial information flows. In this paper, we model the interaction between adversarial information flows and DIFT on a partially known system as a nonzero-sum stochastic game. Our game model captures the probability that the adversary evades detection even when it is analyzed using the security policies (false-negatives) and the performance overhead incurred by the defender for analyzing the non-adversarial flows in the system. We prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium (NE) and propose a supervised learning-based approach to find an approximate NE. Our approach is based on a partially input convex neural network that learns a mapping between the strategies and payoffs of the players with the available system knowledge, and an alternating optimization technique that updates the players' strategies to obtain an approximate equilibrium.

In this work, we propose a novel architecture, namely Decoupling Autoencoder (DAE) to tackle the common issue of robustness w.r.t. out-of-distribution samples which is prevalent in classifiers such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) and ensemble architectures. Experiments on plain classification, outlier detection, and dataset shift tasks show DAE to achieve robust performance across these tasks compared to the baselines, which tend to fail completely, when exposed to dataset shift. While DAE and the baselines yield rather uncalibrated predictions on the outlier detection and dataset shift task, we found that DAE calibration is more stable across all tasks. Therefore, calibration measures applied to the classification task could also improve the calibration of the outlier detection and dataset shift scenarios for DAE.","","978-1-6654-2099-0","10.1109/DSAA53316.2021.9564136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9564136","One vs Rest Classification;Outlier Detection;Dataset Shift","Training;Deep learning;Data science;Feature extraction;Robustness;Calibration;Risk management","","","","","","59","","20 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To prevent EDoS attacks, we propose an effective solution in the SDN-based cloud computing environment. We first introduce a machine-learning-based approach adopting a framework called MAD-GAN which applies an unsupervised multivariate anomaly detection technique based on Genera-tive Adversarial Networks (GANs), using the Long-Short-Term-Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNN) to detect EDoS attacks. Its main idea is to produce an anomaly score at each time step by learning a multivariate attribute. We then generate a dynamic threshold score to compare with the anomaly score produced to classify the network traffic as EDoS traffic or normal traffic. By realistic tests, our proposed scheme is demonstrated to outperform existing methods for EDoS attack detection. The detailed experiments conducted with different levels of EDoS attacks show that the proposed scheme is an efficient, innovative approach to defend EDoS attacks in the SDN-based cloud.","","978-1-7281-5471-8","10.1109/ICCE48956.2021.9352082","National Research Foundation of Korea; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9352082","Cloud computing security;economic denial of sustainability (EDoS);software-defined networking;machine learning;network function virtualization","Economics;Cloud computing;Recurrent neural networks;Telecommunication traffic;Sustainable development;Gallium nitride;Virtualization","cloud computing;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;recurrent neural nets;security of data","SDN-based cloud;economic denial;cloud computing;cost-effective platform;economic-denial-of-sustainability attack;cloud user;unexpected usage charge;EDoS attacks;machine-learning-based approach;MAD-GAN;unsupervised multivariate anomaly detection technique;Genera-tive Adversarial Networks;Long-Short-Term-Memory Recurrent Neural Networks;anomaly score;normal traffic;EDoS attack detection","","","","24","","16 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The performance of our model-based diagnostic scheme is tested on a class of adversarial scenarios based on a generalized fault/attack model.

To detect and identify attack threats from the heterogeneous cyber-physical information in the smart grid, this paper proposes an ensemble learning-based attack classifier using extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Compare with the popular single-classifier based approaches, the XG Boost-based attack classifier can effectively learn from the multi-sourced data to pinpoint attacks from normal and fault scenarios. Considering the potential imbalance of data samples among normal, fault, and attack samples, the paper also utilizes imbalance learning technique to boost the balance of data and subsequently the performance of XGboost. The proposed classifier is evaluated on a cyber-physical power system dataset collected from a high-fidelity hardware-in-the-loop smart grid testbed.

Web applications have opened up a variety of market possibilities by supplying consumers with a wide variety of digital technologies that benefit from high accessibility and functionality. Around the same time, web application protection continues to be an important challenge on the internet, and security must be taken seriously in order to secure confidential data. The threat is caused by inadequate validation of user input information, software developed without strict adherence to safety standards, vulnerability of reusable software libraries, software weakness, and so on. Through abusing a website's vulnerability, introduers are manipulating the user's information in order to exploit it for their own benefit. Then introduers inject their own malicious code, stealing passwords, manipulating user activities, and infringing on customers' privacy. As a result, information is leaked, applications malfunction, confidential data is accessed, etc. To mitigate the aforementioned issues, stacking ensemble based classifier model for Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack detection is proposed. Furthermore, the stacking ensembles technique is used in combination with different machine learning classification algorithms like k-Means, Random Forest and Decision Tree as base-learners to reliably detect XSS attack. Logistic Regression is used as meta-learner to predict the attack with greater accuracy. The classification algorithms in stacking model explore the problem in their own way and its results are given as input to the meta-learner to make final prediction, thus improving the overall detection accuracy of XSS attack in stacking than the individual models. The simulation findings demonstrate that the proposed model detects XSS attack successfully.","","978-1-6654-3587-1","10.1109/ICCES51350.2021.9489177","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9489177","Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack;k-Means clustering;Decision Tree;Random Forest;Stacking Ensembles;Logistic Regression;Classification;XSS payload","Uniform resource locators;Technological innovation;Software libraries;Cross-site scripting;Stacking;Predictive models;Classification algorithms","decision trees;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;software libraries;software reusability","stacking ensemble-based XSS attack detection strategy;classification algorithms;internet platforms;mobile platforms;digital technology innovations;web applications;market possibilities;digital technologies;high accessibility;web application protection;confidential data;inadequate validation;user input information;strict adherence;safety standards;vulnerability;reusable software libraries;software weakness;website;introduers;manipulating user activities;applications malfunction;stacking ensemble based classifier model;Cross-site scripting attack detection;stacking ensembles technique;base-learners;meta-learner;stacking model;detection accuracy","","","","22","","2 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As opposed to this, more recently, research has indicated the power of using the quantiles of the distributions because they are more robust and applicable for nonparametric methods. The estimation of the quantiles is even more pertinent when one is mining data streams. However, the complexity of quantile estimation is much higher than the corresponding estimation of the mean and variance, and this increased complexity is more relevant as the size of the data increases. Clearly, in the context of infinite data streams, a computational and space complexity that is linear in the size of the data is definitely not affordable. In order to alleviate the problem complexity, recently, a very limited number of studies have devised <i>incremental</i> quantile estimators [1], [2]. Estimators within this class resort to updating the quantile estimates based on the most recent observation(s), and this yields updating schemes with a very small computational footprint-a constant-time (i.e., <i>O</i>(1)) complexity. In this paper, we pursue this research direction and present an estimator that we refer to as a higher-fidelity frugal [1] quantile estimator. First, it guarantees a substantial advancement of the family of Frugal estimators introduced in [1]. The highlight of the present scheme is that it works in the discretized space, and it is thus a pioneering algorithm within the theory of discretized algorithms.1 The convergence results that we have proven are based on the theory of stochastic point location [3], which we advocate as a new tool for solving a large class of online estimation problems. Extensive simulation results show that our estimator outperforms the original Frugal algorithm in terms of both speed and accuracy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2820501","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8328812","Quantile estimation;stochastic point location;discetized estimation","Estimation;Aerospace electronics;Complexity theory;Robustness;Monitoring;Data mining;Convergence","computational complexity;data mining;estimation theory;learning (artificial intelligence);maximum likelihood estimation;pattern classification;random processes;stochastic processes;tree data structures","computational complexity;space complexity;stochastic point location;discretized space;higher-fidelity frugal quantile estimator;incremental discretized paradigm;frugal estimators;quantile estimates;incremental quantile estimators;problem complexity;computational space complexity;infinite data streams;increased complexity;variances;means;accurate quantile estimation;online estimation problems","","","","38","OAPA","30 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Interestingly, randomization has also been proposed to improve security of learning algorithms against evasion attacks, as it results in hiding information about the classifier to the attacker. Recent work has proposed game-theoretical formulations to learn secure classifiers, by simulating different evasion attacks and modifying the classification function accordingly. However, both the classification function and the simulated data manipulations have been modeled in a deterministic manner, without accounting for any form of randomization. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by proposing a randomized prediction game, namely, a noncooperative game-theoretic formulation in which the classifier and the attacker make randomized strategy selections according to some probability distribution defined over the respective strategy set. We show that our approach allows one to improve the tradeoff between attack detection and false alarms with respect to the state-of-the-art secure classifiers, even against attacks that are different from those hypothesized during design, on application examples including handwritten digit recognition, spam, and malware detection.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2593488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7533509","Adversarial learning;computer security;evasion attacks;game theory;pattern classification;randomization","Games;Generators;Malware;Cost function;Algorithm design and analysis;Training;Security","game theory;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;probability;statistical distributions","randomized prediction game;malware detection;malware code;byte sequences;game-theoretical formulations;secure classifiers;classification function;simulated data manipulations;noncooperative game-theoretic formulation;randomized strategy selections;attack detection;spam detection;evasion attacks;adversarial machine learning;malicious data obfuscation;attacker classifier;probability distribution","","14","","56","IEEE","4 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An accurate passive operating system (OS) fingerprinting plays a critical role in effective network management and cybersecurity protection. Passive fingerprinting does not send probes that introduce extra load to the network and hence it has a clear advantage over active fingerprinting since it also reduces the risk of triggering false alarms. This article proposes and evaluates an advanced classification approach to passive OS fingerprinting by leveraging state-of-the-art classical machine learning and deep learning techniques. Our controlled experiments on benchmark data, emulated, and realistic traffic is performed using two approaches. Through an Oracle-based machine learning approach, we found that the underlying TCP variant is an important feature for predicting the remote OS. Based on this observation, we develop a sophisticated tool for OS fingerprinting that first predicts the TCP flavor using passive traffic traces and then uses this prediction as an input feature for another machine learning algorithm for predicting the remote OS from passive measurements. This article takes the passive fingerprinting problem one step further by introducing the underlying predicted TCP variant as a distinguishing feature. In terms of accuracy, we empirically demonstrate that accurately predicting the TCP variant has the potential to boost the evaluation performance from 84% to 94% on average across all our validation scenarios and across different types of traffic sources. We also demonstrate a practical example of this potential, by increasing the performance to 91.2% and 95.3% on average using a tool for loss-based and delay-based TCP variants prediction in an emulated setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores the potential for using the knowledge of the TCP variant to significantly boost the accuracy of passive OS fingerprinting.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3024293","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9197712","Deep learning;fingerprinting;Internet of Things (IoT);machine learning;operating system (OS);passive traffic measurements","Machine learning;Security;TCPIP;Tools;Databases;Internet of Things;Fingerprint recognition","computer network security;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);operating systems (computers);telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","machine-learning-based tool;passive OS fingerprinting;complex enterprise network infrastructure;network traffic traces;accurate passive operating system fingerprinting;effective network management;cybersecurity protection;active fingerprinting;deep learning techniques;Oracle-based machine;TCP variant;remote OS;passive traffic traces;machine learning algorithm;passive measurements;passive fingerprinting problem one step;Internet of Things","","1","","57","IEEE","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The wheel speed is derived from a multitude of hall sensors. By generating an electromagnetic field with a fitting frequency it is possible to change the wheel speed sensor's interpretation of wheel speed. The braking system and electronic stability control would then base their actions on incorrect data possibly leading to a dangerous situation.

In healthcare, the collected data can monitor user emotion, behavior, and activity, which leads to the development of personalized decisions and improves lifestyle. In this paper, we analyzed the existing health fog framework and identified its limitations in terms of security, performance, and accuracy. Based on these limitations, we propose a secure health fog (SHF) framework that collects data from different Internet of Things (IoT) devices and maintains a personalized repository for adaptive model tuning. The adaptive model improves periodically based on user feedback and generates a personalized recommendation. Moreover, the existing IoT devices mostly rely on low-cost and low-power Zigbee technology, which is vulnerable to different attacks, such as device control, eavesdropping, fake device injection, malicious insider, man-in-the-middle, masquerading, message tampering, privacy leakage, and replay attack. Therefore, we propose a Zigbee Secure Health Fog (ZigbeeSHF) protocol, which uses symmetric and public-key cryptography to prevent these attacks. For data migration security, we concatenate the encrypted data with the encrypted digital signature to provide data authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality. To support our claims, we use the automated formal verification tools Scyther and AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications), which evaluate the protocols based on the threat model and exploits the vulnerabilities in different attacking environments. The results of both tools ensure prevention against the mentioned attacks. As a proof of concept, we also evaluate the accuracy and performance of our proposed framework in a smart studio apartment. The result shows that the adaptive model tuned for an individual user is very effective, and the average accuracy of 32.5% is improved after one month. Furthermore, the proposed ZigbeeSHF protocol requires 7.93% and 25.35% more computation time than Zigbee with and without installation code, respectively.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3101308","Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), South Korea, through the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) Support Program Supervised by the Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion (IITP)(grant numbers:IITP-2017-0-01629); IITP Grant by the Korean Government through MSIT(grant numbers:2017-0-00655); MSIT, South Korea, through the Grand Information Technology Research Center Support Program Supervised by the IITP(grant numbers:IITP-2021-2020-0-01489,NRF-2019R1A2C2090504); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9502075","Secure health fog;adaptive model tuning;personalized decision;security;Zigbee","Medical services;Edge computing;Sensors;Monitoring;Security;Protocols;Adaptation models","body sensor networks;computer network security;data privacy;digital signatures;distributed processing;health care;Internet of Things;private key cryptography;protocols;public key cryptography;telecommunication power management;Zigbee","encrypted digital signature;data authenticity;ZigbeeSHF protocol;adaptive model tuning;smart technology;secure health fog framework;data migration security;secure health fog;healthcare;SHF framework;Internet of Things devices;IoT devices;low-power Zigbee technology;device control attacks;eavesdropping;fake device injection attack;malicious insider attack;man-in-the-middle attack;masquerading attack;message tampering attack;privacy leakage attack;replay attack;Zigbee secure health fog protocol;symmetric key cryptography;public-key cryptography","","","","59","CCBY","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The reason is that the features targeted by the previous defense countermeasures are manually extracted, the range of it can't be large enough to cover the range of features automatically extracted by DL / ML-based attacks. This paper proposes a black box defense countermeasure based on decision boundary confusion. Instead of manually extracting features, it uses the classification results of the classifier to determine the decision boundary of the classifier then automatically find the adversarial traffic that may cause the classifier to be confused. At the same time, to solve the retraining problem caused by adversarial traffic, we also utilize Monte Carlo estimation to modify adversarial traffic, to confuse decision boundary, improve the retraining resistance of adversarial traffic. Therefore, it is difficult for the classifier to form a stable and effective decision boundary after training the adversarial traffic. Results shows that our method gets a average defense success rate of 78.2% when facing the baseline WF Attacks, outperforming existing SOTA method Walkie-Talkie's 63.6% average defense success rate. At the same time, our method improves the ability of the adversarial traffic to resist retrain, increased the retrain defense success rate from 12% to 78.2% under 31% overhead.","2642-7389","978-1-7281-8086-1","10.1109/ISCC50000.2020.9219633","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9219633","adversarial machine learning;website finger-printing;privacy;defense","","data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);Monte Carlo methods;pattern classification;Web sites","Web site fingerprint attack;decision-boundary confusion;machine learning;deep learning;black box defense countermeasure;decision boundary confusion;classifier;adversarial traffic;stable decision boundary;SOTA method;JumpEstimate;privacy-sensitive Web users;Monte Carlo estimation","","","","21","","12 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Aside from well-established honeypots, decoy elements, also known as honeytokens, are an excellent method to address various types of threats. Decoy elements are causing distraction and uncertainty to an attacker and help detecting malicious activity. Deception is meant to be complementing firewalls and intrusion detection systems. Particularly insider threats may be mitigated with deception methods. While current approaches consider the use of multiple decoy elements as well as context-sensitivity, they do not sufficiently describe a relationship between individual elements. In this work, inter-referencing decoy elements are introduced as a plausible extension to existing deception frameworks, leading attackers along a path of decoy elements. A theoretical foundation is introduced, as well as a stochastic model and a reference implementation. It was found that the proposed system is suitable to enhance current decoy frameworks by adding a further dimension of inter-connectivity and therefore improve intrusion detection and prevention.","","978-1-7281-6428-1","10.1109/CyberSecurity49315.2020.9138850","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9138850","information security;network security;cyberdeception;honeytokens;decoy elements","","security of data","deception technology;information systems;intrusion detection systems;deception methods;multiple decoy elements;inter-referencing decoy elements;deception frameworks;decoy frameworks","","","","31","","13 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, an anomaly-based intrusion detection scheme is proposed that can protect sensitive information and detect novel cyber-attacks. The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is used to train the Random Neural Network (RNN) based system (RNN-ABC). The proposed scheme is trained on NSL-KDD Train+ and tested for unseen data.

If such malware could intrude even into any of the IoT network, then even if the original malware instance get detected, by that time it can still infect the entire network. The IoT era also required Industry 4.0 grade AI based defense against such advanced malware. But AI algorithm need a lot of training data, and it is challenging to obtain training data for such evasive malware. Therefore, in this paper, we present ADVERSARIALuscator, a novel system that uses specialized (adversarial) deep reinforcement learning to obfuscate malware at the opcode level and create multiple metamorphic instances of the same. To the best of our knowledge, is the first-ever system that adopts the Markov Decision Process based approach to convert and find a solution to the problem of creating individual obfuscations at the opcode level. This is important as the machine language level is the least at which functionality could be preserved so as to mimic an actual attack effectively. is also the first-ever system to use efficient continuous action control capable deep reinforcement learning agents like the Proximal Policy Optimization in the area of cyber security. Experimental results indicate that could raise the metamorphic probability of a corpus of malware by ≥ 0.45. Additionally, more than 33% of metamorphic instances generated by were able to evade even the most potent IDS and penetrate the target system, even when the defending IDS could detect the original malware instance. Hence could be used to generate data representative of a swarm of very potent and coordinated AI based metamorphic malware attack. The so generated data and simulations could be used to bolster the defenses of an IDS against an actual AI based metamorphic attack from advanced malware and ransomware.","2161-4407","978-1-6654-3900-8","10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9534016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9534016","","Neural networks;Training data;Reinforcement learning;Markov processes;Malware;Generators;Data models","","","","","","32","","20 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection mechanism that takes advantage of Bloom filtering to test frame periodicity based on message identifiers and parts of the data-field which facilitates detection of potential replay or modification attacks. This proves to be an effective approach since most of the traffic from in-vehicle buses is cyclic in nature and the format of the data-field is fixed due to rigid signal allocation. Bloom filters provide an efficient time-memory tradeoff which is beneficial for the constrained resources of automotive grade controllers. We test the correctness of our approach and obtain good results on an industry-standard CANoe-based simulation for a J1939 commercial-vehicle bus and also on CAN with flexible data-rate traces obtained from a real-world high-end vehicle. The proposed filtering mechanism is straightforward to adapt for any other time-triggered in-vehicle bus, e.g., FlexRay, since it is built on time-driven characteristics.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2018.2869351","Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii(grant numbers:PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-1501 (2015–2017)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8457262","Intrusion detection;microcontrollers;network security","Intrusion detection;Proposals;Entropy;Standards;Resource management;Automotive engineering","automotive electronics;controller area networks;data structures;digital simulation;road vehicles;security of data","efficient intrusion detection;controller area network;cost efficiency;in-vehicle bus;numerous reported attacks;security solutions;intrusion detection mechanism;frame periodicity;message identifiers;data-field;potential replay;rigid signal allocation;Bloom filters;efficient time-memory tradeoff;automotive grade controllers;industry-standard CANoe-based simulation;J1939 commercial-vehicle bus;flexible data-rate traces;real-world high-end vehicle;filtering mechanism","","18","","46","IEEE","11 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, IoT devices are limited in computational power, including storage, processing, and communication resources, to effectively perform compute-intensive tasks locally. Edge computing resolves the resource limitation problems by bringing computation closer to the edge of IoT devices. Providing distributed edge nodes across the network reduces the stress of centralized computation and overcomes latency challenges in the IoT. Therefore, edge computing presents low-cost solutions for compute-intensive tasks. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) enables effective network management by presenting a global perspective of the network. While SDN was not explicitly developed for IoT challenges, it can, however, provide impetus to solve the complexity issues and help in efficient IoT service orchestration. The current IoT paradigm of massive data generation, complex infrastructures, security vulnerabilities, and requirements from the newly developed technologies make IoT realization a challenging issue. In this research, we provide an extensive survey on SDN and the edge computing ecosystem to solve the challenge of complex IoT management. We present the latest research on Software-Defined Internet of Things orchestration using Edge (SDIoT-Edge) and highlight key requirements and standardization efforts in integrating these diverse architectures. An extensive discussion on different case studies using SDIoT-Edge computing is presented to envision the underlying concept. Furthermore, we classify state-of-the-art research in the SDIoT-Edge ecosystem based on multiple performance parameters.

Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a novel approach that can automatically generate effective payload-based models purely based on the traffic of actual bot instances instead of signatures hand-tuned by human experts. In the learning phase, we group the packets of the botnet traffic and the benign traffic collected in advance according to their payload size and extract the signatures in the payload in order to generate the payload-based models. We then identify the high quality signatures to reduce the size of models via the information gain ratio and the probability. During the matching phase, the proposed approach uses these payload-based models to check each incoming packet. Moreover, these models can efficiently discriminate the malicious botnet traffic from the benign traffic since it doesn't perform any correlation between different packets. The proposed approach was evaluated with several real-world network traces. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect botnet traffic traces successfully (about 96.4%) with high efficiency and an acceptable low false alarm rate (about 0.9%).","","978-1-5090-1893-2","10.1109/SmartCity.2015.206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7463861","Botnet detection;Distributed denial-of-service;signature;payload-based models","Payloads;Servers;Computer crime;Databases;Computer architecture;Protocols;Load modeling","computer crime;digital signatures;feature extraction;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);modelling;probability","payload-based model;botnet detection;cybercrime;learning phase;signature identification;information gain ratio;probability","","","","20","","5 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Today, the increase in the use of standard protocols, hardware, and software in the SCADA systems that can connect to the internet and institutional networks causes these systems to become a target for more cyber-attacks. Intrusion detection systems are used to reduce or minimize cyber-attack threats. The use of deep learning-based intrusion detection systems also increases in parallel with the increase in the amount of data in the SCADA systems. The unsupervised feature learning present in the deep learning approaches enables the learning of important features within the large datasets. The features learned in an unsupervised way by using deep learning techniques are used in order to classify the data as normal or abnormal. Architectures such as convolutional neural network (CNN), Autoencoder (AE), deep belief network (DBN), and long short-term memory network (LSTM) are used to learn the features of SCADA data. These architectures use softmax function, extreme learning machine (ELM), deep belief networks, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) in the classification process. In this study, anomaly-based intrusion detection systems consisting of convolutional neural network, autoencoder, deep belief network, long short-term memory network, or various combinations of these methods on the SCADA networks in the literature were analyzed and the positive and negative aspects of these approaches were explained through their attack detection performances.","","978-1-6654-4058-5","10.1109/HORA52670.2021.9461273","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461273","SCADA;Industrial Control Systems;Deep Learning;Anomaly Detection;Feature Learning","Deep learning;Training;Extreme learning machines;SCADA systems;Intrusion detection;Computer architecture;Software","belief networks;computer network security;control engineering computing;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);industrial control;multilayer perceptrons;SCADA systems;security of data;unsupervised learning","deep belief network;long short-term memory network;SCADA networks;attack detection performances;anomaly detection approaches performed;deep learning methods;SCADA systems;supervisory control;industrial control systems;institutional networks;cyber-attack threats;deep learning-based intrusion detection systems;unsupervised feature learning;deep learning approaches;deep learning techniques;convolutional neural network;SCADA data;deep belief networks;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;classification process;CNN;DBN;LSTM;MLP;multilayer perceptron","","","","29","","25 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work proposes the use of a Mutual Information constrained Generative Adversarial Network as a means to synthesize new alerts from historical data. Histogram Intersection and Conditional Entropy are used to show the performance of this model as well as it's ability to learn intricate feature dependencies.

However, applications of ML algorithms have some reported weaknesses and in this research, we demonstrate how one of such weaknesses can be exploited against the workings of the IDS. The work presented in this paper is twofold: (1) we develop a ML approach for intrusion detection using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) network and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model with two different network-based IDS datasets; and (2) we perform a model evasion attack against the built MLP network for IDS using an adversarial machine learning technique known as the Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA) method. Our experimental results show that the model evasion attack is capable of significantly reducing the accuracy of the IDS, i.e., detecting malicious traffic as benign. Our findings support that neural network-based IDS is susceptible to model evasion attack, and attackers can essentially use this technique to evade intrusion detection systems effectively.","","978-1-7281-4085-8","10.1109/CISS48834.2020.1570617116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9086268","Adversarial Machine Learning;Evasion Attack;Intrusion Detection System;Neural Network","","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons","network defensive mechanism;Jacobian-based saliency map attack;network-based IDS datasets;adversarial machine learning;MLP network;multilayer perceptron network;malicious behavior;suspicious behavior;intrusion detection systems;model evasion attack","","5","","46","","7 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

GTID exploits information that is leaked as a result of heterogeneity in devices, which is a function of different device hardware compositions and variations in devices' clock skew. We apply statistical techniques on network traffic to create unique, reproducible device and device type signatures, and use artificial neural networks (ANNs) for classification. We demonstrate the efficacy of our technique on both an isolated testbed and a live campus network (during peak hours) using a corpus of 37 devices representing a wide range of device classes (e.g., iPads, iPhones, Google Phones, etc.) and traffic types (e.g., Skype, SCP, ICMP, etc.). Our experiments provided more than 300 GB of traffic captures which we used for ANN training and performance evaluation. In order for any fingerprinting technique to be practical, it must be able to detect previously unseen devices (i.e., devices for which no stored signature is available) and must be able to withstand various attacks. GTID is a fingerprinting technique to detect previously unseen devices and to illustrate its resilience under various attacker models.

To bypass the network security devices such as firewall, intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) and web application firewall, attackers use evasive techniques to circumvent them, of which protocol mimicry is a very useful approach. The technique camouflages malicious communications as common protocols or generally innocent applications to avoid network security audit, which has been widely used in advanced Trojans, botnets, as well as anonymous communication systems, bringing a great challenge to current network management and security. To this end, we propose a general network protocol mimicry behavior discovery framework named MimicHunter to detect such evasive masquerade behaviors, which exploits protocol structure and state transition verifications, as well as primary protocol behavior elements. Experiment results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in practice. Besides, MimicHunter is flexible in deployment and can be easily implemented in passive detection systems with only a little cost compared with the active methods.","","978-1-4673-7952-6","10.1109/Trustcom.2015.384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345292","protocol mimicry;intrusion detection;evasive attack;protocol structure;state transition","Protocols;MIMICs;Payloads;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Malware","security of data","MimicHunter framework;passive network protocol mimicry detection framework;network based intrusion;information theft events;network security devices;firewall;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;IDS-IPS;Web application firewall;evasive techniques;network security audit","","1","","31","","3 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One promising solution for countering this threat is to leverage deep learning (DL)-based text classification methods for fake-news detection. However, since such methods have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, the integrity and security of DL-based fake news classifiers are under question. Although many works study text classification under the adversarial threat, to the best of our knowledge, we do not find any work in literature that specifically analyzes the performance of DL-based fake-news detectors under adversarial settings. We bridge this gap by evaluating the performance of fake-news detectors under various configurations under black-box settings. In particular, we investigate the robustness of four different DL architectural choices - multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN) and a recently proposed Hybrid CNN-RNN trained on three different state-of-the-art datasets - under different adversarial attacks (Text Bugger, Text Fooler, PWWS, and Deep Word Bug) implemented using the state-of-the-art NLP attack library, Text-Attack. Additionally, we explore how changing the detector complexity, the input sequence length, and the training loss affect the robustness of the learned model. Our experiments suggest that RNNs are robust as compared to other architectures. Further, we show that increasing the input sequence length generally increases the detector's robustness.

Furthermore, our algorithm is multiplicative which makes it highly suitable to handle quantile estimation in systems in which the underlying distribution varies with time. Unlike Frugal and our legacy work which are randomized algorithms, we suggest deterministic updates where the step size is adjusted in a subtle manner to ensure the convergence. The deterministic algorithm is more efficient since the estimate is updated at every iteration. The convergence of the proposed estimator is proven using the theory of stochastic learning.

To date, machine learning technology has wide application in botnet detection because that it is able to summarize the features of existing attacks and generalize to never-before-seen botnet families. However, recent works in adversarial machine learning have shown that attackers are able to bypass the detection model by constructing specific samples, which due to many algorithms are vulnerable to almost imperceptible perturbations of their inputs. According to the degree of adversaries' knowledge about the model, adversarial attacks can be classified into several groups, such as gradient- and score-based attacks. In this paper, we propose a more general framework based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which effectively generates adversarial traffic flows to deceive the detection model by automatically adding perturbations to samples. Throughout the process, the target detector will be regarded as a black box and more close to realistic attack circumstance. A reinforcement learning agent is equipped for updating the adversarial samples by combining the feedback from the target model (i.e. benign or malicious) and the sequence of actions, which is able to change the temporal and spatial features of the traffic flows while maintaining the original functionality and executability. The experiment results show that the evasion rates of adversarial botnet flows are significantly improved. Furthermore, with the perspective of defense, this research can help the detection model spot its defect and thus enhance the robustness.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761337","","Botnet;Reinforcement learning;Feature extraction;Perturbation methods;Classification algorithms;Malware","Internet;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","botnet detection models;deep reinforcement learning;Internet security;machine learning technology;adversarial machine learning;adversarial attacks;score-based attacks;adversarial traffic;adversarial botnet;machine learning botnet detection models","","7","","26","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With support of information and communications technology, smart meters can be controlled and monitored remotely over the wireless broadband public network. Therefore, smart meters are vulnerable to cyber attacks due to connectivity and communication through the open space. In the worst case, intrusions into multiple meters can lead to severe cascading events, causing catastrophic dysfunction and wrong data generated by the meter. In this paper, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is proposed which contains host-based and network-based anomaly detection systems for the smart grid. The host-based anomaly detection considers temporal anomalies in the grid facilities, e.g., user-interfaces, access point to smart meters. The malicious behaviors of multicast messages, e.g., Sampled Measured Value (SMV), are incorporated in the proposed network-based anomaly detection. The proposed simultaneous intrusion detection method is able to identify the same type of attacks at multiple devices and their locations. The result is a new integrated tool for detection and mitigation of cyber intrusions at a single meter or multiple meters of a power grid.","","978-1-5090-5470-1","10.1109/SASG.2016.7849674","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7849674","Cybersecurity;Detection;Energy;Host-based;Intrusion;Meter;Network-based;Protocol;Smart;Theft","Smart meters;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Smart grids;Real-time systems;Privacy","power engineering computing;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids","cyber intrusions;SMV;sampled measured value;temporal anomalies;smart grid;host-based anomaly detection systems;network-based anomaly detection systems;IDS;smart meters;intrusion detection system","","","","17","","13 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On top of this architecture we propose a software stack and subsequently, an AI stack built on top of the software stack. While intelligence characteristics (learning, training, self-awareness, etc.) permeate all layers, we also separate AI-specific components into a separate layer for clear design. There are two aspects of AI in FCSs: a) AI embedded in the system to make the system better: better performing, more robust, self-healing, maintainable, repairable, and energy efficient. b) AI as the level of reasoning over the information contained within the system: the supervised and unsupervised techniques finding relationships over the data placed into the system. Developing the software and AI stack will require adapting to each redundant component. At least initially, specialization will be required. For this reason, starting with an interoperable, memory driven computing architecture and associated interconnect is essential for subsequent generalization. Our architecture is composable, i.e., it could be pursued in: a) its entirety, b) per-layer c) per component inside of the layer (e.g., only one of the accelerators, use cases, etc.); or d) exploring specific characteristics across the layers.","","978-1-7281-5221-9","10.1109/ICRC.2019.8914712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8914712","Memory Driven Computing;accelerators;AI","Artificial intelligence;Systems architecture;Software;Energy efficiency;Memory management;Hardware","data acquisition;learning (artificial intelligence);open systems;software architecture;storage management","FCS;hardware architecture;software stack;AI stack;future computing system;AI-specific components;interoperable memory driven computing architecture;memory driven computing AI architecture;next generation accelerator;Gen-Z interconnect","","1","","31","","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is followed by the analysis of their causes: users' weak awareness of information security, the under-developed laws and regulations concerning the security of personal information, the laggard technology for security maintenance of big data, and motivations for profits. In order to solve these problems, firstly, the awareness of information security and users' ability of security maintenance should be strengthened. In addition, the security management system of big data should be improved with deepening reform of security technology. Furthermore, legislation and regulation system should be reinforced.

DIFT tracks suspicious information flows in the system and generates security analysis when anomalous behavior is detected. A system threatened by attackers of different capabilities demands simultaneous analysis of multiple flows. As the number of information flows in a system is typically large and the amount of resource required for analyzing different flows varies, an optimal allocation of the limited resources available to DIFT is essential. We address the problem of detecting multiple attackers using resource constrained DIFT and develop a model that captures the interaction of adversaries and a DIFT-based defender as a multi-player dynamic game. Our model consists of a multi-stage game, in which each stage represents the subset of processes in the system that correspond to the locations of the information flows, and captures the notion of benign flows. Given the attackers' strategies, we prove that finding an optimal defense strategy is equivalent to maximizing an increasing DR-submodular function that enables us to propose an approximation algorithm. Further, given a defense strategy and strategies of other attackers, we show that finding an optimal attacker strategy is equivalent to solving a shortest path problem, where the edge weights are derived from the strategies of the other players. Based on this mapping we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for computing an optimal attacker strategy. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm on a real-world dataset of a nation state attack obtained using the Refinable Attack INvestigation (RAIN) framework.","2576-2370","978-1-7281-1398-2","10.1109/CDC40024.2019.9029836","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9029836","","Games;Resource management;Computer security;Approximation algorithms;Computational modeling;Memory management","computational complexity;computer network security;game theory;optimisation","optimal defense strategy;optimal attacker strategy;multistage game;multiplayer dynamic game;DIFT-based defender;resource constrained DIFT;optimal allocation;different flows varies;multiple flows;security analysis;DIFT tracks suspicious information;computer systems;cyber attacks;multiple attackers;dynamic Information Flow Tracking games;refinable attack investigation framework;nation state attack","","","","17","","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An important part of fuzzing test is the fuzzing data generation. Numerous traditional methods to generate fuzzing data have been developed, such as model-based fuzzing data generation and random fuzzing data generation. These techniques require the specification of the input data format or analyze the input data format by manual reverse engineering. In this paper, we introduce an approach using Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGANs), a deep adversarial learning method, to generate fuzzing data. This method does not require defining the input data format. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use a WGAN-based method to generate fuzzing data. Industrial security has been an important and pressing issue globally. Network protocol fuzzing plays a significant role in ensuring the safety and reliability of industrial control systems (ICSs). Thus, the proposed method is significant for ICS testing. In the experiment, we use an industrial control protocol such as the Modbus-TCP protocol and EtherCAT protocol as our test target. Results indicate that this approach is more intelligent and capable than the methods used in previous studies. In addition, owing to its design, this model can be trained within a short time, which is computationally light and practical.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2911121","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602178); Shanghai Science and Technology Committee Rising-Star Program(grant numbers:18QB1402000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8691434","Automated vulnerability mining;deep adversarial learning;fuzzing;security testing;industrial security;industrial control protocol;protocol format learning","Fuzzing;Protocols;Data models;Industrial control;Deep learning;Training;Gallium nitride","control engineering computing;industrial control;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;production engineering computing;program testing;protocols;security of data","Wasserstein generative adversarial networks;deep adversarial learning method;input data format;WGAN-based method;network protocol fuzzing;intelligent fuzzing data generation method;fuzzing test;model-based fuzzing data generation;fuzz testing;Modbus-TCP protocol;EtherCAT protocol;ICS testing;industrial control systems;industrial security;security vulnerabilities","","4","","70","OAPA","14 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The algorithms demand a large number of heterogeneous data sources to train and validate new security systems. This paper presents the description of new datasets, the so-called ToN_IoT, which involve federated data sources collected from Telemetry datasets of IoT services, Operating system datasets of Windows and Linux, and datasets of Network traffic. The paper introduces the testbed and description of TON_IoT datasets for Windows operating systems. The testbed was implemented in three layers: edge, fog and cloud. The edge layer involves IoT and network devices, the fog layer contains virtual machines and gateways, and the cloud layer involves cloud services, such as data analytics, linked to the other two layers. These layers were dynamically managed using the platforms of software-Defined Network (SDN) and Network-Function Virtualization (NFV) using the VMware NSX and vCloud NFV platform. The Windows datasets were collected from audit traces of memories, processors, networks, processes and hard disks. The datasets would be used to evaluate various AI-based cyber security solutions, including intrusion detection, threat intelligence and hunting, privacy preservation and digital forensics. This is because the datasets have a wide range of recent normal and attack features and observations, as well as authentic ground truth events.

The novelty of this work is the redundancy in detecting agents, their evaluation based on the majority voting and the calculation of the reputation as the average value, which makes it more robust to different attack scenarios and their parameter variations. The algorithms use the feature space based on sequences of sensor outputs (both temporal and spatial), as well as the routing paths used to forward the data to the base station, and designed with the idea of introducing the ability to detect a wide range of attacks.

We introduce and explore a new privacy notion for location histograms, in which the user chooses a target histogram that she wants to avoid or to resemble by obfuscating her location visits. For example, she may want to avoid looking wealthy or to resemble a health conscious person. We describe how to design concrete privacy mechanisms that operate under different assumptions on e.g. the user's mobility, including provably optimal mechanisms. We use a mobility dataset with 1083 users to illustrate how these mechanisms achieve privacy while minimizing the quality loss caused by the location obfuscation, in the context of two types of Location-Based Services: nearest-PoI, and geofence.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2020.2980270","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9035624","Location privacy;Optimization;Histograms","Privacy;Histograms;Companies;Insurance;Trajectory;Differential privacy","","","","","","","IEEE","13 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The recent application of deep learning approaches for network intrusion detection has shown promising. However, the challenges remain on how to deal with imbalance data and small samples as well as reducing false alarm rate (FAR). To address these issues, this work has proposed a multiple-layer representation learning model for accurate end-to-end network intrusion detection by combining deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) with gcForest. The contributions of this work lie in 1) a new data encoding scheme based on P-Zigzag to encode network traffic data into two-dimensional gray-scale images for representation learning without loss of original information; 2) The combination of gcForest and CNN allows accurate detection on imbalanced data and small scale data with fewer hyperparamters comparing to most existing deep learning models, which increase computational efficiency. The proposed approach is based on a multiple-layer approach consisting of a coarse layer and a fine layer, in which the coarse layer with the improved CNN model (GoogLeNetNP) focuses on identification of N abnormal classes and a normal class. While in the fine layer, an improved model based on gcForest (caXGBoost) further classifies the abnormal classes into N-1 subclasses. This ensures fine-grained detection of various attacks. The proposed framework has been compared with the existing deep learning models using three real datasets (a new dataset NBC, a combination of UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS2017 consisting of 101 classes). The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms other single deep learning methods (i.e., AlexNet, VGG19, GoogleNet, InceptionV3, ResNet18) in terms of accuracy, detection rate, and FAR, which demonstrates its effectiveness in detecting fine-grained attacks and handling imbalanced datasets with high-precision and low FAR.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2927465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8758106","Network intrusion detection;convolutional neural networks;deep random forests;representation learning","Intrusion detection;Feature extraction;Forestry;Deep learning;Data models","convolutional neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","improved CNN model;fine-grained attacks;multiple-layer representation;network-based attack detection;network-based attacks;information systems;deep convolutional neural networks;gcForest;gray-scale images;representation learning;deep learning methods;end-to-end network intrusion detection;data encoding scheme;P-Zigzag","","3","","55","CCBY","9 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We design and implement a novel framework called FlowIntent to detect nonfunctional transmissions at both software and network levels.

Experimental results on synthetic and public traffic show that our AE-D3F can not only achieve 82.00% detection rate (DR) with 0 false positive rate (FPR), better than classical anomaly detection approaches, but also detect novel and unknown attacks.","2374-9709","978-1-7281-4973-8","10.1109/NOMS47738.2020.9110372","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9110372","Machine Learning;Anomaly Detection;Deep Learning;DDoS","","computer network security;neural nets;telecommunication traffic","normal attack data;building detection models;AutoEncoder;anomaly detection;DDoS attacks detection framework;distributed denial of service attack detection;network security","","2","","33","","8 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among many applications of inter-connected systems, vehicular networks and smart cars are examples that are already rolled out. Smart vehicles not only have networks connecting their internal components e.g. via Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, but also are connected to the outside world through road side units and other vehicles. In some cases, the internal and external network packets pass through the same hardware and are merely isolated by software defined rules. Any misconfiguration opens a window for the hackers to intrude into vehicles' internal components e.g. central lock system, Engine Control Unit (ECU), Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) or Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system. Compromise of any of these can lead to disastrous outcomes. In this paper, we study the security of smart vehicles' adaptive cruise control systems in the presence of covert attacks. We define two covert/stealth attacks in the context of cruise control and propose a novel intrusion detection and compensation method to disclose and respond to such attacks. More precisely, we focus on the covert cyber attacks that compromise the integrity of cruise controller and employ a neural network identifier in the IDS engine to estimate the system output dynamically and compare it against the ACC output. If any anomaly is detected, an embedded substitute controller kicks in and takes over the control. We conducted extensive experiments in MATLAB to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in a simulated environment.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3053406","Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM)(grant numbers:CS1398-4-199); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9349140","Internet of vehicles;cyber physical systems;software defined networks;vehicular ad hoc networks;car cruise control;intrusion detection;covert attack","Lead;Security;Cruise control;Acceleration;Intrusion detection;Automobiles;Vehicle dynamics","adaptive control;braking;control engineering computing;controller area networks;Internet of Things;Matlab;networked control systems;road vehicles;security of data;traffic engineering computing","adaptive cruise control systems;cyber attacks;neural network identifier;embedded substitute controller kicks;networked control systems;smart vehicle;Internet of Vehicles paradigm;unprecedented security challenges;inter-connected systems;vehicular networks;smart cars;controller area network bus;internal network packets;external network packets;engine control unit;anti-lock braking system;Matlab","","1","","36","IEEE","5 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) at distribution and transmission layers of the smart grid provide high velocity real time information on voltage and current magnitudes and angles in a three phase electrical grid. Naturally, the authenticity of the PMU data is of utmost operational importance. Data falsification attacks on PMU data can cause the Energy Management Systems (EMS) to take wrong decisions, potentially having drastic consequences on the power grid's operation. The need for an automated data falsification attack detection and isolation is key for EMS protection from PMU data falsification. In this paper, we propose an automated distributed stream mining approach to time series anomaly based attack detection that identifies attacks while distinguishing from legitimate changes in PMU data trends. Specifically, we provide a real time learning invariant that reduces the multi-dimensional nature of the PMU data streams for quick big data summarization using a Pythagorean means of the active power from a cluster of PMUs. Thereafter, we propose a methodology that learns thresholds of the invariant automatically, to prove the predictive power of distinguishing between small attacks versus legitimate changes. Extensive simulation results using real PMU data are provided to verify the accuracy of the proposed method.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9322072","NSF(grant numbers:SaTC-2030611,OAC-2017289,SaTC-2030624); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9322072","Smart Grid Security;Phasor Measurement Units Security;Big Data Management;Anomaly Detection","Phasor measurement units;Anomaly detection;Real-time systems;Monitoring;Training;Phase measurement;Current measurement","Big Data;data mining;energy management systems;power system measurement;real-time systems;reliability;smart power grids;state estimation;time series","EMS;real time learning invariant;voltage magnitudes;Big Data summarization;PMU data streams;time series anomaly based attack detection;automated distributed stream mining approach;PMU data falsification;automated data falsification attack detection;power grid;energy management systems;data falsification attacks;phase electrical grid;current magnitudes;transmission layers;phasor measurement units;state estimation;smart grid;distribution level PMUs","","","","14","","25 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Developments concerning the IoT and CPS will improve critical infrastructure, vehicle networks, and personal health products. Unfortunately, these systems are vulnerable to attack. Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are a class of long-term attacks in which well-resourced adversaries infiltrate a network and use obfuscation to remain undetected. In a CPS under APTs, each device must decide whether to trust other components that may be compromised. In this paper, we propose a concept of trust (strategic trust) that uses game theory to capture the adversarial and strategic nature of CPS security. Specifically, we model an interaction between the administrator of a cloud service, an attacker, and a device that decides whether to trust signals from the vulnerable cloud. Our framework consists of a simultaneous signaling game and the FlipIt game. The equilibrium outcome in the signaling game determines the incentives in the FlipIt game. In turn, the equilibrium outcome in the FlipIt game determines the prior probabilities in the signaling game. The Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE) characterizes the steady state of the overall macro-game. The novel contributions of this paper include proofs of the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the GNE. We also apply GNEs to strategically design a trust mechanism for a cloud-assisted insulin pump. Without requiring the use of historical data, the GNE obtains a risk threshold beyond which the pump should not trust messages from the cloud. Our framework contributes to a modeling paradigm called games-of-games.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2017.2725224","National Science Foundation IGERT grant through the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies in Security and Privacy, New York University(grant numbers:CNS-1544782); National Science Foundation IGERT grant through the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies in Security and Privacy, New York University(grant numbers:EFRI-1441140); National Science Foundation IGERT grant through the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies in Security and Privacy, New York University(grant numbers:SES-1541164); Department of Energy(grant numbers:DE-NE0008571); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7972976","Internet of things;cyber-physical systems;trust;cyber-security;signaling game;perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium","Games;Security;Game theory;Cloud computing;Sugar;Stability analysis;Monitoring","cloud computing;cyber-physical systems;game theory;trusted computing","strategic trust;cloud-enabled cyber-physical systems;glucose control;Internet of Things;IoT;CPS;advanced persistent threats;APT;simultaneous signaling game;FlipIt game;Gestalt Nash equilibrium;GNE;trust mechanism;cloud-assisted insulin pump","","17","","49","IEEE","11 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One approach to malware classification is Static Analysis - a form of analysis which does not require malware to be executed before classification can be performed. For this reason, a lightweight classifier based on the features of a malware binary is preferred, with relatively low computational overhead. In this work a modified convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was deployed which integrated a complexity-based evaluation based on box-counting. This was implemented by setting up max-pooling layers in parallel, and then extracting the fractal dimension using a polyscalar relationship based on the resolution of the measurement scale and the number of elements of a malware image covered in the measurement under consideration. To test the robustness and efficacy of our approach we trained and tested on over 9300 malware binaries from 25 unique malware families. This work was compared to other award-winning image recognition models, and results showed categorical accuracy in excess of 96.54%.","","978-1-7281-7624-6","10.1109/CSCI51800.2020.00008","Mitacs; University of Manitoba; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9457954","Complexity;Convolutional Neural Network;Malware Classification;Image Processing;Machine Learning","Scientific computing;Computer architecture;Static analysis;Feature extraction;Malware;Fractals;Robustness","computer viruses;fractals;image classification;image recognition;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification","malware image;9300 malware binaries;25 unique malware families;complexity-based convolutional neural network;malware classification;metamorphic malware;anti-virus vendors;firms;malware binary;modified convolutional neural network architecture;integrated a complexity-based evaluation","","","","44","","23 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Masquerade detection is one of the key problems of intrusion detection systems. Deep learning models that obtained state-of-the-art results in masquerade detection have failed to exhibit very high detection performance when data samples contain limited information. Alternatively, computationally cheaper and more memory-efficient traditional machine learning models suffer from less robust features, which hinders them in achieving high detection performance. The contributions of this article are as follows: we introduce new features of variable-length UNIX command sequences (i.e., weighted occurrence frequencies of different orders) and integrate these features into an extended Markov-chain-based variable-length model. The detection performance of our model is evaluated on three publicly available and free datasets: Schonlau (SEA), Purdue (PU), and Greenberg. The results demonstrate that our model significantly improves the true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate, receiver operator characteristic, and threshold variance compared to the baselines (other Markov-chain-based variable-length models). Furthermore, in terms of the TPR, the proposed method is superior to a state-of-the-art deep learning model that uses a convolutional neural network on the PU and Greenberg datasets and a state-of-the-art sequence-alignment-hidden Markov model on the SEA dataset. Moreover, the proposed method is much more lightweight than the state-of-the-art models in terms of computational and memory complexity, and thus more suitable for real-time masquerade detection.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3039166","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:91118002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9262847","Anomaly detection;intrusion detection;machine learning (ML);Markov chain;masquerade detection;UNIX commands","Hidden Markov models;Computational modeling;Data models;Markov processes;Feature extraction;Memory management;Anomaly detection","convolutional neural nets;hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;statistical analysis;Unix","high detection performance;computationally cheaper memory-efficient;robust features;command sequences;extended Markov-chain-based variable-length model;publicly available datasets;free datasets;false positive rate;Markov-chain-based variable-length models;state-of-the-art deep learning model;state-of-the-art sequence-alignment-hidden Markov model;real-time masquerade detection;masquerade attacks;variable-length sequences;masquerader;illegitimate access;intrusion detection systems;deep learning models;state-of-the-art results;SEA;Schonlau;Purdue;Greenberg;PU;TPR","","","","45","CCBY","18 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
