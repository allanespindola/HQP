These cyber attacks often can not be detected by classical information security methods. Moreover, the consequences of cyber attack's impact can be catastrophic. Since cyber attacks leads to appearance of anomalies in the ICS and technological equipment controlled by it, the task of intrusion detection for ICS can be reformulated as the task of industrial process anomaly detection. This paper considers the applicability of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in the field of industrial processes anomaly detection. Existing approaches for GANs usage in the field of information security (such as anomaly detection in network traffic) were described. It is proposed to use the BiGAN architecture in order to detect anomalies in the industrial processes. The proposed approach has been tested on Secure Water Treatment Dataset (SWaT). The obtained results indicate the prospects of using the examined method in practice.","","978-1-7281-8075-5","10.1109/GloSIC50886.2020.9267878","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9267878","information security;industrial control systems (ICS);deep learning;generative adversarial networks (GAN)","Generators;Generative adversarial networks;Training;Computer architecture;Data models;Anomaly detection;Integrated circuit modeling","control engineering computing;industrial control;neural nets;production engineering computing;security of data","industrial process;generative adversarial networks;industrial control systems;ICS;cyber attacks;intrusion detection;industrial processes anomaly detection;BiGAN architecture","","2","","22","","30 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These calls would not only exasperate recipients with the unwanted ringing, impacting their productivity, but also lead to a direct financial loss to users and service providers. Telecommunication Service Providers (TSPs) often employ standalone detection systems to classify call originators as spammers or non-spammers using their behavioral patterns. These approaches perform well when spammers target a large number of recipients of one service provider. However, professional spammers try to evade the standalone systems by intelligently reducing the number of spam calls sent to one service provider, and instead distribute calls to the recipients of many service providers. Naturally, collaboration among service providers could provide an effective defense, but it brings the challenge of privacy protection and system resources required for the collaboration process. In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized collaborative system named privy for the effective blocking of spammers who target multiple TSPs. More specifically, we develop a system that aggregates the feedback scores reported by the collaborating TSPs without employing any trusted third party system, while preserving the privacy of users and collaborators. We evaluate the system performance of privy using both the synthetic and real call detail records. We find that privy can correctly block spammers in a quicker time, as compared to standalone systems. Further, we also analyze the security and privacy properties of the privy system under different adversarial models.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2017.2771251","ERC(grant numbers:306994); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8103809","Privacy preservation;telephony spam;decentralized collaboration;secure multi-party computation","Collaboration;Privacy;Cryptography;Protocols;Telephony;Electronic mail","computer network security;data privacy;unsolicited e-mail","privy;privacy preserving collaboration;multiple service providers;recipients;telecommunication service providers;standalone detection systems;spammers;collaborative system;TSPs;spam calls;telecom spams","","3","","51","IEEE","10 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Intrusion detection, which is an indispensable part of a security system, is also included in these studies. In order to explore the complex characteristics of IoT, machine learning methods, which rely on long training time to generate intrusion detection models, are proposed in the literature. Furthermore, these systems need to learn a new/fresh model from scratch when the environment changes. This study explores the use of transfer learning in order to generate intrusion detection algorithms for such dynamically changing IoT. Transfer learning is an approach that stores knowledge learned from a problem domain/task and applies that knowledge to another problem domain/task. Here, it is employed in the following two settings: transferring knowledge for generating suitable intrusion algorithms for new devices, transferring knowledge for detecting new types of attacks. In this study, Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Network (RPL), a routing protocol for resource-constrained wireless networks, is used as an exemplar protocol and specific attacks against RPL are targeted. The experimental results show that the transfer learning approach gives better performance than the traditional approach. Moreover, the proposed approach significantly reduces learning time, which is an important factor for putting devices/networks in operation in a timely manner. Even though transfer learning has been considered a potential candidate for improving IoT security, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of transfer learning under these two settings in RPL-based IoT networks.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2021.3096029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9478846","IoT;security;transfer learning;intrusion detection;genetic programming;RPL","Transfer learning;Intrusion detection;Statistics;Sociology;Internet of Things;Task analysis;Genetic programming","Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);routing protocols;telecommunication security","routing protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Network;RPL-based IoT networks;IoT security;resource-constrained wireless networks;intrusion detection algorithms;intrusion detection models;machine learning methods;security system;Internet of Things security;resource-constrained IoT devices;transfer learning approach","","","","43","IEEE","9 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present different adversarial patches that misguide the prediction of DNN models and change the cause of prediction results of interpretation models, such as gradient-weighted class activation mapping. The proposed adversarial patches have appropriate location and perturbation ratios, which comprise visible or less visible adversarial patches. In addition, image patches within small arrays are localized without covering or overlapping with any of the main objects in a natural image. In particular, we generate two adversarial patches that cover only 3% and 1.5% of the pixels in the original image, while they do not cover the main objects in the natural image. Our experiments are performed using four pre-trained DNN models and the ImageNet dataset. We also examine the inaccurate results of the interpretation models through mask and heatmap visualization.

Alongside the features introduced within this new concept, the PEDG is more prone to cyber-physical malicious activities because of the distributed communication infrastructure and accessibility of the resources. Some of these malicious activities e.g., stealthy attacks, are unobservable for the supervisory system until the control system diverges. Some of these attacks might result in loss of DER generation that could cause frequency deviations beyond permissible boundaries specified by the DERs’ grid integration standards. To fulfill frequency restoration in the event of stealthy attacks, this paper proposes an artificial-intelligence-based shadow control for inverter-interfaced DERs to improve the grid’s resiliency. During the normal operation of the PEDG, all DERs inject active power considering various criteria including, maximum available power, state of the charge, rate of power reserve, etc. As an unusual deviation on the frequency or its rate of change occurs, the artificial-intelligence-inspired shadow control of the grid cluster is activated to re-balance active power across the grid within a short timeframe while slow-response synchronous generators are trying to catch up. The ANN module of the proposed shadow control provides accurate feedbacks for the DER controller to support the grid frequency for any potential disturbances. The proposed shadow control framework is verified on a 14-bus PEDG system.","2329-3748","978-1-7281-5135-9","10.1109/ECCE47101.2021.9595863","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9595863","artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;power electronics dominated grid;frequency restoration;shadow control","Time-frequency analysis;Control systems;Synchronous generators;Power electronics;Real-time systems;Frequency synchronization;Relays","","","","","","23","","16 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Attacks against CDN edge-servers can lead to loss in revenue and reputation. Attacks are becoming more sophisticated, and new attacks are being introduced constantly. In our previous work, we developed a security orchestration system driven by high-level security policies to dynamically deploy mitigation services. In this system, security policies are triggered at the occurrence of low-level alerts that correspond to misuse of an edge-server's resources. However, a network operator must know the effects of any attack on resources to deploy an appropriate mitigation service. Moreover, pin-pointing the actual cause (e.g., malicious IPs) of resource misuse is challenging. Also, edge-server's resources may not be affected by some attacks.Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, we extend our system to detect new and sophisticated attacks. The goal is to enable the network operator to specify higher-level security policies without worrying about analyzing low-level resource usage alerts. Further, policy enforcement can trigger the deployment of mitigation services only for malicious entities identified by the alerts. In this perspective, we propose a Hybrid Classification Clustering (HCC) method that not only detects known sophisticated attacks accurately (with 99.9% detection recall) but is capable of detecting new attacks (with 56.4% detection recall). Further, to improve the detection rate of new attacks and anomalies, we propose an Autoencoder-based Network Anomaly Detection (ANAD) method using a fully-connected autoencoder model.

Its fingerprinting engine exploits a unique observation to extract probing activities from darknet traffic. The system's inference engine employs a set of behavioral analytics to generate numerous significant insights related to the machinery of the probing sources while its analysis engine exploits the previously obtained inferences to automatically infer the campaigns. CSC-Detector is empirically evaluated and validated using 240 GB of real darknet data. The outcome discloses 3 recent, previously unreported large-scale probing campaigns targeting diverse Internet services. Further, one of those inferred campaigns revealed that the sipscan campaign that was initially analyzed by CAIDA is arguably still active, yet operating in a stealthy, very low rate mode. We envision that the proposed system that is tailored towards darknet data, which is frequently, abundantly and effectively used to generate cyber threat intelligence, could be used by network security analysts, emergency response teams and/or observers of cyber events to infer large-scale orchestrated probing campaigns.

In FANET, the UAV clients are vulnerable to various malicious attacks such as the jamming attack. The aerial adversaries in the jamming attack disrupt the communication of the victim network through interference on the receiver side. Jamming attack detection in FANET poses new challenges for its key differences from other ad-hoc networks. First, because of the varying communication range and power consumption constraints, any centralized detection system becomes trivial in FANET. Second, the existing decentralized solutions, disregarding the unbalanced sensory data from new spatial environments, are unsuitable for the highly mobile and spatially heterogeneous UAVs in FANET. Third, given a huge number of UAV clients, the global model may need to choose a sub-group of UAV clients for providing a timely global update. Recently, federated learning has gained attention, as it addresses unbalanced data properties besides providing communication efficiency, thus making it a suitable choice for FANET. Therefore, we propose a federated learning-based on-device jamming attack detection security architecture for FANET. We enhance the proposed federated learning model with a client group prioritization technique leveraging the Dempster-Shafer theory. The proposed client group prioritization mechanism allows the aggregator node to identify better client groups for calculating the global update. We evaluated our mechanism with datasets from publicly available standardized jamming attack scenarios by CRAWDAD and the ns-3 simulated FANET architecture and showed that, in terms of accuracy, our proposed solution (82.01% for the CRAWDAD dataset and 89.73% for the ns-3 simulated FANET dataset) outperforms the traditional distributed solution (49.11% for the CRAWDAD dataset and 65.62% for the ns-3 simulated FANET dataset).

In this paper, we demonstrate that using IoT-specific network behaviors (e.g., limited number of endpoints and regular time intervals between packets) to inform feature selection can result in high accuracy DDoS detection in IoT network traffic with a variety of machine learning algorithms, including neural networks. These results indicate that home gateway routers or other network middleboxes could automatically detect local IoT device sources of DDoS attacks using low-cost machine learning algorithms and traffic data that is flow-based and protocol-agnostic.","","978-1-5386-8276-0","10.1109/SPW.2018.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8424629","Internet of Things;Anomaly Detection;DDoS;Machine Learning;Feature Engineering","Anomaly detection;Computer crime;Internet of Things;Botnet;Middleboxes;Machine learning","computer network security;Internet;Internet of Things;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","critical Internet infrastructure;consumer IoT attack traffic;IoT network traffic;machine learning algorithms;neural networks;network middleboxes;DDoS attacks;DDoS detection;Consumer Internet of Things Devices;distributed denial of service attacks;consumer IoT devices","","103","","24","","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Deep learning has been proven to be effective in modelling underlying distributions of input training data. However, the existing deep learning-based methods normally focus on how to alleviate the negative impact from the presence of outliers when they model the full dataset. Besides, insufficient size of training data also leads to unsatisfactory training of deep networks. This paper proposes a WGAN-empowered deep Autoencoder-based Outlier detection approach (GAEO for short) which presents a novel way to directly and effectively model reliable normal data. GAEO first obtains initial normal data by a proposed initial distance-based outlier scoring function, then constructs a WGAN network to perform normal data augmentation to obtain adequate training samples for subsequent normal data modelling. The deep autoencoder is then trained to discover and yield distributions and patterns of normal data, and the reconstruction error is defined as outlierness of each data object. In our experiments, we investigate the effectiveness of our method GAEO compared with three state-of-the-art outlier detectors on ten real-world datasets, and discuss the impact of the parameters in GAEO. We show that our method GAEO significantly outperforms its contenders by 4% to 20% AUC improvement.","2377-844X","978-1-7281-1190-2","10.1109/ICEIEC.2019.8784627","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8784627","outlier detection;deep autoencoder;deep learning;GAN","Data models;Anomaly detection;Training data;Gallium nitride;Reliability;Training;Deep learning","data handling;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern clustering","deep learning;WGAN-empowered deep autoencoder-based outlier detection approach;GAEO;outlier detection approach;normal data modelling;distance-based outlier scoring function;data object;normal data augmentation;WGAN network;deep networks","","","","15","","5 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, we investigate how a forward secure logging mechanism can be used for intrusion detection and prevention purposes in such cases. The proposed defense mechanism can be summarized in security-related information gathering and fast forward-secure logging by an intrusion detection agent, in addition to log analysis, incident identification and response by a trusted server. We implemented our proposal on the OpenPLC framework as the proof of concept and we show how our proposed scheme can be effective in order to detect and prevent adversaries from running arbitrary code on the controllers.

By minimizing the size and number of these patches, the attacker can reduce the amount of network communication and memory overwrites, with minimal risk of system malfunctions or other detectable side effects. We demonstrate the feasibility of this attack by computing efficient patches on multiple deep learning models.

The IoUT technology is intricately linked with intelligent boats and ships, smart shores and oceans, automatic marine transportations, positioning and navigation, underwater exploration, disaster prediction and prevention, as well as with intelligent monitoring and security. The IoUT has an influence at various scales ranging from a small scientific observatory, to a mid-sized harbor, and to covering global oceanic trade. The network architecture of IoUT is intrinsically heterogeneous and should be sufficiently resilient to operate in harsh environments. This creates major challenges in terms of underwater communications, whilst relying on limited energy resources. Additionally, the volume, velocity, and variety of data produced by sensors, hydrophones, and cameras in IoUT is enormous, giving rise to the concept of Big Marine Data (BMD), which has its own processing challenges. Hence, conventional data processing techniques will falter, and bespoke Machine Learning (ML) solutions have to be employed for automatically learning the specific BMD behavior and features facilitating knowledge extraction and decision support. The motivation of this article is to comprehensively survey the IoUT, BMD, and their synthesis. It also aims for exploring the nexus of BMD with ML. We set out from underwater data collection and then discuss the family of IoUT data communication techniques with an emphasis on the state-of-the-art research challenges. We then review the suite of ML solutions suitable for BMD handling and analytics. We treat the subject deductively from an educational perspective, critically appraising the material surveyed. Accordingly, the reader will become familiar with the pivotal issues of IoUT and BMD processing, whilst gaining an insight into the state-of-the-art applications, tools, and techniques. Finally, we analyze the architectural challenges of the IoUT, followed by proposing a range of promising direction for research and innovation in the broad areas of IoUT and BMD. Our hope is to inspire researchers, engineers, data scientists, and governmental bodies to further progress the field, to develop new tools and techniques, as well as to make informed decisions and set regulations related to the maritime and underwater environments around the world.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2021.3053118","Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L182032); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/N004558/1,EP/P034284/1,EP/P034284/1,EP/P003990/1 (COALESCE)); Royal Society’s Global Challenges Research Fund Grant; European Research Council’s Advanced Fellow Grant QuantCom; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9328873","Internet of Things;big data;underwater network architecture;data acquisition;marine and underwater databases/datasets;underwater wireless sensor network;image and video processing;machine learning;deep neural networks","Big Data;Sensors;Tutorials;Machine learning;Tools;Internet of Things;Distributed databases","data analysis;disasters;geophysics computing;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);underwater acoustic communication;wireless sensor networks","Underwater Things;Big Marine Data analytics;emerging communication ecosystem;underwater objects;underwater environments;IoUT technology;automatic marine transportations;underwater exploration;underwater communications;conventional data;underwater data collection;IoUT data communication techniques;ML solutions;BMD processing","","2","","319","IEEE","20 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a new privacy-preserving anomaly detection framework, so-called PPAD-CPS, is proposed for protecting confidential information and discovering malicious observations in power systems and their network traffic. The framework involves two main modules. First, a data pre-processing module is suggested for filtering and transforming original data into a new format that achieves the target of privacy preservation. Second, an anomaly detection module is suggested using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Kalman Filter (KF) for precisely estimating the posterior probabilities of legitimate and anomalous events. The performance of the PPAD-CPS framework is assessed using two public datasets, namely the Power System and UNSW-NB15 dataset.

Existing sniffing attacks are based on the correct detection of BLE connection initiation state, but they become ineffective for BLE long-lived connections. In this paper, we focus on the adversary setting with a low-cost single radio and develop a suite of real-time algorithms to determine the key parameters necessary to follow and sniff a BLE connection in the connected state. We implement our algorithms in the open source platform - Ubertooth One and evaluate its performance in terms of sniffing overhead and accuracy.

Advanced malware can hide their behavior on detection of the presence of a security tool at a tenant virtual machine (TVM). Hence, TVM-layer security solutions are not reliable. In this paper, we propose a Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) based security architecture design for fine granular monitoring of the virtual machines to detect known attacks and their variants. We have developed techniques for monitoring the TVMs at the process level and system call level to detect attacks such as those based on malicious hidden processes, attacks that disable security tools in the virtual machines and attacks that alter the behavior of legitimate applications to access sensitive data. Our architecture, VMGuard, utilizes the introspection feature at the VMM-layer to analyze system call traces of programs running on TVM. VMGuard applies the software breakpoint injection technique which is OS agnostic and can be used to trap the execution of programs. Motivated by text mining approaches, VMGuard provides `Bag of n-grams (BonG)' approach integrated with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method, to extract and select features of normal and attack traces. It then applies the Random Forest classifier to produce a generic behavior for different categories of intrusions of the monitored TVM.

We here propose to break this equivalence by erasing selected attributes from the original data and reformulate it as a restoration task, where the normal and the anomalous data are expected to be distinguishable based on restoration errors. Through forcing the network to restore the original image, the semantic feature embeddings related to the erased attributes are learned by the network. During testing phases, because anomalous data are restored with the attribute learned from the normal data, the restoration error is expected to be large. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperforms several state-of-thearts on multiple benchmark datasets, especially on ImageNet, increasing the AUROC of the top-performing baseline by 10.1%.

Security in VANET is more crucial, because of different network layers and trusting on unknown intermediate vehicles. There is critical demand of efficient trust management for VANETs, because it prevents fabricated information directed by suspicious nodes connected to the network. A number of factors including lack of infrastructure, autonomous modules, auto-pilot support and dynamic topology due to mobility can result in hardening the reliable trust management solutions.

However, with recent industrial technology advances, the increased connectivity of CPSs and SCADA systems to enterprise networks has uncovered them to new cybersecurity threats and made them a primary target for cyber-attacks with the potential of causing catastrophic economic, social, and environmental damage. Recent research focuses on new methodologies for risk modeling and assessment using game theory and reinforcement learning. This paperwork proposes to frame CPS security on two different levels, strategic and battlefield, by meeting ideas from game theory and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). The strategic level is modeled as imperfect information, extensive form game. Here, the human administrator and the malware author decide on the strategies of defense and attack, respectively. At the battlefield level, strategies are implemented by machine learning agents that derive optimal policies for run-time decisions. The outcomes of these policies manifest as the utility at a higher level, where we aim to reach a Nash Equilibrium (NE) in favor of the defender. We simulate the scenario of a virus spreading in the context of a CPS network.

Specifically, we assume that the attacker knows the architecture of the detector, the training data, and the class of features V the detector can rely on. In order to get an advantage in his race of arms with the attacker, the analyst designs the detector by relying on a subset of features chosen at random in V. Given its ignorance about the exact feature set, the adversary attacks a version of the detector based on the entire feature set. In this way, the effectiveness of the attack diminishes since there is no guarantee that attacking a detector working in the full feature space will result in a successful attack against the reduced-feature detector. We theoretically prove that, thanks to random feature selection, the security of the detector significantly increases at the expense of a negligible loss of performance in the absence of attacks. We also provide an experimental validation of the proposed procedure by focusing on the detection of two specific kinds of image manipulations, namely adaptive histogram equalization and median filtering.

WAMPAC relies heavily on the security of measurements and control commands transmitted over wide-area communication networks for real-time operational, protection, and control functions. The current “N-1” security criterion for grid operation is inadequate to address malicious cyber events; therefore, it is important to fundamentally redesign WAMPAC and to enhance energy management system applications to make them attack resilient. In this paper, we present three key contributions to enhance the cybersecurity and resiliency of WAMPAC. First, we describe an end-to-end attack-resilient cyber-physical security framework for WAMPAC applications encompassing the entire security life cycle including risk assessment, attack prevention, attack detection, attack mitigation, and attack resilience. Second, we describe a defense-in-depth architecture that incorporates attack resilience at both the infrastructure layer and the application layer by leveraging domain-specific security approaches at the WAMPAC application layer in addition to traditional cybersecurity measures at the information technology infrastructure layer.

Since biometric approaches can provide many advantages over the traditional authentication methods, they have become a significant topic for both academia and industry. The major goal of biometric user authentication is to authenticate legitimate users and identify impostors based on physiological and behavioral characteristics. In this paper, we survey the development of existing biometric authentication techniques on mobile phones, particularly on touch-enabled devices, with reference to 11 biometric approaches (five physiological and six behavioral). We present a taxonomy of existing efforts regarding biometric authentication on mobile phones and analyze their feasibility of deployment on touch-enabled mobile phones. In addition, we systematically characterize a generic biometric authentication system with eight potential attack points and survey practical attacks and potential countermeasures on mobile phones. Moreover, we propose a framework for establishing a reliable authentication mechanism through implementing a multimodal biometric user authentication in an appropriate way. Experimental results are presented to validate this framework using touch dynamics, and the results show that multimodal biometrics can be deployed on touch-enabled phones to significantly reduce the false rates of a single biometric system. Finally, we identify challenges and open problems in this area and suggest that touch dynamics will become a mainstream aspect in designing future user authentication on mobile phones.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2386915","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000543","User Authentication;Mobile Phones;Multimodal Biometrics;Touch Dynamics;Behavioral Biometrics;Physiological Biometrics;User authentication;mobile phones;multimodal biometrics;touch dynamics;behavioral biometrics;physiological biometrics","Authentication;Mobile handsets;Iris recognition;Physiology;Face;Retina;Face recognition","biometrics (access control);mobile computing","multimodal biometric user authentication techniques;touch-enabled mobile phones;potential attack points;survey practical attacks","","133","1","243","IEEE","31 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The distributed attack sources, the network size, and the diverse botnet attack techniques challenge the effectiveness of a single-point centralized security solution. This paper proposes a distributed security system against large-scale disruptive botnet attacks by using SDN/NFV and machine-learning. In our system, a set of distributed network functions detect network attacks for each protocol and to collect real-time traffic information, which also gets relayed to the SDN controller for more sophisticated analyses. The SDN controller then analyzes the real-time traffic with the only forwarded information using machine learning and updates the flow rule or take routing/bandwidth-control measures, which get executed on the nodes implementing the security network functions. Our evaluations show the proposed system to be an efficient and effective defense method against botnet attacks. The evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed system detects large-scale distributed network attacks from botnets at the SDN controller while the network functions locally detect known attacks across different networking protocols.","","978-1-5386-8281-4","10.1109/NFV-SDN.2018.8725657","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8725657","Software-defined networking;network Function Virtualization;Botnets;machine-learning","Botnet;Feature extraction;Real-time systems;Protocols;Intrusion detection;Machine learning","computer network security;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);protocols;software defined networking;telecommunication control;telecommunication traffic","distributed security system;large-scale disruptive botnet attacks;real-time traffic information;SDN controller;machine learning;large-scale distributed network attacks;distributed security network functions;software-defined networks;distributed attack sources;diverse botnet attack techniques;single-point centralized security solution;NFV;networking protocols;routing-bandwidth-control","","1","","55","","30 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We analyze the performance of buffer management policies under various characteristics via competitive analysis that provides uniform guarantees across traffic patterns (Borodin and El-Yaniv, 1998). We propose the Longest-Work-Drop policy and show that it is at most 2-competitive and at least sqrt 2}-competitive. Second, we consider another generalization, posed as an open problem in [10], where each unit-sized packet is labeled with an output port and intrinsic value, and the goal is to maximize the total value of transmitted packets. We show first results in this direction and define a scheduling policy that, as we conjecture, may achieve constant competitive ratio.

In the face of an increasing attack landscape, it is necessary to cater for the provision of efficient mechanisms to collectively detect sophisticated malware resulting in undesirable (run-time) device and network modifications. This is not an easy task considering the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of IoT environments; i.e., different operating systems, varied connected networks and a wide gamut of underlying protocols and devices. Malicious IoT nodes or gateways can potentially lead to the compromise of the whole IoT network infrastructure. On the other hand, the SDN control plane has the capability to be orchestrated towards providing enhanced security services to all layers of the IoT networking stack. In this paper, we propose an SDN-enabled control plane based orchestration that leverages emerging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classification models; a Deep Learning (DL) based architecture to combat malicious IoT nodes. It is a first step towards a new line of security mechanisms that enables the provision of scalable AI-based intrusion detection focusing on the operational assurance of only those specific, critical infrastructure components,thus, allowing for a much more efficient security solution. The proposed mechanism has been evaluated with current state of the art datasets (i.e., N_BaIoT 2018) using standard performance evaluation metrics. Our preliminary results show an outstanding detection accuracy (i.e., 99.9%) which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

The hackers then steal this personal information for their own purposes, or sell the information to any other criminal parties. There are various techniques to detect phishing websites. However, Classification Data Mining (DM) Techniques can be a very useful tool in detecting and identifying e-banking phishing websites. This paper proposes two algorithms to overcome the difficulty and complexity in detecting and predicting e-banking phishing website . First approach known as Multiclass Classification based on Association Rule (MCAR) based on using association and classification Data Mining algorithms. The algorithms used to characterize and identify all the factors and rules in order to classify the phishing website and the relationship that correlate them with each other. Another approach called Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost) is also a powerful classifier in which final classification is based on vote of weak classifiers. This paper proposes the modification to original MCAR algorithms with redundant rule pruning technique to reduce number of rules generated in final classifier and minimizes redundancy, hence improves the accuracy. In this paper Adaboost classifier is first time applied to detect phishing website. Results are compared with respect to time, accuracy of MCAR and Adaboost. We also analysed MCAR for generated rule to discarded rule with support and confidence values as a result of pruning techniques applied. The experimental result demonstrates the feasibility of using Associative Classification techniques in real applications and its better performance improvement as compared to Adaboost and other classifications algorithms.","","978-1-84919-859-2","10.1049/cp.2013.2573","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950857","Phishing;Association;Classification;Pruning;MCAR;Adaptive Boosting","","bank data processing;computer crime;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);minimisation;pattern classification;redundancy;unsolicited e-mail;Web sites","association rule mining;phishing dataset classification;e-mail fraud method;legitimate looking email;hackers;data mining;e-banking phishing Website detection;multiclass classification based on association rule;adaptive boosting;MCAR algorithms;rule pruning technique;redundancy minimization;Adaboost classifier;associative classification technique","","","","","","10 Nov 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Based on the generated fingerprints, we propose a novel traffic classification framework. The proposed system generates profiles of normal applications using a multi-modal probability distribution. The proposed classification framework is then extended to detect distributed denial of service attacks from the collected statistical information at flow level. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system, we evaluate its performance using five real-world traffic datasets.

On the other hand, intelligent data processing techniques for enhancing the performance of next-generation networks are mainly used to reinforce resource management, control and optimization. Therefore, compared to learning a classifier for other application scenarios (e.g., pattern recognition, network intrusion detection, image identification, etc.), learning a good regressor via machine learning is more valuable for edge computing applications in next-generation networks. Hence, we revisit the security of polynomial regression learning in this paper and propose a scalable poisoning method against regression-type edge computing applications via an approximate optimization strategy. Specifically, we first analyze the existing gradient-based optimization poisoning method (called OptP) against linear regression model. Then, we extend the method and give a formal description of poisoning against polynomial regression with order greater than one. After that, we propose a greedy optimization strategy to obtain good adversarial examples for compromising polynomial regression-type applications. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed poisoning method by applying it to attack against two synthetic data sets and three public data sets from three different application scenarios.","","978-1-7281-1878-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9093771","","Optimization;Edge computing;Linear regression;Next generation networking;Training data;Machine learning;Data models","computer network management;computer network security;distributed processing;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;maintenance engineering;next generation networks;polynomials;regression analysis","approximate optimization strategy;next-generation networks;network maintenance;intelligent data processing techniques;resource management;network intrusion detection;machine learning;scalable poisoning method;regression-type edge computing applications;linear regression model;greedy optimization strategy;gradient-based optimization poisoning method;polynomial regression-type applications","","","","","","26 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Botshot is cost-effective as compared to the network emulation for botnet traffic data generation rendering the dedicated hardware resources unnecessary. First, we use the extended set of network flow and time-based features for three publicly available botnet datasets. Second, we utilize two GANs (vanilla, conditional) for generating realistic botnet traffic. We evaluate the generator performance using classifier two-sample test (C2ST) with 10-fold 70-30 train-test split and propose the use of 'recall' in contrast to 'accuracy' for proactively learning adversarial evasions. We then augment the train set with the generated data and test using the unchanged test set. Last, we compare our results with benchmark oversampling methods with augmentation of additional botnet traffic data in terms of average accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score over six different ML classifiers.

Despite its huge potential in spurring economic growth by supporting various applications, the increase of consumer UAVs poses potential risks to public security and personal privacy. To minimize the risks, efficiently detecting and identifying invading UAVs is in urgent need for both invasion detection and forensics purposes. Aiming to complement the existing physical detection mechanisms, we propose a machine learning-based framework for fast UAV identification over encrypted Wi-Fi traffic. It is motivated by the observation that many consumer UAVs use Wi-Fi links for control and video streaming. The proposed framework extracts features derived only from packet size and inter-arrival time of encrypted Wi-Fi traffic, and can efficiently detect UAVs and identify their operation modes. In order to reduce the online identification time, our framework adopts a re-weighted ℓ<sub>1</sub>-norm regularization, which considers the number of samples and computation cost of different features. This framework jointly optimizes feature selection and prediction performance in a unified objective function. To tackle the packet inter-arrival time uncertainty when optimizing the trade-off between the detection accuracy and delay, we utilize maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method to estimate the packet inter-arrival time. We collect a large number of real-world Wi-Fi data traffic of eight types of consumer UAVs and conduct extensive evaluation on the performance of our proposed method. Evaluation results show that our proposed method can detect and identify tested UAVs within 0.15-0.35s with high accuracy of 85.7-95.2%. The UAV detection range is within the physical sensing range of 70m and 40m in the line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios, respectively.

Unfortunately, basic security measures like properly encrypted communications does not protect against these threats. The massive scale of the IoT device population and enormous diversity of device hardware, operating systems, software frameworks and manufacturers makes it very difficult to establish standard IoT security and privacy-protecting solutions by simply applying known solutions, neither for per-device security architectures nor for network security measures. In particular, existing intrusion detection techniques to detect compromised IoT devices seem ineffective. In this talk, we will present our recent work on addressing various security and privacy challenges in the growing IoT landscape including industry collaborations.

Depending on the number of ngrams found or not found in the packet it is labeled either as normal or anomalous. Previous methods use either presence or absence of ngram in training dataset or use frequency of its occurrence in the entire training dataset. This approach results into many false positives and false negatives. In this paper we propose a novel payload analysis technique for the detection of Zero day attacks against web traffic.

The IIoT is characterized by an increased degree of inter-connectivity, which not only creates opportunities for the industries that adopt it, but also for cyber-criminals. Indeed, IoT security currently represents one of the major obstacles that prevent the widespread adoption of IIoT technology. Unsurprisingly, such concerns led to an exponential growth of published research over the last few years. To get an overview of the field, we deem it important to systematically survey the academic literature so far, and distill from it various security requirements as well as their popularity.

The physical proximity of these edge devices will allow for intelligent reasoning one hop away from data generation. This will allow a range of modern urban reasoning applications that require reduced latency and jitter such as remote surgery, vehicle collision detection and augmented reality. The traffic flow from IoT devices to the cloud will also be reduced as with the increased accuracy from deep learning models only a subset of the data will need to be reported after a first pass analysis. However, the training time of deep learning models can be long, taking weeks on multiple desktop GPUs for large datasets. In this paper we show how transfer learning can be used to update the last layers of pre-trained models at the edge of the network, dramatically reducing the training time and allowing the model to perform new tasks without data ever having to be sent to the cloud. This will also improve the users' privacy, which is a key requirement for urban intelligence applications with the introduction of GDPR. We compare our approach to alternative IoT urban intelligence architectures such as cloud-based architectures and deep learning algorithms trained only on local data.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2963912","Science Foundation Ireland(grant numbers:13/IA/1885); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8949510","Edge computing;transfer learning;deep learning;urban intelligence;IoT;QoS","Cloud computing;Deep learning;Image edge detection;Augmented reality;Delays;Data models;Computer architecture","cloud computing;data privacy;embedded systems;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","deep edges;embedded devices;edge devices;intelligent reasoning one hop;data generation;vehicle collision detection;IoT devices;transfer learning;deep learning;IoT urban intelligence architectures;users privacy","","1","","96","CCBY","3 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As such, they have become further exposed to cyber-attacks. Recent catastrophic events have demonstrated that standard, human-based management of anomaly detection in complex systems is not efficient enough and have underlined the significance of automated detection, intelligent and rapid response. Nevertheless, existing anomaly detection frameworks usually are not capable of dealing with the dynamic and complicated nature of the CPSs. In this study, we introduce an unsupervised framework for anomaly detection based on an Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Autoencoder. In particular, we first construct statistical correlation matrices to characterize the system status across different time steps. Next, a 2D convolutional encoder is employed to encode the patterns of the correlation matrices, whereas an Attention-based Convolutional LSTM Encoder-Decoder (ConvLSTM-ED) is used to capture the temporal dependencies. More precisely, we introduce an input attention mechanism to adaptively select the most significant input features at each time step. Finally, the 2D convolutional decoder reconstructs the correlation matrices. The differences between the reconstructed correlation matrices and the original ones are used as indicators of anomalies. Extensive experimental analysis on data collected from all six stages of Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) testbed, a scaled-down version of a real-world industrial water treatment plant, demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline techniques.","","978-1-7281-4550-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2019.00212","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8999210","Anomaly Detection;Multivariate Time Series;CPS;Attention Mechanism","Time series analysis;Correlation;Anomaly detection;Logic gates;Two dimensional displays;Neural networks;Decoding","convolutional neural nets;cyber-physical systems;environmental science computing;feature extraction;matrix algebra;recurrent neural nets;security of data;spatiotemporal phenomena;statistical analysis;unsupervised learning;water treatment","SWaT testbed;ConvLSTM-ED;secure water treatment testbed;attention-based convolutional LSTM Encoder-decoder;2D convolutional decoder reconstruction;attention-based spatio-temporal autoencoder;catastrophic events;cyber-attacks;actuators;networked sensors;cyber-physical systems;industrial water treatment plant;2D convolutional encoder;statistical correlation matrices;unsupervised framework;CPSs;anomaly detection frameworks;human-based management","","1","","34","","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unsupervised intrusion detection can straightforwardly be addressed through supervised user identification. This allows us to simply model the normal behavior of users implicitly within any supervised classifier. However certain users can have very similar behavior as shown by their audit sessions, thus learning to distinguish them is meaningless and leads to false positives. To address this issue we propose a second method, which identifies user clusters instead of individual users. By discarding harmless alarms for users with similar sessions, a better trade-off between false positives and detection rate can be achieved. We evaluate both methods on real-world and synthetic corporate audit sessions: our methods outperform anomaly detection baselines for masquerade detection. Our results suggest that user identification is effective for masquerades, while insider threats should be detected differently.","","978-1-7281-2711-8","10.1109/ICCC.2019.00016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8816990","security;intrusion detection;user identification;clustering;masquerade;insider threat","Intrusion detection;Computational modeling;Authentication;Anomaly detection;Organizations;Task analysis;Training","auditing;business data processing;pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","unsupervised intrusion detection;insider threats;supervised user identification;supervised classifier;masquerade detection;corporate audit sessions;user clustering","","","","45","","29 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we show how deep learning can be used to build state-of-the intrusion detection algorithms that can be executed on small routers near the IoT edge. Adversarial autoencoders with the K nearest neighbor algorithm were trained on the NSL-KDD intrusion data set to yield state-of-the-art results.

However, despite their increasing popularity and adoption, there is a lack of standardized models that study blockchain-related security threats. To fill this gap, the main focus of our work is to systematize and extend the knowledge about the security and privacy aspects of blockchains and contribute to the standardization of this domain.We propose the security reference architecture (SRA) for blockchains, which adopts a stacked model (similar to the ISO/OSI) describing the nature and hierarchy of various security and privacy aspects. The SRA contains four layers: (1) the network layer, (2) the consensus layer, (3) the replicated state machine layer, and (4) the application layer. At each of these layers, we identify known security threats, their origin, and countermeasures, while we also analyze several cross-layer dependencies. Next, to enable better reasoning about security aspects of blockchains by the practitioners, we propose a blockchain-specific version of the threat-risk assessment standard ISO/IEC 15408 by embedding the stacked model into this standard. Finally, we provide designers of blockchain platforms and applications with a design methodology following the model of SRA and its hierarchy.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2020.3033665","NRF, Prime Minister’s Office, Singapore, through its National Cybersecurity Research and Development Programme(grant numbers:NRF2016NCRNCR002-028); National Cybersecurity Research and Development Directorate; Czech Science Foundation(grant numbers:20-07487S); H2020 ECSEL Project VALU3S(grant numbers:876852); Internal Project of Brno University of Technology(grant numbers:FIT-S-20-6427); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9239372","Reference architecture;blockchains;distributed ledgers;security;privacy;vulnerabilities;threats;ISO/IEC 15408","Security;Standards;Privacy;Consensus protocol","blockchains;data privacy;IEC standards;ISO standards;open systems;risk management","security reference architecture;standardized model;privacy aspects;SRA;stacked model;network layer;consensus layer;replicated state machine layer;application layer;cross-layer dependencies;blockchain platforms;ISO/IEC 15408","","4","","342","CCBY","26 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In MANETs, it is of great importance to detect anomaly and malicious behavior. In order to detect malicious attacks via intrusion detection systems and analyze the data set, we need to select some features. Hence, feature selection plays critical role in detecting various attacks. In the literature, there are several proposals to select such features. Usually, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) analyzes the data set and the selected features. In this paper, we have collected a feature set from some state-of-the-art works in the literature. Actually, our simulation shows this feature set detect anomaly behavior more accurate. In addition, for the first time, we use robust PCA for analyzing the data set instead of PCA in MANET. By means of robust PCA, we have an unsupervised algorithm versus semi-supervised provided by PCA. In contrast to PCA, our results show robust PCA cannot be affected by outlier data within the network.

This class of threats, well known as advanced persistent threats (APTs), are those that every nation and well-established organization fears and wants to protect itself against. While nation-sponsored APT attacks will always be marked by their sophistication, APT attacks that have become prominent in corporate sectors do not make it any less challenging for the organizations. The rate at which the attack tools and techniques are evolving is making any existing security measures inadequate. As defenders strive to secure every endpoint and every link within their networks, attackers are finding new ways to penetrate into their target systems. With each day bringing new forms of malware, having new signatures and behavior that is close to normal, a single threat detection system would not suffice. While it requires time and patience to perform APT, solutions that adapt to the changing behavior of APT attacker(s) are required. Several works have been published on detecting an APT attack at one or two of its stages, but very limited research exists in detecting APT as a whole from reconnaissance to cleanup, as such a solution demands complex correlation and fine-grained behavior analysis of users and systems within and across networks. Through this survey paper, we intend to bring all those methods and techniques that could be used to detect different stages of APT attacks, learning methods that need to be applied and where to make your threat detection framework smart and undecipherable for those adapting APT attackers. We also present different case studies of APT attacks, different monitoring methods, and mitigation methods to be employed for fine-grained control of security of a networked system.

In this article, we design a novel adversarial attack against DL-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) in the Internet-of-Things environment, with only black-box accesses to the DL model in such NIDS. We introduce two techniques: 1) model extraction is adopted to replicate the black-box model with a small amount of training data and 2) a saliency map is then used to disclose the impact of each packet attribute on the detection results, and the most critical features. This enables us to efficiently generate AEs using conventional methods. With these tehniques, we successfully compromise one state-of-the-art NIDS, Kitsune: the adversary only needs to modify less than 0.005% of bytes in the malicious packets to achieve an average 94.31% attack success rate.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3048038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9311132","Adversarial examples (AEs);deep learning (DL);Internet of Things (IoT);network intrusion detection","Feature extraction;Computational modeling;Internet of Things;Training;Perturbation methods;Mathematical model;Detectors","data protection;deep learning (artificial intelligence);Internet of Things;security of data","adversarial attacks;IoT systems;deep learning;normal network activities;malicious network activities;network intrusion detection systems;DL model;black-box model;Internet-of-Things environment;model extraction;saliency map;packet attribute;security protection","","5","","30","IEEE","30 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such efforts require providing accurate, meaningful, and trustworthy output from the streaming sensors particularly during dynamic virtual sensing. However, to ensure that the sensing ecosystem is devoid of any sensor threats or active attacks, it is paramount to implement secure real-time strategies. Fundamentally, real-time detection of adversarial attacks/instances during the User Feedback Process (UFP) is the key to forecasting potential attacks in active learning. Also, according to existing literature, there lacks a comprehensive study that has a focus on adversarial detection from an active machine learning perspective at the time of writing this paper. Therefore, the authors posit the importance of detecting adversarial attacks in active learning strategy. Attack in the context of this paper through a UFP-Threat driven model has been presented as any action that exerts an alteration to the learning system or data. To achieve this, the study employed ambient data collected from a smart environment human activity recognition from (Continuous Ambient Sensors Dataset, CASA) with fully labeled connections, where we intentionally subject the Dataset to wrong labels as a targeted/manipulative attack (by a malevolent labeler) in the UFP, with an assumption that the user-labels were connected to unique identities. While the dataset's focus is to classify tasks and predict activities, our study gives a focus on active adversarial strategies from an information security point of view. Furthermore, the strategies for modeling threats have been presented using the Meta Attack Language (MAL) compiler for purposes adversarial detection. The findings from the experiments conducted have shown that real-time adversarial identification and profiling during the UFP could significantly increase the accuracy during the learning process with a high degree of certainty and paves the way towards an automated adversarial detection and profiling approaches on the Internet of Cognitive Things (ICoT).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3063002","The Swedish Knowledge Foundation through the Internet of Things and People (IOTAP), Malmö University, Malmö, Sweden(grant numbers:20140035); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9366529","Adversarial detection;user-feedback-process;active machine learning;monitoring industrial feedback","Machine learning;Activity recognition;Real-time systems;Actuators;Training;Pipelines;Intelligent sensors","cognition;feedback;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;program compilers;program diagnostics;security of data;trusted computing","user feedback process;information and communication technology;data streaming;streaming sensors;dynamic virtual sensing;sensor threats;learning system;smart environment human activity recognition;meta attack language compiler;real-time adversarial identification;learning process;automated adversarial detection;active machine learning adversarial attack detection;UFP threat driven model;continuous ambient sensors dataset;automated adversarial profiling;CASA;Internet of Cognitive Things;ICoT;MAL compiler","","","","35","CCBY","1 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"On the Difficulty of Membership Inference Attacks","S. Rezaei; X.

Despite their apparent success, these studies only report accuracy, precision, and recall of the positive class (member class). Hence, the performance of these attacks have not been clearly reported on negative class (non-member class). In this paper, we show that the way the MI attack performance has been reported is often misleading because they suffer from high false positive rate or false alarm rate (FAR) that has not been reported. FAR shows how often the attack model mislabel non-training samples (non-member) as training (member) ones. The high FAR makes MI attacks fundamentally impractical, which is particularly more significant for tasks such as membership inference where the majority of samples in reality belong to the negative (non-training) class. Moreover, we show that the current MI attack models can only identify the membership of misclassified samples with mediocre accuracy at best, which only constitute a very small portion of training samples.We analyze several new features that have not been comprehensively explored for membership inference before, including distance to the decision boundary and gradient norms, and conclude that deep models’ responses are mostly similar among train and non-train samples. We conduct several experiments on image classification tasks, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, using various model architecture, including LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet, etc. We show that the current state-of-the-art MI attacks cannot achieve high accuracy and low FAR at the same time, even when the attacker is given several advantages.

"A Packet-Length-Adjustable Attention Model Based on Bytes Embedding Using Flow-WGAN for Smart Cybersecurity","L. Han; Y. Sheng; X.

Almost all of the intrusion detection methods based on deep learning have poor data processing capacity with the increase in the data length. Most intrusion detection methods can only handle the header part of the traffic and omit valuable information from the payload, so they cannot detect the malicious traffic when the hacker hides the attack behavior in the payload. In this paper, we propose an attention model that can process network traffic flow with adjustable length to detect the payload-based attacks. Furthermore, we design a Flow Wasserstein GAN model to generate new network traffic data from the original data sets to enhance the network packet data and protect the user's privacy. Our model has a hierarchical structure to build the representations of bytes and packets on two levels. Moreover, two levels of attention mechanisms enable the model to pay attention to more important content when constructing the flow representation. The experiments based on the ISCX-2012 and ISCX-2017 datasets prove that the proposed model has higher performance in accuracy and true positive rate (TPR) than four state-of-the-art deep learning methods. The experiment shows that our model outperforms the existing HSAT-IDS in the detection of the generated packets.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2924492","Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDC02010701); National Science and Technology Major Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology, China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8744218","Malicious traffic detection;deep learning;cybersecurity","Feature extraction;Logic gates;Deep learning;Intrusion detection;Computer security;Task analysis;Malware","computer crime;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","network traffic data;network packet data;flow representation;packet-length-adjustable attention model;Flow-WGAN;smart cybersecurity;malicious traffic detection;intrusion detection methods;payload-based attacks;Flow Wasserstein GAN model;deep learning methods","","6","","75","CCBY","24 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Autonomic networking calls for automated decisions for management actions. This can be realized through a set of pre-defined network management policies engineered from human expert knowledge. However, engineering sufficiently accurate knowledge considering the high complexity of today's networking environment is a difficult task. This has been a particularly limiting factor in the practical deployment of autonomic systems. ML is a powerful technique for extracting knowledge from data. However, there has been little evidence of its application in realizing practical management solutions for autonomic networks. Recent advances in network softwarization and programmability through SDN and NFV, the proliferation of new sources of data, and the availability of lowcost and seemingly infinite storage and compute resource from the cloud are paving the way for the adoption of ML to realize cognitive network management in support of autonomic networking. This article is intended to stimulate thought and foster discussion on how to defeat the bottlenecks that are limiting the wide deployment of autonomic systems, and the role that ML can play in this regard.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8255757","","Artificial neural networks;Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Autonomic systems;Data models;Training data;Complexity theory;Machine learning","computer network management;learning (artificial intelligence);software defined networking","autonomic self-managing networks;autonomic networking calls;management actions;network management policies;human expert knowledge;networking environment;autonomic systems;ML;practical management solutions;autonomic networks;network softwarization;cognitive network management","","52","","18","","12 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

These methods can be prone to generalization, especially in a binary attack classification setting, where the objective is to differentiate between benign vs. malicious behavior. This generalization creates risky security blind-spot weaknesses that make the system vulnerable. Current attackers are well aware of these blind-spots and as a counter-strategy, they exploit such vulnerabilities to bypass security measures and achieve their nefarious objectives. In this work, we propose a methodology to mitigate the problem, RIsky Blind-Spot (RIBS), by making the classification more robust. Our proposed approach creates a generator model that can learn the real characteristics of the data, and consequently, sample real examples targeting the blind-spots of a classifier. We validate our methodology in the context of power grids, where we show how this framework can improve the detection of unknown malicious behavior. Our approach provides an increment of 10% in terms of accuracy and detected attacks when compared to the baseline method.","","978-1-7281-0858-2","10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006356","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9006356","","Generators;Security;Encoding;Machine learning;Neural networks;Training;Games","learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;power grids;power system protection;security of data","risky blind-spot;generator model;nefarious objectives;security measures;risky security blind-spot weaknesses;binary attack classification setting;cyber-security applications;attack classification models;RIBS;unknown malicious behavior","","","","17","","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
