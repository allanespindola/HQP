Machine learning (ML) has recently been applied to solve complex problems in many fields, including finance, health care, and business. ML algorithms can offer computational models that can solve complex communication network problems and consequently improve performance. This paper reviews the recent trends in the application of ML models in communication networks for prediction, intrusion detection, route and path assignment, Quality of Service improvement, and resource management.

In particular, promising detection results have been demonstrated in conjunction with Software-Defined Networks (SDN), in which the logically centralized control plane provides access to data from across the network. However, research into adversarial attacks against machine learning classifiers has highlighted vulnerabilities in a number of fields. These vulnerabilities raise concerns about the implementation of similar classifiers in anomaly-based NIDSs within SDNs. In this work, we investigate the viability of adversarial attacks against classifiers in this field. We implement an anomaly-based NIDS, Neptune, as a target platform that utilises a number of different machine learning classifiers and traffic flow features. We develop an adversarial test tool, Hydra, to evaluate the impact of adversarial evasion classifier attacks against Neptune with the goal of lowering the detection rate of malicious network traffic. The results demonstrate that with the perturbation of a few features, the detection accuracy of a specific SYN flood Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack by Neptune decreases from 100% to 0% across a number of classifiers. Based on these results, recommendations are made as to how to increase the robustness of classifiers against the demonstrated attacks.","","978-1-7281-4545-7","10.1109/NFV-SDN47374.2019.9040101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9040101","Network Security;Software-Defined Networks;Intrusion Detection Systems;Machine Learning;Adversarial Attacks.","Feature extraction;Machine learning;Computer crime;Network function virtualization;Support vector machines;Conferences","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic","SYN flood distributed denial of service attack;Hydra;machine learning classifiers;ML-NIDS;machine-learning based network intrusion detection systems;detection accuracy;malicious network traffic;detection rate;adversarial evasion classifier attacks;adversarial test tool;SDNs;anomaly-based NIDS;adversarial attacks;logically centralized control plane;Software-Defined Networks;network attacks","","6","","27","","19 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For instance, the distribution of the training process to a myriad of devices limits the classification performance of machine learning (ML) algorithms, often showing a significantly degraded accuracy compared to centralized learning. In this paper, we investigate the problem of performance limitation under FL and present the benefit of data augmentation with an application of anomaly detection using an IoT dataset. Our initial study reveals that one of the critical reasons for the performance degradation is that each device sees only a small fraction of data (that it generates), which limits the efficacy of the local ML model (constructed by the device). This becomes more critical if the data holds the class imbalance problem, observed not infrequently in practice (e.g., a small fraction of anomalies). Moreover, device heterogeneity with respect to data quantity is an open challenge in FL. Based on these observations, we examine the impact of data augmentation on detection performance in FL settings (both homogeneous and heterogeneous). Our experimental results show that even a simple random oversampling can improve detection performance with manageable learning complexity.","","978-1-7281-9916-0","10.1109/MSN50589.2020.00045","Advanced Scientific Computing Research; Office of Science; U.S. Department of Energy; National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9394275","Federated Learning;Internet of Things;Anomaly Detection;Machine Learning","Performance evaluation;Training;Privacy;Collaborative work;Sensors;Internet of Things;Anomaly detection","data privacy;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;sampling methods","manageable learning complexity;FL settings;data quantity;device heterogeneity;class imbalance problem;local ML model;performance degradation;critical reasons;IoT dataset;data augmentation;performance limitation;centralized learning;degraded accuracy;machine learning algorithms;classification performance;training process;technical challenges;privacy protection capabilities;scalable cooperative learning;Things computing;mobile Internet;federated learning;IoT anomaly detection performance","","","","24","","7 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional intrusion detection methods face difficulty in processing high-speed network data and cannot detect currently unknown attacks. Therefore, this paper proposes a network attack detection method combining a flow calculation and deep learning. The method consists of two parts: a real-time detection algorithm based on flow calculations and frequent patterns and a classification algorithm based on the deep belief network and support vector machine (DBN-SVM). Sliding window (SW) stream data processing enables real-time detection, and the DBN-SVM algorithm can improve classification accuracy. Finally, to verify the proposed method, a system is implemented. Based on the CICIDS2017 open source data set, a series of comparative experiments are conducted. The method's real-time detection efficiency is higher than that of traditional machine learning algorithms. The attack classification accuracy is 0.7 percentage points higher than that of a DBN, which is 2 percentage points higher than that of the integrated algorithm boosting and bagging methods. Hence, it is suitable for the real-time detection of high-speed network intrusions.","2329-9274","","10.1109/JAS.2020.1003099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9049446","","Real-time systems;Intrusion detection;Classification algorithms;Support vector machines;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;High-speed networks","belief networks;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;real-time systems;security of data;support vector machines;ubiquitous computing","deep learning;real-time detection;deep belief network;support vector machine;DBN-SVM algorithm;CICIDS2017 open source data;attack classification;ubiquitous network attack detection;network intrusion detection;sliding window stream data processing;cyberattacks","","4","","","","27 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Typically, it is costly and time consuming to build a classifier, because this requires collecting training data (e.g., through crowdsourcing), selecting a suitable machine learning algorithm (through extensive tests and using domain-specific knowledge), and optimizing the underlying hyperparameters (applying a good understanding of the classifier's structure). In addition, all this information is typically proprietary and should be protected. With the proposed black-box attack approach, an adversary can use deep learning to reliably infer the necessary information by using labels previously obtained from the classifier under attack, and build a functionally equivalent machine learning classifier without knowing the type, structure or underlying parameters of the original classifier. Results for a text classification application demonstrate that deep learning can infer Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers with high accuracy and steal their functionalities. This new attack paradigm with deep learning introduces additional security challenges for online machine learning algorithms and raises the need for novel mitigation strategies to counteract the high fidelity inference capability of deep learning.","","978-1-5090-6356-7","10.1109/THS.2017.7943475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7943475","Machine learning;adversarial machine learning;classifier;deep learning;exploratory attacks","Machine learning;Support vector machines;Training data;Neurons;Machine learning algorithms;Organizations;Security","inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;text analysis","machine learning classifier;deep learning;exploratory machine learning attack;functionally equivalent machine;training data;crowdsourcing;domain-specific knowledge;hyperparameter optimization;classifier structure;black-box attack approach;text classification application;Naive Bayes classifier;SVM classifier inference;security challenges;online machine learning algorithms;mitigation strategies;high fidelity inference capability","","27","2","19","","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike physical weapons such as firearms, naval vessels, and piloted aircraft-all of which risk physical exposure when engaged in direct combat-cyberweapons can be deployed (often without their victims' awareness) under the protection of the anonymity inherent in cyberspace. Furthermore, it is difficult in the cyber domain to determine with accuracy what a malicious actor may target and what type of cyberweapon the actor may wield. These aspects imply an advantage for malicious actors in cyberspace that is greater than for those in any other domain, as the malicious cyberactor, under current international constructs and norms, has the ability to choose the time, place, and weapon of engagement. This being said, if defenders are to successfully repel attempted intrusions, then they must conduct an active cyberdefense within a framework that proactively engages threatening actions independent of a requirement to achieve attribution. This paper proposes that private business, government personnel, and cyberdefenders must develop a threat identification framework that does not depend upon attribution of the malicious actor, i.e., an attribution agnostic cyberdefense construct. Furthermore, upon developing this framework, network defenders must deploy internally based cyberthreat countermeasures that take advantage of defensive network environmental variables and alter the calculus of nefarious individuals in cyberspace. Only by accomplishing these two objectives can the defenders of cyberspace actively combat malicious agents within the virtual realm.","2325-5374","978-9949-9544-1-4","10.1109/CYCON.2014.6916398","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6916398","active defense;attribution agnostic cyberdefense construct;internally based cyberthreat countermeasures","Cyberspace;Government;Law;Internet;Computer security;Educational institutions","security of data","attribution agnostic cyberdefense constructs;internally based cyberthreat countermeasures;active cyberdefense;proactive framework;physical weapons;cyberweapons;anonymity protection;cyber domain;malicious actor;international constructs;international norms;private business;government personnel;cyberdefenders;threat identification framework","","1","","31","","7 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these ground-truth datasets are frequently affected by significant class imbalance as generally they contain much more information regarding legal services (Exchange, Gambling), than regarding services that may be related to illicit activities (Mixer, Service). Class imbalance increases the complexity of applying machine learning techniques and reduces the quality of classification results, especially for underrepresented, but critical classes.In this paper, we propose to address this problem by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Bitcoin data augmentation as GANs recently have shown promising results in the domain of image classification. However, there is no “one-fits-all” GAN solution that works for every scenario. In fact, setting GAN training parameters is non-trivial and heavily affects the quality of the generated synthetic data. We therefore evaluate how GAN parameters such as the optimization function, the size of the dataset and the chosen batch size affect GAN implementation for one underrepresented entity class (Mining Pool) and demonstrate how a “good” GAN configuration can be obtained that achieves high similarity between synthetically generated and real Bitcoin address data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study presenting GANs as a valid tool for generating synthetic address data for data augmentation in Bitcoin entity classification.","","978-1-7281-7091-6","10.1109/BRAINS49436.2020.9223269","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9223269","Generative Adversarial Network;class imbalance;data augmentation;Bitcoin classifier;address behaviour","","data mining;electronic money;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","generative adversarial networks;Bitcoin data augmentation;Bitcoin entity classification;ground-truth dataset;supervised machine learning approaches;machine learning techniques;image classification;one-fits-all GAN solution;GAN training parameters;GAN parameters;GAN implementation;synthetically generated Bitcoin address data;GAN configuration;mining pool","","","","32","","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, we propose an intrusion detection system (IDS) based on Hidden Markov Models for the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Our system extracts suitable features from CAN packets and uses them to train and construct system model parameters. The system operates by comparing test transition sequences obtained in the detection phase and normal sequences built in the training phase. HMM is a powerful tool to process no linear and time-variant systems. For this reason, the proposed IDS shows a good performance namely substantial decrease of false positive errors and increase of detection rate.","1847-358X","978-953-290-088-0","10.23919/SOFTCOM.2019.8903789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8903789","in-vehicle networks;self-driven cars;HMM;anomaly detection;CAN packets","","Bluetooth;controller area networks;cryptography;feature extraction;hidden Markov models;object detection","efficient Hidden Markov model;anomaly detection;CAN Bus networks;bus network;internal communications;external access;in-vehicle networks;wireless interfaces;Wi-Fi;external threats;high danger;securing this bus;cryptographic approaches;anomaly-detection techniques;real-time detection;intrusion detection system;IDS;hidden Markov models;controller area network bus;system model parameters;test transition sequences;detection phase;normal sequences;time-variant systems;detection rate","","1","","17","","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These changes may or may not be in direct response to a change in the opponent's strategy. In any case, it is important to have a set of quantitative metrics to characterize and understand the effectiveness of attackers' and defenders' evolutionary strategies, which reflect their cyber agility. Despite its clear importance, few systematic metrics have been developed to quantify the cyber agility of attackers and defenders. In this paper, we propose the first metric framework for measuring cyber agility in terms of the effectiveness of the dynamic evolution of cyber attacks and defenses. The proposed framework is generic and applicable to transform any relevant, quantitative, and/or conventional static security metrics (e.g., false positives and false negatives) into dynamic metrics to capture dynamics of system behaviors.

Despite recent advances of deep learning in recognizing image anomalies, these methods still prove incapable of handling complex images, such as those encountered in the medical domain. Barely visible abnormalities in chest X-rays or metastases in lymph nodes on the scans of the pathology slides resemble normal images and are very difficult to detect. To address this problem, we introduce a new powerful method of image anomaly detection. It relies on the classical autoencoder approach with a re-designed training pipeline to handle high-resolution, complex images, and a robust way of computing an image abnormality score. We revisit the very problem statement of fully unsupervised anomaly detection, where no abnormal examples are provided during the model setup. We propose to relax this unrealistic assumption by using a very small number of anomalies of confined variability merely to initiate the search of hyperparameters of the model. We evaluate our solution on two medical datasets containing radiology and digital pathology images, where the state-of-the-art anomaly detection models, originally devised for natural image benchmarks, fail to perform sufficiently well.

Furthermore, different computational intelligence schemes are explored to combine these models to create anomaly detection ensembles for improving the detection performance. Evaluation results show that the approach allows learning from unlabelled data under challenging conditions for insider threat detection. Insider threats are detected with high detection and low false positive rates. For example, 60% of malicious insiders are detected under 0.1% investigation budget, and all malicious insiders are detected at less than 5% investigation budget. Furthermore, we explore the ability of the proposed approach to generalize for detecting new anomalous behaviors in different datasets, i.e., robustness.

Thanks to a distance-based paradigm used at the leaves of the trees, this semi-supervised approach solves a drawback that has been identified in the isolation forest (IF) algorithm. Moreover, taking into account the frequencies of visits in the leaves of the random trees allows to significantly improve the performance of DiFF-RF when considering the presence of collective anomalies. DiFF-RF is fairly easy to train, and good performance can be obtained by using a simple semi-supervised procedure to setup the extra hyper-parameter that is introduced. We first evaluate DiFF-RF on a synthetic data set to i) verify that the limitation of the IF algorithm is overcome, ii) demonstrate how collective anomalies are actually detected and iii) to analyze the effect of the meta-parameters it involves. We assess the DiFF-RF algorithm on a large set of datasets from the UCI repository, as well as four benchmarks related to network intrusion detection applications. Our experiments show that DiFF-RF almost systematically outperforms the IF algorithm and one of its extended variant, but also challenges the one-class SVM baseline, deep learning variational auto-encoder and ensemble of auto-encoder architectures.

One of the main challenges addressed by our approach involves developing a suite of techniques that make the detection signal robust and reliable. At a high-level, the techniques we develop effectively leverage the correlation between suspicious information flows that arise during an attacker campaign. In addition to its detection capability, HOLMES is also able to generate a high-level graph that summarizes the attacker's actions in real-time. This graph can be used by an analyst for an effective cyber response. An evaluation of our approach against some real-world APTs indicates that HOLMES can detect APT campaigns with high precision and low false alarm rate.

The most crucial step of the weighted fusion approach is to assign weights for classifiers. It is known that different classifiers have varied performances on different subsets of data, and therefore a samplewise adaptive weight is more desirable than a fixed one. For each sample, a desired weight should be able to characterize the reliability of a classifier, so that the advantages of different classifiers can be exploited. We propose a neighborhood consistency based adaptive weighting method, which assigns a large weight to a classifier on a sample if the prediction of the sample is consistent to the predictions of its local neighbors.

However, recent studies show that blockchain systems such as Bitcoin can be (mis) used to store arbitrary content. This has already been used to store arguably objectionable content on Bitcoin's blockchain. Already single instances of clearly objectionable or even illegal content can put the whole system at risk by making its node operators culpable. To overcome this imminent risk, we survey and discuss the design space of countermeasures against the insertion of such objectionable content. Our analysis shows a wide spectrum of potential countermeasures, which are often combinable for increased efficiency. First, we investigate special-purpose content detectors as an ad hoc mitigation. As they turn out to be easily evadable, we also investigate content-agnostic countermeasures.

A complete NGFW system has three main components: Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), and an extra-firewall intelligence mechanism. One example of open-source DPI implementations is called nDPI. As the number of enterprise applications (used in the commercial organizations) continues to rise, nDPI is also lagging in terms of coverage for enterprise software support. The aim of this research is to design and implement better enterprise-grade software support protocols on nDPI. Five common enterprise applications were chosen and implemented. The experiment results were then compared with the commercial implementation of NGFW in terms of overall precision and performance of nDPI. The results show that the accuracy of nDPI the new protocols implemented reaches more than 90% with a small (less than 3,5%) increase of CPU execution time and very small (less than 1%) increase of peak heap memory usage.","","978-1-5386-4572-7","10.1109/ICoICT.2018.8528792","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8528792","Next Generation Firewall;Deep Packet Inspection;Protocol Identification;Enterprise Software","IP networks;Protocols;Software;Measurement;Tools;Inspection;Feature extraction","authorisation;cryptographic protocols;firewalls;quality of service;telecommunication traffic","Next Generation Firewall;application-based filtering firewall;full enterprise software support;nDPI;quality of service;commercial implementation;common enterprise applications;enterprise-grade software support protocols;commercial organizations;open-source DPI implementations;extra-firewall intelligence mechanism;Intrusion Prevention System;Deep Packet Inspection;complete NGFW system;known security threats;standard firewall","","","","16","","11 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the extensive interconnection of industrial systems with corporate systems in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks exposes the industrial domain to severe cyber risks. Because of many proprietary multilevel protocols, limited upgrade opportunities, heterogeneous communication infrastructures, and a very large trust boundary, conventional IT security fails to prevent cyberattacks against IIoT networks. Recent secure protocols, such as secure distributed network protocol (DNP 3.0), are limited to weak hash functions for critical response time requirements. As a complementary, we propose an adaptive trust boundary protection for IIoT networks using a deep-learning, feature-extraction-based semisupervised model. Our proposed approach is novel in that it is compatible with multilevel protocols of IIoT. The proposed approach does not require any manual effort to update the attack databases and can learn the rapidly changing natures of unknown attack models using unsupervised learnings and unlabeled data from the wild. Therefore, the proposed approach is resilient to emerging cyberattacks and their dynamic nature. The proposed approach has been verified using a real IIoT testbed. Extensive experimental analysis of the attack models and results shows that the proposed approach significantly improves the identification of attacks over conventional security control techniques.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2020.3015026","King Saud University(grant numbers:RSP-2020/18); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9162532","Cyberattack models;deep learning;IIoT;industrial control system;protocol vulnerabilities;secure DNP3.0;semisupervised model;trust boundary protection","Protocols;Informatics;Internet of Things;Security;Machine learning;Adaptation models;Process control","feature extraction;Internet of Things;protocols;security of data;unsupervised learning","corporate systems;industrial Internet of Things networks;industrial domain;severe cyber risks;DNP 3.0;unlabeled data;deep-learning feature-extraction;industrial systems;joint venture virtual production systems;critical solutions;conventional security control techniques;unsupervised learnings;unknown attack models;semisupervised model;adaptive trust boundary protection;critical response time requirements;secure distributed network protocol;IIoT networks;heterogeneous communication infrastructures;proprietary multilevel protocols","","4","","37","IEEE","7 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To proactively address the security issue of ICSs, this article presents a unified architectural approach from the perspectives of cyberthreats on ICSs, security-related ICS technologies, and methods for ICSs. It incorporates secure networks, secure control systems, secure physical processes, and their interactions seamlessly into a unified framework. To increase the resistance of ICSs against intrusions, the network security in our architectural approach is to secure the data in motion through the integration of secure network architecture, secure industrial network protocols, and secure end-to-end communications. The protection of control systems in our architectural approach is risk-based and hierarchical and encompasses prevention- and tolerance-centric defenses. It provides a layer-by-layer defense so that an acceptable level of cybersecurity risk is achieved and maintained. Aiming to maintain the stable operation of physical ICS processes, the secure control in our architectural approach implements a security process against process-aware attacks through a resilient safety control scheme. The global and systematic architectural approach presented in this article for the ICS cybersecurity will help facilitate the design and implementation of cyberattack-resilient ICSs in the networked world.

We formulate the problem within a game theoretic framework where the client needs to decide an optimal fusion strategy using both non-trusted information from the cloud and local trusted data, given that the adversary on the cloud is trying to deceive the client by biasing the output to a different value/set of values. We adopt an Iterated Best Response (IBR) scheme for each player to update its action based on the opponent's announced computation. At each iteration, the cloud reveals its output to the client, who then computes the best response as a linear combination of its private local estimate and of the untrusted cloud output. We characterize equilibrium conditions for both the scalar and vector cases of the computed value of interest. Necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence for the IBR are derived and insightful geometric interpretations of such conditions is discussed for the vector case.

Packet splitting tries to chop data into small packets, so that a system may not completely reassemble the packets for signature matching. Duplicate insertion can mislead a system if the system and the target host discard different TCP/IP packets with a duplicate offset or sequence. Payload mutation fools a system with a mutative payload. Shellcode mutation transforms an attacker's shellcode to escape signature detection. This study assesses the effectiveness of these techniques on three recent signature-based systems, and among them, explains why Snort can be evaded. The results indicate that duplicate insertion becomes less effective on recent systems, but packet splitting, payload mutation and shellcode mutation can be still effective against them.","1553-877X","","10.1109/SURV.2011.092311.00082","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6042389","IDS/IPS;evasion;attacks;signature","Payloads;IP networks;Computer crime;Handwriting recognition;Cryptography;Intrusion detection","","","","34","3","39","","13 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we explore resource depletion attacks at the routing protocol layer and packet forwarding, which invariably disable networks by quickly draining nodes power, is called “Vampire Attack”. These attacks are not specific to any protocol, but rather depend on the properties of many classes of routing protocols. In existing systems finding out the vampire attack is done at destination for each received packet. In our proposed system, we developed a system which mitigates these vampire attacks by saving bandwidth, power and time.

CPS constitute the backbone of enterprise (e.g., smart cities), industrial (e.g., smart manufacturing), and critical infrastructure (e.g., energy systems). Thus, their vital importance, interoperability, and plurality of computing devices make them prominent targets for malicious attacks aiming to disrupt their operations. Attacks targeting cyber-physical energy systems (CPES), given their mission-critical nature within the power grid infrastructure, can lead to disastrous consequences. The security of CPES can be enhanced by leveraging testbed capabilities in order to replicate and understand power systems operating conditions, discover vulnerabilities, develop security countermeasures, and evaluate grid operation under fault-induced or maliciously constructed scenarios. Adequately modeling and reproducing the behavior of CPS could be a challenging task. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the CPS security landscape with an emphasis on CPES. Specifically, we demonstrate a threat modeling methodology to accurately represent the CPS elements, their interdependencies, as well as the possible attack entry points and system vulnerabilities. Leveraging the threat model formulation, we present a CPS framework designed to delineate the hardware, software, and modeling resources required to simulate the CPS and construct high-fidelity models that can be used to evaluate the system's performance under adverse scenarios. The system performance is assessed using scenario-specific metrics, while risk assessment enables the system vulnerability prioritization factoring the impact on the system operation. The overarching framework for modeling, simulating, assessing, and mitigating attacks in a CPS is illustrated using four representative attack scenarios targeting CPES.

They are credible targets of active (e.g., terrorist) attacks since their disruption may lead to sizable losses economically and in human lives. It is thus crucial to develop decision support that can guide administrators in deploying defense resources for system security and reliability. Prior work on the defense of critical infrastructures has typically used static or Stackelberg games. These approaches view network interdictions as one-time events. However, infrastructure protection is also a continual process in which the defender and attacker interact to produce dynamic states affecting their best actions, as witnessed in the continual attack and defense of transmission networks in Colombia and Yemen. In this paper, we use zero-sum Markov games to model these interactions subject to underlying uncertainties of real-world events and actions. We solve equilibrium mixed strategies of the players that maximize their respective minimum payoffs with a time-decayed metric. We also show how the defender can use deception as a defense mechanism. Using results for a 5-bus system, a WECC 9-bus system, and an IEEE standard 14-bus system, we illustrate that our game model can provide useful insights. We also contrast our results with those of static games, and quantify the gain in defender payoff due to misinformation of the attacker.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2226480","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6378414","Markov games;power system security;smart grid communication networks","Games;Markov processes;Security;Game theory;Load modeling;Cost function;Power transmission lines","game theory;Markov processes;power grids;power system security;power transmission protection;power transmission reliability","Markov game analysis;power network attack-defense;electricity grids;decision support;defense resources;system security;system reliability;Stackelberg games;static games;infrastructure protection;dynamic states;transmission network continual attack-defense;Colombia;Yemen;zero-sum Markov games;equilibrium mixed strategies;defense mechanism;WECC 9-bus system;IEEE standard 14-bus system;game model","","61","","28","","11 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There is a growing emphasis towards developing an efficient intrusion detection system (IDS) to strengthen the security of the SCADA control system. This is a research-in-progress paper which presents the application of two anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (AbIDS) in detecting the stealthy cyber-attack on the SCADA control system. We have applied the IDS tools Snort and Bro, in designing the IDS and later, compared their performances in terms of detection rate and latency in the alert packets with a motive of selecting better IDS for the SCADA security. Specifically, the timing-based rule is applied to identify the malicious packets based on the high temporal frequency in the network traffic. For the case study, we have implemented the SCADA based protection scheme which performs an autonomous protection to mitigate the system disturbances.

In order to deploy WSNs in real environments, a variety of technical challenges must be addressed. With traditional techniques developed for a specific task, it is hard to react in dynamic situations beyond the scope of the intended task. As a solution to this problem, machine learning (ML) techniques that are able to handle dynamic situations with successful learning process have been applied lately in WSNs. Particularly, deep learning (DL) techniques, a class of ML techniques characterized by the use of deep neural network, are used for WSNs to extract higher level features from raw sensor data. A range of benefits obtained from ML techniques applied to WSNs can be described as reduced computational complexity, increased feasibility in finding optimal solutions, increased energy efficiency, etc. On the other hand, it is found from our survey that large training time and large dataset to get acceptable performance are accompanied with large energy consumption which is not favorable for resource-restrained WSNs. Reviews on the applications of ML techniques in WSNs appeared in the literature. However, few reviews have dealt with the applications of DL techniques in WSNs. In this review, recent developments of ML techniques for WSNs are presented with much emphasis on DL techniques.

Only a few semi-supervised methods utilize unlabeled data and a few labeled anomalies to train models. However, these kinds of methods usually encounter two problems: (i) since anomalies usually have different behavior patterns or the internal mechanisms that produce anomalies are complex and diverse, a few labeled anomalies cannot cover all anomaly types; and (ii) the amount of unlabeled data in the training set is substantially greater than the amount of labeled data, which leads to that unlabeled data with contamination often dominates the training process. To solve these two problems, we propose the semi-supervised anomaly detection method named ConNet and a new loss function named concentration loss. Specifically, ConNet consists of two stages. Firstly, we obtain the prior anomaly score of unlabeled data via prior estimation module and attach the prior anomaly score to unlabeled data as the training weight. Then, an anomaly scoring network is training to assign anomaly scores to data instances, which can ensure that the anomaly scores of anomalies significantly deviate from those of normal instances. We have conducted experiments on thirteen real-world data sets and tested the performance of our method in terms of detection accuracy, utilization efficiency of labeled data, and robustness to different contamination rates. The experimental results show that the performance of our method is significantly better than those of the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3077014","science and technology program “Research on business application transformation to the cloud and full-link operation analysis technology” of State Grid Corporation of China(grant numbers:5700-202152169A-0-0-00); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9420659","Data mining;anomaly detection;deep learning;outlier detection","Anomaly detection;Training;Task analysis;Contamination;Labeling;Feature extraction;Deep learning","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","ConNet;prior anomaly score;unlabeled data;training weight;anomaly scoring network;anomaly scores;data instances;real-world data sets;state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods;deep semisupervised anomaly detection;existing semisupervised anomaly detection methods;labeled normal data;high labeling costs;semisupervised methods;labeled anomalies;anomaly types;training set;training process;anomaly detection method","","","","40","CCBY","3 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This has become a major challenge for malware researchers and analysts. Current defensive analysis of anti-forensic malware often requires painstaking step-by-step manual inspection. Code obfuscation may further complicate proper analysis. Furthermore, current defensive countermeasures are usually effective only against anti-forensic techniques which have already been identified. In this paper we propose a new method to detect and classify anti-forensic behavior, by comparing the trace-logs of the suspect program between different environments. Unlike previous works, the presented method is essentially noninvasive (does not interfere with original program flow). We separately trace the flow of instructions (Opcode) and the flow of Input-Output operations (IO). The two dimensions (Opcode and IO) complement each other to provide reliable classification. Our method can identify split behavior of suspected programs without prior knowledge of any specific anti-forensic technique; furthermore, it relieves the malware analyst from tedious step-by-step inspection. Those features are critical in the modern Cyber arena, where rootkits and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are constantly adopting new sophisticated anti-forensic techniques to deceive analysis.","","978-1-4799-2535-3","10.1109/MALWARE.2013.6703679","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6703679","","Malware;Forensics;Virtual machining;Runtime;Software;Monitoring;Hardware","input-output programs;invasive software;system monitoring","noninvasive anti forensic malware detection;malicious programs;dynamic analysis;forensic instrumentation detection;anti forensic malware defensive analysis;code obfuscation;trace-log comparison;Opcode;input-output operations;Cyber arena;advanced persistent threats;APT","","4","","26","","9 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the addressed scenario, the defender aims at deciding whether a test sequence has been drawn according to a discrete memoryless source X ~ P<sub>X</sub>, whose statistics are known to him through the observation of a training sequence generated by X. In order to undermine the correct decision under the alternative hypothesis that the test sequence has not been drawn from X, the attacker can modify a sequence produced by a source Y ~ P<sub>Y</sub> up to a certain distortion and corrupt the training sequence either by adding some fake samples or by replacing some samples with fake ones. We derive the unique rationalizable equilibrium of the two versions of the game in the asymptotic regime and by assuming that the defender makes his decision by relying only on the first order statistics of the test and the training sequences. By mimicking Stein's lemma, we derive the best achievable performance for the defender when the first type error probability is required to tend to zero exponentially fast with an arbitrarily small, yet positive, error exponent. We then use such a result to analyze the ultimate distinguishability of any two sources as a function of the allowed distortion and the fraction of corrupted samples injected into the training sequence.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2018.2806742","research sponsored by the DARPA and the Air Force Research Laboratory(grant numbers:FA8750-16-2-0173); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8292879","Hypothesis testing;adversarial signal processing;cybersecurity;game theory;source identification;optimal transportation theory;earth mover distance;adversarial learning;Sanov’s theorem","Training;Games;Error probability;Distortion;Training data;Electronic mail;Security","decision theory;error statistics;game theory;signal processing;statistical testing","corrupted training;training data;test sequence;discrete memoryless source;training sequence;adversarial source identification game;unique rationalizable equilibrium;first order statistics;asymptotic regime;Stein lemma;error probability;error exponent","","5","","42","IEEE","15 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a novel approach that uses system logs to detect insider behavior using a special recurrent neural network (RNN) model. Ground truth is established using DANTE and used as baseline for identifying anomalous behavior. For this, system logs are modeled as a natural language sequence and patterns are extracted from these sequences. We create workflows of sequences of actions that follow a natural language logic and control flow. These flows are assigned various categories of behaviors - malignant or benign. Any deviation from these sequences indicates the presence of a threat. We further classify threats into one of the five categories provided in the CERT insider threat dataset.

In this paper, we propose an approach based on deep learning referred to as TrafficGAN, which analyzes (HTTP) traffic sessions to distinguish between malware-related and normal traffic. We first try to explore traffic patterns of malware variants by adding noise and category condition to the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), thus generating various similar but slightly different traffic. And then, we use discriminative model to seek the deviation between abnormal traffic and normal traffic by extracting the essential difference. Notablely, we increase the diversity of data by generating samples adversarially, which enhances the robustness of the system to detect zero-day attacks and highlights the lack of sensitive data in the security community.

Given the importance of the oil and gas sector on the global economy and the diversity of critical systems often being controlled over remote locations, it is highly important to understand and mitigate such attacks. In this paper, we survey cyber-attacks on all three domains of the oil and gas sector (upstream, midstream, downstream) starting from the early 90s up until 2020. For each domain, we document and analyze verified attacks based on real-world reports and published demo attacks on systems. We map and catalogue the attack types used in each case, in order to understand common and subliminal attack paths against oil and gas critical operations. Our aim is threefold, i.e., first, to assess documented attacks using standardized impact assessment techniques and highlight potential consequences of cyber-attacks on this sector, second, to build a vulnerability taxonomy based on technical knowledge gathered by all such incidents and connect each vulnerability with oil and gas systems and respective attack paths, and third, to map the documented knowledge and taxonomies with MITRE's international knowledge base of Adversary Tactics and Techniques, so as to provide a general guide for analyzing and protecting against cyber-attacks at oil and gas infrastructures.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3007960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9136701","Cybersecurity;cyberattack;oil and gas;critical infrastructure;refinery;operational technology;information technology;vulnerability;impact;risk;safety;survey","Oils;Integrated circuits;Taxonomy;Computer security;Industries;Critical infrastructure","gas industry;invasive software;petroleum industry","oil & gas sector;attack patterns;information technology systems;interconnected systems;vulnerable accessible device;critical systems;verified attacks;published demo attacks;attack types;common attack paths;subliminal attack paths;gas critical operations;documented attacks;gas systems;respective attack paths;gas infrastructures;cyber-attacks;incident assessment","","1","","135","CCBY","8 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Yet one of the biggest challenges is that ML-based IDSs suffer from adversarial example (AE) attacks. By applying small perturbations (e.g. slightly increasing packet inter-arrival time) to the intrusion traffic, an AE attack can flip the prediction of a well-trained IDS. We address this challenge by proposing MANDA, a MANifold and Decision boundary-based AE detection system. Through analyzing AE attacks, we notice that 1) an AE tends to be close to its original manifold (i.e., the cluster of samples in its original class) regardless which class it is misclassified into; and 2) AEs tend to be close to the decision boundary so as to minimize the perturbation scale. Based on the two observations, we design MANDA for accurate AE detection by exploiting inconsistency between manifold evaluation and IDS model inference and evaluating model uncertainty on small perturbations. We evaluate MANDA on NSL-KDD under three state-of-the-art AE attacks. Our experimental results show that MANDA achieves as high as 98.41% true-positive rate with 5% false-positive rate and can be applied to other problem spaces such as image recognition.","2641-9874","978-1-6654-0325-2","10.1109/INFOCOM42981.2021.9488874","Office of Naval Research; National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9488874","","Manifolds;Uncertainty;Image recognition;Perturbation methods;Conferences;Network intrusion detection;Detectors","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence)","MANDA;network intrusion detection system;adversarial example detection;IDS model inference;manifold evaluation;perturbation scale;decision boundary;AE attack;intrusion traffic;packet inter-arrival time;adversarial example attacks;ML-based IDS;ML-based intrusion detection systems;machine learning","","1","","47","","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Common applications include its use for military operations, monitoring environmental conditions (such as volcano detection, agriculture, and management), distributed control systems, healthcare, and the detection of radioactive sources. Notwithstanding its promising attributes, security in WSN is a big challenge and remains an ongoing research trend. Deployed sensor nodes are vulnerable to various security attacks due to its architecture, hostile deployment location, and insecure routing protocol. Furthermore, the sensor nodes in WSNs are characterized by their resource constraints, such as, limited energy, low bandwidth, short communication range, limited processing, and storage capacity, which have made the sensor nodes an easy target. Therefore, in this paper, we present a review of denial of service attacks that affect resource availability in WSN and their countermeasure by presenting a taxonomy.

Many approaches have been proposed to extract principal indicators from the vast sea of data to represent the entire system state. Detecting anomalies using these indicators on time prevent potential accidents and economic losses. Anomaly detection in multivariate time series data poses a particular challenge because it requires simultaneous consideration of temporal dependencies and relationships between variables. Recent deep learning-based works have made impressive progress in this field. They are highly capable of learning representations of the large-scaled sequences in an unsupervised manner and identifying anomalies from the data. However, most of them are highly specific to the individual use case and thus require domain knowledge for appropriate deployment. This review provides a background on anomaly detection in time-series data and reviews the latest applications in the real world. Also, we comparatively analyze state-of-the-art deep-anomaly-detection models for time series with several benchmark datasets.

LAD has become a promising technology to tackle this problem. However, the security of the defense mechanism itself is often neglected as LAD mainly focuses on fortifying the protected target. This would allow a new deductive attack to encroach on LADs by inferring and undermining defense strategy, and then the whole defense mechanism can be completely invalidated once for all. Such a problem leads to the urgent need to develop new defense technologies with self-protection capability. In this article, we propose a new endogenous security defense mechanism named LSSM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide a systematic defense structure with endogenous security to resist deductive attacks. We first review the existing learning-enhanced active defense mechanisms and compare their pros and cons. Then the methodology of LSSM is illustrated targeting two major threats posed by deductive attacks. Experimental results highlight the performance of our method.

The current Markov decision process (MDP) or stochastic games based solutions suffer from several weaknesses: (i) The MDP- based approach is unable to explicitly model the opponents; (ii) The Nash equilibrium approach of stochastic games cannot handle the condition with multi equilibria. Existing studies have not considered the cognitive ability of the agent and lack of explicit opponent modeling. Inspired by recursive reasoning, this paper introduces a theory of mind (ToM)-based stochastic game-theoretic approach to reason about the beliefs and behaviors of the attackers. Each agent maintains different order ToM beliefs concerning his opponent with explicit opponent modeling. In order to accurately predict the attacker's action with nested beliefs, we utilize the Bayesian attack graph (BAG) to model multi-step attacks scenarios. In addition, the agent is allowed to learn from new information to adjust his beliefs and learning speed. Simulation results validate that ToM modeling performs well in the intrusion response system than random defense actions. Besides, a defender with first-order ToM beliefs always wins an attacker with zero-order ToM beliefs.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9013291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9013291","","Games;Bayes methods;Stochastic processes;Predictive models;Game theory;Measurement","decision making;game theory;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;security of data;stochastic games","ToM modeling;intrusion response system;first-order ToM beliefs;zero-order ToM beliefs;first-order theory;sophisticated network intrusions;sequential decision-making problem;autonomous agents;current Markov decision process;MDP;stochastic games;Nash equilibrium approach;explicit opponent modeling;mind-based stochastic game-theoretic approach;different order ToM beliefs;attacker;Bayesian attack graph;attacks scenarios","","","","14","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we propose a new intrusion detection system for CAN which is based on monitoring the propagation time of the physical signals sent on the bus. Indeed, quite a number of recent works addressed the use of physical or timing characteristics to identify network nodes or to create covert channels. In our approach, by accounting for intrinsic delay characteristics of the bus and by monitoring the difference in signal arrival time at the two bus ends, we can identify nodes by location-related differential delays and provide relevant information for estimating the relative location of a transmitter node on the bus. The results of our experimental evaluation show that our approach provides very high identification rates and accurate localization in case of attacks from compromised nodes. The ability to detect attacks that replace an existing node or plug new adversarial nodes on the bus is also illustrated along with discussions on estimating sender location in these cases.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2985326","Romanian Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI, within PNCDI III(grant numbers:PN-III-P1-1.1-PD-2016-1198); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9054971","Automotive engineering;communication system security;intrusion detection;physical layer","Intrusion detection;Physical layer;Proposals;Transmitters;Delays","computer network security;controller area networks;synchronisation","timing based intrusion detection and localization;differential TIDAL;Controller Area Network;transmitter node;location-related differential delays;signal arrival time;intrinsic delay characteristics;intrusion detection system;intruder node;node replacement;network nodes;physical layer characteristics","","2","","35","CCBY","2 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Though there are various deep learning (DL) methods suggested for securing in-vehicle networks, recent studies on adversarial examples have shown that attackers can easily fool DL models. In this research, we further explore adversarial examples in an in-vehicle network. We first discover and implement two adversarial attack models that are harmful to a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based detection model used in the in-vehicle network. As shown in our experiments, adversaries can attack the LSTM-based detection model with a success rate of over 98%.

This paper proposes a novel method for automatic and timely analysis of traffic generated by large networks, which is able to identify malicious external hosts even if their activities do not raise any alert by existing defensive systems. Our proposal focuses on periodic communications, since our experimental evaluation shows that they are more related to malicious activities, and it can be easily integrated with other detection systems. We highlight that periodic network activities can occur at very different intervals ranging from seconds to hours, hence a timely analysis of long time-windows of the traffic generated by large organizations is a challenging task in itself. Existing work is primarily focused on identifying botnets, whereas the method proposed in this paper has a broader target and aims to detect external hosts that are likely involved in any malicious operation. Since malware-related network activities can be considered as rare events in the overall traffic, the output of the proposed method is a manageable graylist of external hosts that are characterized by a considerably higher likelihood of being malicious compared to the entire set of external hosts contacted by the monitored large network. A thorough evaluation on a real large network traffic demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal, which is capable of automatically selecting only dozens of suspicious hosts from hundreds of thousands, thus allowing security operators to focus their analyses on few likely malicious targets.","","978-1-5386-1465-5","10.1109/NCA.2017.8171326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8171326","beaconing;periodicity;graylist;clustering","Time series analysis;Proposals;Security;Malware;Noise measurement;Monitoring","computer network security;invasive software;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","malicious targets;periodic communications;Network Intrusion Detection Systems;malicious external hosts;defensive systems;experimental evaluation;malicious activities;periodic network activities;identifying botnets;malicious operation;malware-related network activities;monitored large network;network traffic;suspicious hosts;malicious hosts","","8","","24","","11 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the rising connectivity exposes a defenseless internal Controller Area Network (CAN) to cyberattacks. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a supervisory module, proposed for identifying CAN network malicious messages, without modifying legacy ECUs and causing high traffic overhead. The traditional IDS approaches rely on time and frequency thresholding, leading to high false alarm rates, whereas state-of-the-art solutions may suffer from vehicle dependency. This paper presents a wavelet-based approach to locating the behavior change in the CAN traffic by analyzing the CAN network's transmission pattern. The proposed Wavelet-based Intrusion Detection System (WINDS) is tested on various attack scenarios, using real vehicle traffic from two independent research centers, while being expanded toward more comprehensive attack scenarios using synthetic attacks. The technique is evaluated and compared against the state-of-the-art solutions and the baseline frequency method.

There is only one trusted authority to distribute keys to the sensor nodes and the users. Compromising the single authority can undermine the whole network. We propose a fully distributed access control method, which has several authorities instead of one. Each sensor has a set of attributes and each user has an access structure of attributes. A message from a sensor is encrypted such that only a user with matching set of attributes can decrypt. Compared to, our schemes need simpler access structure which make secret key distribution more computation efficient, when user rights are modified. We prove that our scheme can tolerate compromising all but one distribution centers, which independently distribute their contributions to a single user key. Our scheme do not increase the computation and communication costs of the sensors, making it highly desirable for fine grained access control.","1530-2075","978-1-61284-372-8","10.1109/IPDPS.2011.42","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6012806","","Access control;Public key;Encryption;Polynomials;Receivers;Temperature sensors","authorisation;cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","distributed fine-grained access control;wireless sensor network;attribute based encryption primitive;cryptographic primitive","","29","","33","","8 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

AI techniques excel in some situational understanding tasks; for instance, classifying intrusions. However, existing AI systems are often overconfident in their classification: this reduces the trust of human analysts. Furthermore, sophisticated intrusions span across long time periods to reduce their footprint, and each decision to respond to a (suspected) attack can have unintended side effects. In this position paper we show how advanced AI systems handling uncertainty and encompassing expert knowledge can lessen the burden on human analysts. In detail: (1) Effective interaction with the analyst is a key issue for the success of an intelligence support system. This involves two issues: a clear and unambiguous system-analyst communication, only possible if both share the same domain ontology and conceptual framework, and effective interaction, allowing the analyst to query the system for justifications of the reasoning path followed and the results obtained. (2) Uncertainty-aware machine learning and reasoning is an effective method for anomaly detection, which can provide human operators with alternative interpretations of data with an accurate assessment of their confidence. This can contribute to reducing misunderstandings and building trust. (3) An event-processing algorithm including both a neural and a symbolic layer can help identify attacks spanning long intervals of time, that would remain undetected via a pure neural approach. (4) Such a symbolic layer is crucial for the human operator to estimate the appropriateness of possible responses to a suspected attack by considering both the probability that an attack is actually occurring and the impact (intended and unintended) of a given response.","2325-5374","978-9916-9565-5-7","10.23919/CyCon51939.2021.9468294","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9468294","cyber threat intelligence;machine learning;artificial intelligence","Uncertainty;Buildings;Semantics;Tools;Complexity theory;Artificial intelligence;Task analysis","expert systems;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);ontologies (artificial intelligence);security of data;uncertainty handling","artificial intelligence;cyber security operations;AI systems;expert knowledge;intelligence support system;reasoning path;viral cyber threats;uncertainty handling;system-analyst communication;uncertainty-aware machine learning;self-aware effective identification;self-aware effective response;domain ontology","","","","47","","5 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we adopt the Edge Pattern Detection (EPD) algorithm to design a novel poisoning method that attack against several machine learning algorithms used in IDSs. Specifically, we propose a boundary pattern detection algorithm to efficiently generate the points that are near to abnormal data but considered to be normal ones by current classifiers. Then, we introduce a Batch-EPD Boundary Pattern (BEBP) detection algorithm to overcome the limitation of the number of edge pattern points generated by EPD and to obtain more useful adversarial samples. Based on BEBP, we further present a moderate but effective poisoning method called chronic poisoning attack.

However, DLNNs themselves have been recently found vulnerable to attacks called adversarial examples and backdoor attacks for image recognition applications. In this work, we present an effective defense method for DLNN based IDS by using Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the generation of triggers neurons selected based on their response to the features to produce the output. We embed the GA-Trigger-Detection neurons within the model to detect and prevent white-box advertorial examples and backdoor attacks against two DLNNs based IDS: Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Stacked Sparse AutoEncoder Based Extreme Learning Machine (SSAELM). We implement two white-box adversarial examples and backdoor attacks from prior work and use them to investigate the proposed defense method. We show that the defense method is sufficient to defend against sophisticated attackers with 99% success rate and only 1% degrade in accuracy. We then show that it successfully weakens backdoor attacks on the two DNN architectures using two benchmark datasets: KDDCUP'99 and Kyoto.

The autoencoder shows strong intrusion detection performance with accuracy greater than 92.5% on zeroday attack packets. A real-time online incremental learning and anomaly detection system is also designed using the effective anomaly detection abilities of the AE. The learning system uses two autoencoders, one AE is pretrained for classifying network packets as normal and malicious, and the second AE is initialized with random weights and learns malicious data incrementally. Thus, this system is able to flag new attack classes during runtime. The real-time intrusion detection system performs with an accuracy greater than 89.7%.

A key challenge for attackers is to install their malware programs on as many victim machines as possible. HTTP protocol, being the most popular protocol and occupying a significant portion of network traffic, is an obvious target for attackers to exploit for malware distribution. Advanced attackers would even hide the malicious executable program behind a benign file such as text, image. The existence of malware becomes harder to detect and the distribution channels become more evasive (i.e., not clear to identify). However, the exploited and hidden behavior often leads to an inconsistency between the actual content type and the declared content type. In this paper, we conduct a detailed study on a seven-month traffic of content type inconsistency executable program downloaded from an ISP of CSTNET (China Science and Technology Network). We found that 99.78% (891/893) of PE (portable executable) files declared to be images are malicious and 100% of PE files declared to be text with typical file extensions, “.pdf”, “.doc”, “.css” are malware. So, content type inconsistency can be used to detect evasive network attacks as well as effectively discover unknown malware from the traffic.","2374-9628","978-1-5090-6468-7","10.1109/PCCC.2017.8280450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8280450","Malware;HTTP;Content-type;Inconsistency;Evasive attack","Malware;Protocols;Servers;Videos;Firewalls (computing);Browsers","computer network security;Internet;invasive software;transport protocols","China Science and Technology Network;malware identification;unknown malware;evasive network attacks;typical file extensions;portable executable;PE files;content type inconsistency executable program;seven-month traffic;declared content type;actual content type;hidden behavior;exploited behavior;distribution channels;benign file;malicious executable program;malware distribution;network traffic;HTTP protocol;victim machines;malware programs;severe security threats;header-payload comparison;HTTP content type inconsistency","","","","17","","5 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Being common and easier targets due to low power and low processing capabilities, lightweight firewall, and availability for service, IoT devices require lightweight but enhanced security to thwart different cyber attacks. In this paper, we champion for hardware-assisted defense mechanisms against cyber attacks in IoT domain.

To enable similar cyber behaviors as in operational systems, the cyber training platforms must incorporate realism of operation for the system the cyber workforce desires to protect. The system's realism is obtained by constructing training models that include a broad range of system and specific device-level fidelity. However, for cyber training purposes the training platform must go beyond computer network topology and computer host model fidelity - it must include realistic models of cyber intrusions and attacks to enable the realism necessary for training purposes. In this position paper we discuss the benefits that such a cyber training platform provides, to include a discussion on the challenges of creating, deploying, and maintaining the platform itself.

For instance, Stealthy Link Flooding Attack (SLFA) is a variant of DDoS attacks that strives to block access to a target area by flooding a small set of links, and it is shown that it can bypass traditional DDoS defense mechanisms. One potential solution to tackle such SLFAs is to apply Moving Target Defense (MTD) techniques in which network settings are dynamically changed to confuse/deceive attackers, thus making it highly expensive to launch a successful attack. However, since MTD comes with some overhead to the network, to find the best strategy (i.e., when and/or to what extent) of applying it has been a major challenge. The strategy is significantly influenced by the attacker's behavior that is often difficult to guess. In this work, we address the challenge of obtaining the optimal MTD strategy that effectively mitigates SLFAs while incurs a minimal overhead. We design the problem as a signaling game considering the network defender and the attacker as players. A belief function is established throughout the engagement of the attacker and the defender during this SLFA campaign, which is utilized to pick the best response/action for each player. We analyze the game model and derive a defense mechanism based on the equilibria of the game. We evaluate the technique on a Mininet-based network environment where an attacker is performing SLFAs and a defender applies MTD based on equilibria of the game. The results show that our signaling game-based dynamic defense mechanism can provide a similar level of protection against SLFAs like the extensive MTD solution, however, causing a significantly reduced overhead.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2021.3052090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9328143","Crossfire attack;moving target defense;signaling game;stealthy link flooding attack.","Games;Servers;Routing;Computer crime;Software;Packet loss;Network reconnaissance","computer network security;game theory;security of data","signaling game-based dynamic defense mechanism;extensive MTD solution;strategic defense;signaling game approach;distributed denial-of-service attacks;fully protected network;DDoS attacks;traditional DDoS defense mechanisms;target defense techniques;network settings;successful attack;optimal MTD strategy;network defender;Mininet-based network environment;stealthy link flooding attack;stealthy link flooding attacks;SLFA","","","","43","IEEE","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, recent studies show that machine learning models are vulnerable to various attacks, which will compromise the security of the models themselves and the application systems. Moreover, such attacks are stealthy due to the unexplained nature of the deep learning models. In this survey, we systematically analyze the security issues of machine learning, focusing on existing attacks on machine learning systems, corresponding defenses or secure learning techniques, and security evaluation methods. Instead of focusing on one stage or one type of attack, this paper covers all the aspects of machine learning security from the training phase to the test phase. First, the machine learning model in the presence of adversaries is presented, and the reasons why machine learning can be attacked are analyzed. Then, the machine learning security-related issues are classified into five categories: training set poisoning; backdoors in the training set; adversarial example attacks; model theft; recovery of sensitive training data. The threat models, attack approaches, and defense techniques are analyzed systematically. To demonstrate that these threats are real concerns in the physical world, we also reviewed the attacks in real-world conditions.

Focusing on the lack of training images of grape leaf diseases, this paper proposes a novel model named Leaf GAN, which is based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), to generate images of four different grape leaf diseases for training identification models. A generator model with degressive channels is first designed to generate grape leaf disease images; then, the dense connectivity strategy and instance normalization are fused into an efficient discriminator to identify real and fake disease images by utilizing their excellent feature extraction capability on grape leaf lesions. Finally, the deep regret gradient penalty method is applied to stabilize the training process of the model. Using a total of 4,062 grape leaf disease images, the Leaf GAN model ultimately generates 8,124 grape leaf disease images. The generated grape leaf disease images based on Leaf GAN model can obtain better performance than DCGAN and WGAN in terms of the Fréchet inception distance. The experimental results show that the proposed Leaf GAN model generates sufficient grape leaf disease images with prominent lesions, providing a feasible solution for the data augmentation of grape leaf disease images. For the eight prevailing classification models with the expanded dataset, the identification performance based on CNNs indicated higher accuracies, whereby all the accuracies were better than those of the initial dataset with other data augmentation methods. Among them, Xception achieves a recognition accuracy of 98.70% on the testing set. The results demonstrate that the proposed data augmentation method represents a new approach to overcoming the overfitting problem in disease identification and can effectively improve the identification accuracy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2998839","Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2019ZDLNY07-06-01); Ningxia Smart Agricultural Industry Technology Collaborative Innovation Center(grant numbers:2017DC53); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2452019064); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602388,61902339); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2017M613216); Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2017JM6059); Postdoctoral Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2016BSHEDZZ121); Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Intelligent Processing for Big Energy Data; Yan’an University(grant numbers:IPBED14); Doctoral Starting Up Foundation of Yan’an University(grant numbers:YDBK2019-06); Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of Northwest A&F University of China(grant numbers:201910712048); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9104723","Generative adversarial networks;convolutional neural networks;data augmentation;grape leaf disease identification","Diseases;Pipelines;Generators;Gallium nitride;Training;Feature extraction;Generative adversarial networks","agricultural products;convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;gradient methods;image classification;image colour analysis;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);plant diseases","Leaf GAN model;sufficient grape leaf disease images;generative adversarial networks;grape leaf disease identification;grape leaf lesions;grape leaf disease images;data augmentation method;grape industry;deep learning;training identification models;generator model;dense connectivity strategy;degressive channels;instance normalization;feature extraction;deep regret gradient penalty method;DCGAN;WGAN;Fréchet inception distance;classification models;expanded dataset;CNNs;Xception;testing set;overfitting problem","","16","","58","CCBY","1 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, vulnerabilities and incorrect configuration increase the potential for attacks. Provable verification and simulation tools have been introduced to eliminate configuration conflicts and weaknesses, which can increase system robustness against attacks. Most of these tools require special knowledge in formal methods and precise specification for requirements in special languages, in addition to their excessive need for computing resources. Video games have been utilized by researchers to make educational software more attractive and engaging. Publishing these games for crowdsourcing can also stimulate competition between players and increase the game educational value. In this paper we introduce a game interface, called NetMaze, that represents the network configuration verification problem as a video game and allows for attack analysis. We aim to make the security analysis and hardening usable and accurately achievable, using the power of video games and the wisdom of crowdsourcing. Players can easily discover weaknesses in network configuration and investigate new attack scenarios. In addition, the gameplay scenarios can also be used to analyze and learn attack attribution considering human factors. In this paper, we present a provable mapping from the network configuration to 3D game objects.","","978-1-4799-5890-0","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997493","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997493","","Games;Security;Network topology;Conferences;Communication networks;Computational modeling;Topology","computer games;courseware;formal verification;human factors;security of data;specification languages;user interfaces","security configuration analytics;video games;computing systems;security configuration settings;security property;vulnerability;provable verification;simulation tool;configuration conflict;system robustness;formal methods;special languages;educational software;crowdsourcing;game educational value;game interface;NetMaze;network configuration verification problem;attack analysis;security analysis;gameplay scenario;attack attribution;human factor;provable mapping;3D game object","","","","23","","29 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Image recognition is also used in various fields with high performance by incorporating deep learning technology. However, deep learning technology is vulnerable to evasion attacks that cause the model to be misclassified by modulating the original image. In this paper, we generate an adversarial example using the forward-backward-splitting iterative procedure. Then perform an evasion attack on the show and tell model.","1738-9445","979-11-88428-04-5","10.23919/ICACT48636.2020.9061558","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9061558","AI;Security;Adversarial example;Evasion attack;Show and tell model","Machine learning;Modulation;Data models;Computer science;Image recognition;Computer security","image recognition;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","evasion attack;deep learning technology;forward-backward-splitting iterative procedure;show and tell model","","","","8","","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The limitations of these devices impedes the usage of conventional security methods. However, physical layer security (PLS) has many diverse techniques that do not require significant resources that can be used to bolster the defenses of these devices. Due to the heterogeneity in IoT, we first consider relevant IoT communication protocols that are being used (WiFi, ZigBee, LoRaWAN) to connect these devices, and then the scope of surveyed PLS techniques is narrowed-down to a set of promising techniques that can be applied with the communication protocol. In this paper we explore recent developments in PLS techniques that require minimal to no overhead in their implementation, and provide security against some of the attacks that IoT devices and networks are vulnerable against: spoofing, jamming and eavesdropping attacks. The solutions explored include radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting, spread spectrum coding, and beamforming.","","978-1-6654-4431-6","10.1109/WF-IoT51360.2021.9595025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9595025","Internet of Things (IoT);physical layer security (PLS);RF fingerprinting;spread spectrum;beamforming;directional modulation","Radio frequency;Protocols;Array signal processing;Zigbee;Fingerprint recognition;Physical layer security;Transceivers","","","","","","27","","9 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
