Face presentation attacks try to deceive the machine learning-based system via malicious inputs to the sensor employing tools such as a face mask or photo. Presentation attacks threaten the deployment of face recognition systems to the real-world since security is a priority for an authentication system. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) based Spatiotemporal Autoencoder model. The proposed model only employs the real samples to train the model by minimizing the reconstruction error. The model learns to reconstruct real samples; thus, reconstruct attack samples with higher reconstruction error. The model classifies whether a sample is genuine or not via the scoring function based on the reconstruction error. The proposed model reduces the half total error rate by 22% compared to the commonly used methods in the literature.","2165-0608","978-1-7281-7206-4","10.1109/SIU49456.2020.9302402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9302402","Deep learning;autoencoder;spatiotemporal information;face presentation attack","Faces;Face recognition;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Biological system modeling;Authentication;Anomaly detection;Tools","authorisation;biometrics (access control);convolutional neural nets;face recognition;image classification;image reconstruction;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;recurrent neural nets","face presentation attack detection;reconstruction error minimization;biometric authentication systems;machine learning-based system;malicious inputs;face mask;face recognition systems;authentication system;Convolutional Long Short Term Memory;spatiotemporal autoencoder model;sensor;ConvLSTM;scoring function;half total error rate","","","","","","7 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Classical encryption techniques have been employed to ensure the data security of the IoT network. However, high-level encryption techniques cannot be employed in IoT devices due to the limitation of resources. In addition, node security is still a challenge for network engineers. Thus, we need to explore a complete solution for IoT networks that can ensure nodes and data security.

This change brings with it some inevitable problems. Increasing human population and growing transportation-needs result many accidents in urban and rural areas, and this recursively results extra traffic problems and fuel consumption. It is obvious that the issues brought by this spiral loop needed to be solved with the use of some new technological achievements. In this context, self-driving cars or automated vehicles concepts are seen as a good solution. However, this also brings some additional problems with it. Currently many cars are provided with some digital security systems, which are examined in two phases, internal and external. These systems are constructed in the car by using some type of embedded system (such as the Controller Area Network (CAN)) which are needed to be protected form outsider cyberattacks. These attack can be detected by several ways such as rule based system, anomaly based systems, list based systems, etc. The current literature showed that researchers focused on the use of some artificial intelligence techniques for the detection of this type of attack. In this study, an intrusion detection system based on machine learning is proposed for the CAN security, which is the in-vehicle communication structure. As a result of the study, it has been observed that the decision tree-based ensemble learning models results the best performance in the tested models. Additionally, all models have a very good accuracy levels.","","978-1-7281-6851-7","10.1109/ICCCNT49239.2020.9225442","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9225442","machine learning;intrusion detection system;can bus;smart car","Automobiles;Wireless communication;Neural networks;Security;Machine learning;Intrusion detection;Communication systems","automobiles;controller area networks;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;traffic engineering computing;transportation","transportation;urban areas;rural areas;fuel consumption;spiral loop;technological achievements;self-driving cars;automated vehicles concepts;car;digital security systems;embedded system;controller area network;rule based system;list based systems;in-vehicle communication structure;vehicle intrusion detection system;machine learning;transportation technologies;decision tree-based ensemble learning;outsider cyberattacks;artificial intelligence","","1","","18","","15 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We demonstrate the improvements of MMT in comparison with other similar tools. Especially, we assess MMT to deal with a practical case-study in which we analyze the User-Agent field in HTTP headers to determine abnormal activities. Indeed, novel observations figure out the usefulness of the User-Agent field in HTTP requests as a good source to facilitate abnormal activities detection within an abundant traffic. There are eventually several researches alarming the vulnerabilities of the User-Agent field and proposing some manual solution including a combination of tools. However, existing countermeasures are rather passive and do not allow real-time detection. In the context of our research, MMT provides an automated detection of malicious traffic abusing vulnerable User-Agent field. Analyzing abnormal User-Agent strings is also useful to rapidly detect existing evil objects in the network (e.g., bots).

Honeyfolder is a decoy folder modeled using Social Leopard Algorithm (SoLA), especially for getting attacked and acting as an early warning system to alert the user during the suspicious file activities. AuditWatch is an Entropy module that verifies the entropy of the files and folders. CEP engine is used to aggregate data from different security systems to confirm the ransomware behavior, attack pattern, and promptly respond to them.

The first agent, the host agent, is responsible for monitoring the system behavior of the running host and raising an alarm for any anomalies. The second agent, the network agent, monitors the network traffic to extract any malicious patterns. The integrated approach improves both the detection ratio and accuracy. However, each approach cannot separately achieve the same performance as the proposed RAT-Bots detection framework. The performance of the introduced framework is evaluated by using real-world benchmark datasets.

The algorithms that exist in the field of AIS exploit the immune system's characteristics of learning and memory to solve diverse problems. We further present our approach by employing an architecture where host OS and a virtual machine (VM) layer actively collaborate to guarantee kernel integrity.

In this paper, we address the challenge of designing and deploying in a real operational setting an efficient privacy-preserving explorer for genetic cohorts. Our solution is built on top of the i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside) framework and leverages cutting-edge privacy-enhancing technologies such as homomorphic encryption and differential privacy. Solutions involving homomorphic encryption are often believed to be costly and immature for use in operational environments. Here, we show that, for specific applications, homomorphic encryption is actually a very efficient enabler. Indeed, our solution outperforms prior work by enabling a researcher to securely compute simple statistics on more than 3,000 encrypted genetic variants simultaneously for a cohort of 5,000 individuals in less than 5 seconds with commodity hardware.

Among the security solutions that we can find in the market, Intrusion Detection Systems monitor inbound and outbound network activity, identifying suspicious traffic. IDS compare typical network activity with daily network activity, searching for anomalous traffic. If the IDS detects anomalous traffic, it sends an alert. In this work, we propose a Bayesian network classifier, which can detect normal or anomalous traffic. Through our Bayesian network model, it is possible to describe the cause-effect relationships that exist between the traffic features. Due to the high dimensionality of the data, and to the widespread use of the networks, we used a flow-level analysis, which saved a considerable computational load. We focus on network worms and brute force attacks, using the datasets of UNB ISCX IDS 2012 and UAN W32.Worms 2008.

Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), which are mainly developed to support information technology systems, count vastly on predefined models and are trained mostly on specific cyber-attacks. Besides, most IDSs do not consider the imbalanced nature of ICS datasets, thereby suffering from low accuracy and high false-positive when being put to use. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model to construct new balanced representations of the imbalanced datasets. The new representations are fed into an ensemble deep learning attack detection model specifically designed for an ICS environment. The proposed attack detection model leverages Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Decision Tree (DT) classifiers to detect cyber-attacks from the new representations. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated based on 10-fold cross-validation on two real ICS datasets. The results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional classifiers, including Random Forest (RF), DNN, and AdaBoost, as well as recent existing models in the literature. The proposed approach is a generalized technique, which can be implemented in existing ICS infrastructures with minimum effort.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2992249","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9086038","Cyber-attacks;critical infrastructure;industrial control system;integrity attack;operation technology;information technology;deep learning;neural network","Integrated circuit modeling;Deep learning;Critical infrastructure;Security;Industrial control;Internet of Things","decision trees;industrial control;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;security of data","AdaBoost;DNN;random forest;imbalanced nature;information technology systems;IDS;intrusion detection systems;industrial control systems;Internet of Things;communication networks;cyber-attack Detection;decision tree classifiers;deep neural network;ICS environment;ensemble deep learning;imbalanced datasets;balanced representations","","7","","45","CCBY","4 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Aiming at the stealthy attacks suffered by industrial control systems, this paper processed an intrusion detection method oriented to industrial control process. The method focused on the change in the state of the controlled physical system, and under the premise that the alarm mechanism cannot detect the attack, it abstracted the intrusion detection into the optimization stopping of the detection of the state of the controlled system. Through adaptive optimization of the reference value in the non-parametric cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithm, the detection delay of the industrial control process is further shortened. Simulation experiments show that this method can detect the tampering of the sensor observation data by the attacker in time, and effectively avoid the physical damage of the controlled system.","","978-0-7381-2422-3","10.1109/DSA51864.2020.00028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9331220","industrial control system;intrusion detection;cumulative sum algorithm;stealthy attack","Intrusion detection;Process control;Control systems;Probability distribution;Temperature control;Integrated circuit modeling;Optimization","industrial control;security of data","intrusion detection method;industrial control system;stealthy attack;industrial field;industrial control process;controlled physical system;controlled system;detection delay","","","","13","","26 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, providing and ensuring adequate security for these ICS infrastructures are major concerns globally. The quick and accurate detection of any intrusive action into the ICS systems is highly important. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) have exhibited worrying forms of limitations and shortcomings due to the heterogeneity of different cyberattacks and intrusions. Thus, there are needs to devise effective security measures. This paper proposes an IDS model based on the hybridization of particle swarm optimization (PSO) with back-propagation neural network (BPNN) for classifying intrusions in water system infrastructure. The PSO is used to optimize the parameters for the BPNN, thus improving the efficiency of classification. For the validation of the proposed method, the iTrust Lab's secure water treatment dataset was used for experimentation. Using prominent classification metrics, the 97% accuracy and 98.7% precision results achieved using the developed BPNN-PSO model is better compared to other methods including models from related works. Thus, the proposed model can meet the requirements of cyberattacks and intrusions detection in practical water distribution infrastructure.","2153-0033","978-1-6654-1984-0","10.1109/AFRICON51333.2021.9570951","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9570951","Classification;critical infrastructures;industrial control systems;back-propagation neural network;particle swarm optimization;secure water treatment;water distribution systems","Integrated circuits;Neural networks;Intrusion detection;Resists;Tools;Water pollution;Security","","","","","","33","","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

What drives organizations to seek better methods to protect data? The cost of losing data can be high, and it will get higher. Large organizations are able to withstand the malware onslaught, small and mid-size companies have 50-50 chance of remaining in business. To reduce the damage caused by malware, organizations are investing in technology and research. Current research in supervised machine learning is promising. Small and mid-sized companies do not have security professionals to maintain and monitor them. Another area of research is “Honeypots” and “Red Flags”. These techniques may work in espionage, but “white hat testers” demonstrate that these traps are recognized and avoided. Organizations guilty of a data breach, even with clear evidence of negligence are seldom prosecuted. It is very rare that civil or criminal charges are brought against those negligent of reasonable efforts. Can the current environment change? New technologies will eventually be available for small and mid-sized organizations. Laws are changing to make senior management culpable for negligence in protecting sensitive data. Organizations need another way to protect against a data breach. An alternate, and easier strategy for fighting malware is to write software more difficult to hack. This research is identifying how current software practices, lessons learned from malware software, and a novel method to identify critical code, can reduce successful malware attacks. The objective of the research is to search for and identify critical sections in code that should be modified for reducing vulnerabilities. The critical application logic is identified and alternate designs are implemented making it more difficult for the malware author to locate and modify. This research examines easy processes to learn and apply. The work is applicable for all organization, but the existing focus is on helping small and mid-sized organizations. A goal is to reduce the complexity in designing more secure software. The primary considerations are that there are only small additional burdens on software designers and that management sees business value for supporting and requiring more secure software. Because small and mid-sized organizations are more tightly integrated into the supply chain, it the in the interest of large organization, government agencies and the public that these small and mid-sized organizations create more secure software. With an increasing shortage of cyber security professionals, the short-term alternative is to better train software developers for designing more secure software.","","978-1-5386-3443-1","10.1109/THS.2018.8574188","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8574188","malware defense, threat modeling, cyber security;secure coding","Malware;Organizations;Machine learning;Law","invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);small-to-medium enterprises","mid-sized organizations;malware attacks;software developers;critical application logic;small-sized organizations;Honeypots;Red Flags;malware software;sensitive data;data breach;supervised machine learning;cyber security professionals;software designers;secure software","","","","20","","13 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, blockchain technology has been widely used in the vehicular network to enhance trust, provenance, and eliminate unauthorized access to the vehicular services. However, most of the existing vehicular blockchain suffers from issues related to scalability, efficiency, and transaction verification. In this paper, we propose a lightweight vehicular blockchain architecture for distributed model sharing to enhance trust, verifiability, and non-repudiation in distributed vehicular collaboration. We propose a novel PoVS-BFT protocol and an effective two-step transaction verification mechanism for model sharing applications. Finally, simulation results are presented to conform to the efficacy of our proposed architecture. Simulation results show that the proposed PoVS-BFT protocol can minimize the size of consensus committee up to 62.5% which in turn reduces communication complexity during the consensus process.","2687-8860","978-1-7281-8294-0","10.1109/ISC251055.2020.9239055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9239055","Blockchain;Model Sharing;PoVS-BFT;VANET;Smart City;Consensus;Vehicular Edge","Adaptation models;Protocols;Simulation;Scalability;Collaboration;Blockchain;Complexity theory","communication complexity;cryptographic protocols;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","vehicular network;decentralized collaboration;forged message injection;forged identity;blockchain technology;unauthorized access;vehicular services;vehicular blockchain;lightweight vehicular blockchain architecture;distributed model;distributed vehicular collaboration;two-step transaction verification mechanism;model sharing applications;light-weight blockchain architecture;V2V Knowledge Sharing;autonomous vehicles;machine learning models;pedestrian detection;station prediction;path prediction;intrusion detection;PoVS-BFT protocol;communication complexity;consensus process","","2","","36","","29 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, they also raise major security concerns due to the inherent security vulnerabilities of built-in communication protocols. By exploiting these flaws, an adversary can attack sensors or actuators in an LPW network and force them to execute energy-hungry tasks such as verifying unauthenticated garbage messages repeatedly. This attack, namely energy depletion attack (EDA), can drain the batteries of the devices rapidly and lead to soaring network-wide energy expenditure. Consequently, the offense can leave the victims disabled, and even shut down the whole network due to the battery exhaustion of all the devices. In this paper, we investigate existing studies and provide a systematic review of EDAs and defenses in LPW networks. Through this work, we conclude that most existing LPW technologies are vulnerable to EDAs. This paper also indicates the security challenges in LPW networks related to EDAs along with the potential research directions.

We then combine different features with an evolutionary algorithm, in which way we evolve malware for variants. Previous results have shown that the existing AMTs only exhibit detection rate of 20%-30% for 10 000 evolved malware variants. In this paper, based on the modularized attack features, we apply the dynamic code generation and loading techniques to produce malware, so that we can audit the AMTs at runtime. We implement our approach, named Mystique-S, as a service-oriented malware generation system. Mystique-S automatically selects attack features under various user scenarios and delivers the corresponding malicious payloads at runtime. Relying on dynamic code binding (via service) and loading (via reflection) techniques, Mystique-S enables dynamic execution of payloads on user devices at runtime.

Unbalanced detectors can either lead to a high demand rate on the maintenance team (biased to false positives) or let failures happen with no preventive action (biased to false negatives), causing stoppages and accidents. In the context of railway operations, the use of sensors and their maintenance history generates rich data sources that can be explored to detect, identify, predict and treat faults before a possible incident. Machine Learning has been applied to this fault management context, in which supervised and semi-supervised models are extensively used to discriminate faulty observations. Supervised and semi-supervised models are effective for wellknown cases, but they are limited in novel cases, since faults can happen in unpredictable ways. Thus, unsupervised models are an alternative approach to deal with this limitation. This paper aims to evaluate the metrics and effectiveness of two unsupervised anomaly detection models - Isolation Forest and Autoencoders - to detect faults on rail cars. These models were applied to real measurements obtained from thermal, acoustic and impact sensors installed in a heavy haul railway line in Brazil. The results were compared to maintenance rules that guide general decisions for field inspections from railway operators. As main outcomes, Autoencoders produced balanced results in different scenarios, showing that these models can autonomously detect faults with great robustness. Therefore, they can compose predictive methods, improving the efficiency of maintenance tasks and railway operations.","","978-1-7281-4550-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2019.00172","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8999291","anomaly detection, fault detection, isolation forest, autoencoder, machine learning","Maintenance engineering;Fault detection;Anomaly detection;Machine learning;Sensors;Rail transportation;Data models","data analysis;fault diagnosis;feature extraction;inspection;maintenance engineering;neural nets;railway engineering;railway safety;railways;sensor fusion;supervised learning;unsupervised learning","supervised models;Brazil;impact sensors;acoustic sensors;thermal sensors;rail car fault detection;autoencoders;isolation forest;machine learning;heavy haul railway line operations;maintenance operations;unsupervised anomaly detection models;semisupervised models;fault management","","","","38","","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Alert reduction has been achieved with different techniques in related fields like intrusion detection. Furthermore, deep learning has been used to accomplish this task in other fields. In our paper, a set of deep neural networks have been tested to measure their ability to detect false positives, by processing alerts triggered by a fraud detection system.

Recently, a number of next-generation cross-layer attacks have been unveiled, which leverage small changes on one network layer to stealthily and significantly compromise another target layer. Since cross-layer attacks are stealthy, dynamic, and unpredictable in nature, novel security techniques are needed. Since models of the environment and attacker's behavior may be hard to obtain in practical scenarios, machine learning techniques become the ideal choice to tackle cross-layer attacks. In this paper, we propose FORMAT, a novel framework to tackle cross-layer security attacks in wireless networks. FORMAT is based on Bayesian learning and made up by a detection and a mitigation component. On one hand, the attack detection component constructs a model of observed evidence to identify stealthy attack activities. On the other hand, the mitigation component uses optimization theory to achieve the desired trade-off between security and performance. The proposed FORMAT framework has been extensively evaluated and compared with existing work by simulations and experiments obtained with a real-world testbed made up by Ettus Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) radios. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology as FORMAT is able to effectively detect and mitigate the considered cross-layer attacks.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2018.2864155","Air Force Research Laboratory(grant numbers:FA8750-15-3-6001-NU); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1618727); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8428428","Security;wireless;cross-layer;Bayesian;machine learning;USRP;software-defined radio","Jamming;Bayes methods;Security;Wireless networks;Mobile computing;Machine learning","Bayes methods;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;radio networks;software radio;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security","next-generation cross-layer attacks;network layer;cross-layer security attacks;wireless networks;stealthy attack activities;Bayesian learning approach;attack detection component;security threats;security techniques;machine learning techniques;mitigation component;optimization theory;FORMAT framework;real-world testbed;Ettus universal software radio peripheral radios","","2","","42","IEEE","7 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To increase the efficacy and stealthiness of such threats, a number of extremely challenging, next-generation cross-layer attacks have been recently unveiled. Although existing research has thoroughly addressed many single-layer attacks, the problem of detecting and mitigating cross-layer attacks still remains unsolved. For this reason, in this paper we propose a novel framework to analyze and address cross-layer attacks in wireless networks. Specifically, our framework consists of a detection and a mitigation component. The attack detection component is based on a Bayesian learning detection scheme that constructs a model of observed evidence to identify stealthy attack activities. The mitigation component comprises a scheme that achieves the desired trade-off between security and performance. We specialize and evaluate the proposed framework by considering a specific cross-layer attack that uses jamming as an auxiliary tool to achieve route manipulation.

Current efficient privacy-preserving data mining algorithms are based on an assumption that it is acceptable to release all the intermediate results during the data mining operations. However, it has been shown that such intermediate results can still leak private information. In this work, we use differential privacy to quantitatively limit such information leak. Differential privacy is a newly emerged privacy definition that is capable of providing strong measurable privacy guarantees. We propose Secure group Differential private Query (SDQ), a new algorithm that combines techniques from differential privacy and secure multiparty computation. Using decision tree induction as a case study, we show that SDQ can achieve stronger privacy than current efficient secure multiparty computation approach, and better accuracy than current differential privacy approach while maintaining efficiency.","1938-1883","978-1-61284-233-2","10.1109/icc.2011.5962863","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5962863","","Data privacy;Privacy;Noise;Distributed databases;Decision trees","data mining;data privacy;decision trees;groupware;Internet;law;storage management","distributed data mining;data communication;data storage technology;Internet;knowledge discovery;legal reasons;competitive reasons;private information;secure group differential private query;secure multiparty computation;decision tree","","20","26","21","","28 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Physical co-residency with other tenants poses a particular risk, due to pervasive virtualization in the cloud. Recent research has shown how side channels in shared hardware may enable attackers to exfiltrate sensitive data across virtual machines (VMs). In view of such risks, cloud providers may promise physically isolated resources to select tenants, but a challenge remains: Tenants still need to be able to verify physical isolation of their VMs. We introduce Home Alone, a system that lets a tenant verify its VMs' exclusive use of a physical machine. The key idea in Home Alone is to invert the usual application of side channels. Rather than exploiting a side channel as a vector of attack, Home Alone uses a side-channel (in the L2 memory cache) as a novel, defensive detection tool. By analyzing cache usage during periods in which ""friendly"" VMs coordinate to avoid portions of the cache, a tenant using Home Alone can detect the activity of a co-resident ""foe"" VM. Key technical contributions of Home Alone include classification techniques to analyze cache usage and guest operating system kernel modifications that minimize the performance impact of friendly VMs sidestepping monitored cache portions. Home Alone requires no modification of existing hyper visors and no special action or cooperation by the cloud provider.","2375-1207","978-0-7695-4402-1","10.1109/SP.2011.31","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5958037","Cloud computing;Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS);co-residency detection;side-channel analysis","Cloud computing;Timing;Virtual machine monitors;Probes;Hardware;Monitoring;Virtual machining","cache storage;cloud computing;formal verification;operating system kernels;security of data;ubiquitous computing;virtual machines;virtualisation","HomeAlone;co-residency detection;cloud computing;side-channel analysis;physical co-residency;pervasive virtualization;virtual machines;L2 memory cache;defensive detection tool;cache usage;co-resident foe VM activity detection;guest operating system kernel modifications","","170","4","49","","18 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Meanwhile, the static address configuration of networks and hosts simplifies adversarial reconnaissance for target discovery. Although the randomization of host addresses has been suggested as a proactive disruption mechanism against such reconnaissance, the proposed approaches do not exploit the full potentials of address randomization in provision of unpredictability and attack adaptability. Moreover, these approaches do not provide thorough analysis on effectiveness and limitations of address randomization against relevant threat models, including stealthy scanning and worms. In this paper, we present an effective address randomization technique, called random host address mutation (RHM), that turns end-hosts into untraceable moving targets. This technique achieves maximum efficacy by allowing address randomization to be highly unpredictable and fast, and adaptive to adversarial behavior, while incurring low operational and reconfiguration overhead. Our approach achieves the following objectives: (1) it achieves high uncertainty in adversary scanning by modeling address mutation randomization as a multi-level satisfiability problem; (2) it adapts the mutation scheme by fast characterization of adversarial reconnaissance patterns; (3) it achieves high mutation rate by separating mutation from end-hosts and managing it via network appliances; and (4) it preserves network integrity, manageability and performance by bounding the size of routing tables, preserving end-to-end reachability, and efficient handling of reconfiguration updates. Our extensive analyses and simulation show that the RHM distorts adversarial reconnaissance, slows down (deters) the attack, and increases its detectability. Consequently, the RHM is effective in countering a significant number of sophisticated threat models, including reconnaissance, stealthy/evasive scanning methods, and targeted attacks. We also address limitations of our approach in terms of effectiveness and applicability.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2467358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7185417","IP address randomization;Moving Target Defense (MTD);reconnaissance;scanning;IP address randomization;moving target defense (MTD);reconnaissance;scanning","IP networks;Reconnaissance;Routing;Entropy;Analytical models;Grippers;Nickel","computer network management;computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;IP networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","reconnaissance attack disruption;network reconnaissance;cyber attacks;static address configuration;target discovery;proactive disruption mechanism;unpredictability;attack adaptability;address randomization;threat models;random host address mutation;RHM;end-hosts;untraceable moving targets;adversarial behavior;operational overhead;reconfiguration overhead;adversary scanning;multilevel satisfiability problem;adversarial reconnaissance patterns;mutation rate;network appliances;network integrity;network manageability;network performance;routing tables;end-to-end reachability;reconfiguration updates;adversarial reconnaissance;threat models;stealthy scanning method;targeted attacks;evasive scanning method","","59","","34","IEEE","11 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although simple tasks can be automated or scripted, complex decision processes-increasingly needed to counter cyber threats-require SME insight and manual execution. As a result, cyber-defense operations tend to emphasize collection and archiving of data over real-time decision making and response, postponing actionable analysis and response until later, where “later” is frequently “too late.” In contrast, adversaries are readily using automation tools to minimize manual work and encapsulate autonomous behaviors into botnets and viruses that adapt to changing conditions. This imbalance puts the adversary in a position of advantage, a situation the research presented in this paper aims to remedy. The scarcity of cyber SMEs and the high cost of involving them in manual cyber responses are among the main factors contributing to the imbalance. The approach we describe aims to reduce the reliance on human SMEs, drive down the cost, and increase the effectiveness of CPTs by capturing expert knowledge in a tool that will automate the identification of known and unknown threats and the launching of mitigations to counter ongoing attacks at system speeds.","2155-7586","978-1-5090-3781-0","10.1109/MILCOM.2016.7795152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795152","Cyber defense operations;workflow learning;Cyber Protection Teams","Manuals;Sensors;US Department of Defense;Computer security;Actuators;Automation","computer viruses;decision making;invasive software","autonomous resiliency toolkit;next generation cyber defense platforms;cyber SMEs;botnets;real-time decision making;complex decision process;CPTs;cyber protection teams;subject matter experts","","2","","30","","26 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The returned results show that DAGMM gains the lowest false-positive rate and a relatively high detection rate on one of the data set, whereas SOM achieves the best results on the other data set. By comparing the detection rates of all algorithms on attacks that have no instance in the training set, and we find that K-Means works the better than the other three. Whereas the comparison on the attacks that have few instances in the training set shows that the ALAD works much better than the others since it uses the adversarial sample generation mechanism. We conclude that to achieve the best performance, integration of the traditional and deep-learning algorithms for network flow-based intrusion detection is critical.","","978-1-7281-7022-0","10.1109/BigDataService49289.2020.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9179547","Unsupervised Learning, Intrusion Detection, Network Flow, Deep Learning","Anomaly detection;Clustering algorithms;Self-organizing feature maps;Neurons;Unsupervised learning;Machine learning;Mathematical model","Gaussian processes;pattern clustering;security of data;self-organising feature maps;unsupervised learning","deep learning;unsupervised learning algorithms;K-means;SOM;DAGMM;ALAD;network flow-based anomaly detection;neural network settings;training set;adversarial sample generation mechanism;network flow-based intrusion detection;deep autoencoding Gaussian mixture model;adversarially learned anomaly detection","","","","14","","28 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sion",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,"2014 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy","20 Nov 2014","2014","","","605","620","An essential goal of Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) is assuring security policy enforcement and overall functionality in the presence of an untrustworthy OS. A fundamental obstacle to this goal is the difficulty in accurately extracting semantic meaning from the hypervisor's hardware level view of a guest OS, called the semantic gap. Over the twelve years since the semantic gap was identified, immense progress has been made in developing powerful VMI tools. Unfortunately, much of this progress has been made at the cost of reintroducing trust into the guest OS, often in direct contradiction to the underlying threat model motivating the introspection. Although this choice is reasonable in some contexts and has facilitated progress, the ultimate goal of reducing the trusted computing base of software systems is best served by a fresh look at the VMI design space. This paper organizes previous work based on the essential design considerations when building a VMI system, and then explains how these design choices dictate the trust model and security properties of the overall system. The paper then observes portions of the VMI design space which have been under-explored, as well as potential adaptations of existing techniques to bridge the semantic gap without trusting the guest OS. Overall, this paper aims to create an essential checkpoint in the broader quest for meaningful trust in virtualized environments through VM introspection.","2375-1207","978-1-4799-4686-0","10.1109/SP.2014.45","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6956590","VM Introspection;semantic gap;trust","Kernel;Data structures;Semantics;Virtual machine monitors;Monitoring;Linux;Security","information retrieval;security of data;trusted computing;virtual machines;virtualisation","virtual machine introspection;VMI system;semantic gap;trusted computing base;system security;virtualized environments;semantic meaning extraction","","60","3","94","","20 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the models face security challenges when an attacker has obtained their full details. In this paper, we propose a universal adversarial sample generator (U-ASG), to perform white-box adversarial attacks on autoencoder-based semi-supervised network anomaly detection (SSNAD) systems. The purpose of adversarial attacks is to generate small adversarial perturbations and add them to targeted anomalous samples to fly under the radar. We model the generation process of adversarial perturbations as an optimization problem, in which we minimize the reconstruction errors of the adversarial samples through the trained autoencoder and approximate it to solve. Furthermore, to improve the attack performance against the variational autoencoder (VAE), which is robust to tiny perturbations through uncertainty modeling, we design a mechanism to weaken its robustness by introducing a variance regularizer to the optimization. Simulation results show that the adversarial attacks generated by our U-ASG can effectively degrade the performance of the autoencoder-based SSNAD systems.","","978-1-7281-8695-5","10.1109/INFOCOMWKSHPS50562.2020.9162699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9162699","anomaly detection;autoencoder;adversarial perturbation;neural network","Perturbation methods;Anomaly detection;Optimization;Neural networks;Decoding;Data models;Principal component analysis","neural nets;security of data;supervised learning","U-ASG;adversarial attack;semisupervised machine learning models;deep neural networks;universal adversarial sample generator;white-box adversarial attacks;autoencoder-based semisupervised network anomaly detection systems;adversarial perturbations;generation process;trained autoencoder;attack performance;variational autoencoder;uncertainty modeling;autoencoder-based SSNAD systems","","","","19","","10 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accurate classification of the network traffic is the footstone of basic network services, say QoE, bandwidth allocation, and Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Previous classification methods have many shortcomings since they cannot deal with the encrypted network traffic but require human experts to select tons of features to attain a relatively decent accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we present a Deep Learning based end-to-end network traffic classification framework, termed TEST, to avoid the aforementioned problems. CNN and LSTM are combined and implemented to help the network intrusion detection systems automatically extract features from both special and time-related features of the raw traffic. The structure of our framework has two layers, which made it possible to attain a remarkable accuracy on encrypted traffic classification tasks.

Unfortunately, the recent emergence of attacks performed at the application layer has multiplied the number of possibilities that a botnet can exploit to conceal its malicious activities. New challenges arise, which cannot be addressed by simply borrowing the tools that have been successfully applied so far to earlier DDoS paradigms. In this paper, we offer basically three contributions: 1) we introduce an abstract model for the aforementioned class of attacks, where the botnet emulates normal traffic by continually learning admissible patterns from the environment; 2) we devise an inference algorithm that is shown to provide a consistent (i.e., converging to the true solution as time elapses) estimate of the botnet possibly hidden in the network; and 3) we verify the validity of the proposed inferential strategy on a test-bed environment. Our tests show that, for several scenarios of implementation, the proposed botnet identification algorithm needs an observation time in the order of (or even less than) 1 min to identify correctly almost all bots, without affecting the normal users' activity.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2017.2692685","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7895209","Distributed denial-of-service;DDoS;cyber-security;signal processing for network security","Computer crime;Dictionaries;Signal processing algorithms;Emulation;Technological innovation;Measurement","computer network security;inference mechanisms","DDoS attacks;randomized traffic innovation;distributed denial-of-service attacks;abstract model;inference algorithm;botnet identification algorithm","","23","","29","IEEE","12 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present a novel framework for the detection of anomalies, which, in particular, supports intrusion detection. The anomaly-detection framework we propose combines reinforcement learning with class-imbalance techniques. Our goal is not only to exploit the auto-learning ability of the reinforcement-learning loop but also to address the dataset imbalance problem, which is pervasive in existing learning-based solutions. We introduce an adapted SMOTE to address the class-imbalance problem while remodelling the behaviors of the environment agent for better performance. Experiments are conducted on NSL-KDD datasets. Comparative evaluations and their results are presented and analyzed. Using techniques such as SMOTE, ROS, NearMiss1 and NearMiss2, performance measures obtained from our simulations have led us to recognize specific performance trends.

Traditional machine learning solutions assume the existence of (cloud-based) central entities that are in charge of processing the data. Nonetheless, the difficulty of accessing private data, together with the high cost of transmitting raw data to the central entity gave rise to a decentralized machine learning approach called Federated Learning. The main idea of federated learning is to perform an on-device collaborative training of a single machine learning model without having to share the raw training data with any third-party entity. Although few survey articles on federated learning already exist in the literature, the motivation of this survey stems from three essential observations. The first one is the lack of a fine-grained multi-level classification of the federated learning literature, where the existing surveys base their classification on only one criterion or aspect. The second observation is that the existing surveys focus only on some common challenges, but disregard other essential aspects such as reliable client selection, resource management and training service pricing. The third observation is the lack of explicit and straightforward directives for researchers to help them design future federated learning solutions that overcome the state-of-the-art research gaps. To address these points, we first provide a comprehensive tutorial on federated learning and its associated concepts, technologies and learning approaches. We then survey and highlight the applications and future directions of federated learning in the domain of communication and networking. Thereafter, we design a three-level classification scheme that first categorizes the federated learning literature based on the high-level challenge that they tackle. Then, we classify each high-level challenge into a set of specific low-level challenges to foster a better understanding of the topic. Finally, we provide, within each low-level challenge, a fine-grained classification based on the technique used to address this particular challenge. For each category of high-level challenges, we provide a set of desirable criteria and future research directions that are aimed to help the research community design innovative and efficient future solutions. To the best of our knowledge, our survey is the most comprehensive in terms of challenges and techniques it covers and the most fine-grained in terms of the multi-level classification scheme it presents.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2021.3058573","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(grant numbers:RGPIN-2020-04707); Université du Québec en Outaouais (UQO); Lebanese American University; Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research (KUSTAR); European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program(grant numbers:101016509 (Project CHARITY)); Academy of Finland 6Genesis Project(grant numbers:318927); Academy of Finland CSN Project(grant numbers:311654); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9352033","Federated learning;federated learning tutorial;multi-level classification;statistical challenges;transfer learning;machine learning;security;communication and networking systems","Collaborative work;Machine learning;Tutorials;Training;Servers;Data models;Cloud computing","decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","federated machine learning;central entity;decentralized machine learning;fine-grained multilevel classification;high-level challenge;multilevel classification scheme;decision making","","5","","183","IEEE","10 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Attacks on critical information systems and infrastructure are not solely network, or malware, or single disks; they are coordinated, large-scale multisite attacks done in an organized manner. With the increase in frequency and sophistication of these attacks, it is not enough to rely on intrusion detection systems, trusted IT staff, or organizational information security divisions. The velocity of a cyber attack should be met with an equally coordinated response. There is a need to develop a platform that enables responders to establish trust and develop an effective collaborative response plan and investigation process across multiple organizations and legal bodies to track adversaries, mitigate the threat, get critical systems back online, and pursue legal action against the offenders. In this work we propose such a platform for efficient collaboration. Our work is informed by our practices in supporting law enforcement organizations dealing with large-scale distributed attacks on critical information systems and infrastructure and by an examination of Stuxnet, a computer worm discovered in June 2010 that is believed to have been created by the United States and Israel to attack Iran's nuclear facilities. Based on these experiences of operational support, the authors propose Cerebro, an Extensible Large-Scale Analysis Platform designed to fuse structured domain specific information, decision support, and collaboration in an automated fashion, to effectively detect and respond to such attacks.","","978-1-4799-1535-4","10.1109/THS.2013.6699007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6699007","network security;incident response;digital intelligence;digital investigations;multi-site coordination;multi-site collaboration","Collaboration;Organizations;Computers;Law enforcement;Monitoring;Malware","invasive software","Cerebro platform;collaborative incident response;critical information systems;malware;multisite attacks;intrusion detection systems;trusted IT staff;organizational information security divisions;information technology;cyber attack velocity;collaborative investigation process;Stuxnet computer worm;large-scale distributed attacks;extensible large-scale analysis platform","","4","","10","","2 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An attacker can use a generator, here a Generative Adversarial Network, to alter an attack so that the IDS model misclassify it as normal network traffic. There is a race between adversarial attacks and mechanisms to make robust IDSs, like Adversarial Training. To our knowledge, no study thoroughly assesses how attack generators or IDS training is sensitive to parameters controlling resources spent during training. Such results provide insights on how much to spend on IDS training. This paper presents the outcome of this assessment for GANs vs adversarial training. Interestingly, it shows that GANs’ evasion capabilities are either very good or poor, with almost no average cases.

For example, an attacker can physically re-point a surveillance camera, can move a smart device to another location, can send a sound signal to influence an accelerometer, can cause wireless jamming, etc. We propose to create ""smart buttons,"" and collections of them called ""smart blankets"" as hardware/software (HW/SW) security patches rather than software-only patches.

In many such applications, the graph data is actually distributed across several organizations where each owns a portion of the overall graph. Due to privacy concerns, the parties may not wish to disclose their local graphs. However, the computation of maximum-flow over the overall graph brings great benefits to concerned stakeholders. In this paper, we address the privacy preserving maximum-flow computation problem in distributed graphs. We propose a two-stage approach that achieves privacy protection while ensuring the correct maximum flow computation. In the first stage, a novel probabilistic edge expansion process is used to obfuscate the graph structure and prevent node re-identification while preserving the maximum flow, the second stage securely integrates local graphs into a global whole such that any third party can then compute the maximum flow. We provide a thorough correctness and privacy analysis and experimentally evaluate the proposed approach.","","978-1-4673-5638-1","10.1109/SocialCom-PASSAT.2012.20","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406294","maximum flow;privacy","Privacy;Organizations;Logistics;Computational modeling;Data models;Distributed databases;Probabilistic logic","data privacy;graph theory;organisational aspects;probability","privacy preserving maximum-flow computation;distributed graph data modelling;organizations;local graphs;stakeholders;two-stage approach;privacy protection;probabilistic edge expansion process;graph structure obfuscation;node reidentification prevention;maximum flow preservation;global graphs","","1","","14","","10 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When framing cyber asset selection as a HLIF problem, one key aspect involves estimation of network-wide impacts generated by cyber assets. Cyberspace is a highly dynamic man-made domain with a high degree of uncertainty and incomplete data which must be transformed into knowledge to support precise and predictable cyber effects estimation. Current systems have to rely on human subject matter experts (SMEs) for most tasks, rendering the cyber asset planning process too time consuming and therefore operationally ineffective. This paper proposes an architecture that leverages probabilistic ontologies to expedite the cyber asset planning process, allowing for the automation of most time-consuming, error-prone, SME-based knowledge elicitation under uncertainty.

In particular, it exploits the self-augmented training mechanism using synthetically generated local perturbations. DRo not only allays the challenges with sparse-labeled data but also offers many unique advantages. We also developed a system named DRoID that uses the DRo mechanism for enhancing the performance of an existing Malware Detection System that uses (low information features like the) Android implicit Intent(s) as the only features. We conduct experiments on DRoID using a popular and standardized Android malware dataset and found that the DRo mechanism could successfully reduce the false-alarms generated by the downstream classifier by 67.9%, and also simultaneously boosts its accuracy by 11.3%. This is significant not only because the gains achieved are unparalleled but also because the features used were never considered rich-enough to train a classifier on; and hence no decent performance could ever be reported by any malware classification system till-date using these features in isolation. Owing to the results achieved, the DRo mechanism claims a dominant position amongst all known systems that aims to enhance the classification performance of deep learning models with sparse-labeled data.","0742-1303","978-1-6654-1886-7","10.1109/LCN52139.2021.9524929","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9524929","Self Augmented Training;Deep Clustering;Transfer Learning;Deep Routing;Malware Detection;Android Intent","Training;Deep learning;Perturbation methods;Performance gain;Feature extraction;Routing;Malware","","","","","","35","","7 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this technology introduces new vulnerabilities and opportunities for malicious users compared to traditional wireless networks due to its intrinsic characteristics.

Before the rise of machine learning, network anomalies which could imply an attack, were detected using well-crafted rules. An attacker who has knowledge in the field of cyber-defence, could make educated guesses to sometimes accurately predict which particular features of network traffic data the cyber-defence mechanism is looking at. With this information, the attacker can circumvent a rulebased cyber-defense system. However, after the advancements of machine learning for network anomaly, it is not easy for a human to understand how to bypass a cyber-defence system. Recently, adversarial attacks have become increasingly common to defeat machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we show that even if we build a classifier and train it with adversarial examples for network data, we can use adversarial attacks and successfully break the system. We propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based algorithm to generate data to train an efficient neural network based classifier, and we subsequently break the system using adversarial attacks.","","978-1-7281-6873-9","10.1109/BigDataSecurity-HPSC-IDS49724.2020.00020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9123023","adversarial attacks;network intrusion;GANs","","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;security of data","adversarial attacks;GAN based classifier;machine learning approaches;network anomalies;network traffic data;cyber-defence system;machine learning algorithms;network data;efficient neural network based classifier;NAttack;network intrusion detection;rule based cyber-defense system;generative adversarial network based algorithm","","5","","24","","23 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition to the conventional approach of human interactive proofs such as CAPTCHAs, a more recent approach of human observational proofs (HOP) has been developed to automatically distinguish web bots from human users. Its design rationale is that web bots behave intrinsically differently from human beings, allowing them to be detected. This paper escalates the battle against web bots by exploring the limits of current HOP-based bot detection systems. We develop an evasive web bot system based on human behavioral patterns. Then we prototype a general web bot framework and a set of flexible de-classifier plugins, primarily based on application-level event evasion. We further abstract and define a set of benchmarks for measuring our system's evasion performance on contemporary web applications, including social network sites. Our results show that the proposed evasive system can effectively mimic human behaviors and evade detectors by achieving high similarities between human users and evasive bots.","2158-3927","978-1-4673-6472-0","10.1109/DSN.2013.6575366","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6575366","Web security;bot;machine learning;human observation proofs","Servers","data mining;Internet;security of data;social networking (online)","crawlers;online task automation;Internet;human interactive proof approach;CAPTCHA;human observational proofs;HOP-based bot detection systems;evasive Web bot system;human behavioral patterns;general Web bot framework;flexible declassifier plugins;application-level event evasion;system evasion performance;Web applications;social network sites","","3","","25","","8 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, traditional network signature-based or IoC (Indicator of Compromise) detection could fail since the encryption and variability of threats has been increasing. It is well known that these methods are fragile and have difficulty dealing with new variants. This paper proposes a system designed to detect security threats based on the statistical characteristics of HTTP requests from malware. The corresponding method does not rely on signatures or the specific command and control (C&C) contents between bots and the botmaster and can be built given easily accessible information extracted from the HTTP data log, including HTTP headers and the URL. The results from millions of live traffic flows show correct detection with a precision exceeding 98.32% for malicious flows, and the recall reaches 98.70%. We believe this detector represents the main mechanism for discovering network threats in the future.","","978-1-5386-4210-8","10.1109/DSC.2018.00084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8411905","Malware Detection, Network Traffic, Machine Learning","Malware;Uniform resource locators;Feature extraction;Botnet;Law;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;invasive software;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","network traffic inspection;security devices;polymorphic techniques;zero-day attacks;IoC;encryption;security threats;statistical characteristics;HTTP requests;HTTP data;HTTP headers;network threats;detection malware requests;network signature-based detection;Indicator of Compromise detection","","1","","19","","19 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The considered attack scenario is manipulation of the advanced measuring infrastructures (AMIs) readings and/or smart inverters data. These manipulated data from the grid edge devices mislead the grid operator for making proper operational planning decisions. In a stealthy attack model, where the attacker compromises significant number of these smart devices, serious demand-supply unbalance can occur that may result in major blackouts. The proposed IDS is based on a condition monitoring vector (CMV) equipped with a learned ultra-short-term demand forecasting (USTDF) mechanism. This cybersecurity approach is able to verify smart devices readings. In the proposed method, the instantaneous difference of collected AMIs and other smart devices data with the ultra-short term forecasted demand is defined as the CMV. This vector probes a pre-defined error band for identifying the compromised smart devices. The learned USTDF mechanism is based on the distribution grid historical load profile and the temperature data for the goal area. An accurate multi-dimensional regression model is developed and learned for forecasting the load behavior in this area. Finally, the suspicious areas are flagged or become separated from the main grid by the network operator based on the proposed CMV outcomes and the output of decision-making module. The proposed IDS aims to enhance the cybersecurity of the smart devices at the grid-edge that plays major role in ensuring the resiliency of the grid. The theoretical analyses are verified by several case studies.","","978-1-7281-9591-9","10.1109/CyberPELS49534.2020.9311534","Qatar National Research Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9311534","intrusion detection system;smart meters;smart inverters;AMI;cybersecurity","Power system stability;Smart devices;Correlation;Time series analysis;Load modeling;Inverters;Intrusion detection","condition monitoring;decision making;invertors;load forecasting;power distribution planning;power distribution reliability;power engineering computing;regression analysis;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids;supply and demand","anomaly detection;distribution power system;condition monitoring vector;proactive intrusion detection system;IDS;smart distribution power systems;smart inverters data;grid edge devices;grid operator;stealthy attack model;CMV;learned ultra-short-term demand forecasting mechanism;distribution grid historical load profile;decision-making module;advanced measuring infrastructures;AMI;operational planning decisions;smart devices;demand-supply unbalance;blackouts;USTDF;cybersecurity approach;multidimensional regression model;load forecasting","","3","","20","","5 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To resolve above issues, this article proposes a network intrusion detection model called CWGAN-CSSAE, which combines improved conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (CWGAN) and cost-sensitive stacked autoencoders (CSSAE). First of all, the CWGAN network that introduces gradient penalty and L2 regularization is used to generate specified minority attack samples to reduce the class imbalance of the training dataset. Secondly, the stacked autoencoder is used to intelligently extract the deep abstract features of the network data. Finally, a cost-sensitive loss function is constructed to give a large misclassification cost to a minority of attack samples. Thus, effective detection of network intrusion attacks can be realized. The experimental results based on KDDTest<sup>+</sup>, KDDTest-21, and UNSW-NB15 datasets show that the CWGAN-CSSAE network intrusion detection model improves the detection accuracy of minority attacks and unknown attacks. In addition, the method in this article is compared with other existing intrusion detection methods, excellent results have been achieved in performance indicators such as accuracy and F1 score. The accuracy on the above datasets reached 90.34%, 80.78% and 93.27% respectively. The accuracy of U2R on the KDDTest<sup>+</sup> and KDDTest-21 datasets both reached 42.50%.

However an issue classification with supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled dataset, which takes costly human-labor and time to annotate raw performance metric data. To address this issue, we propose a method that employs Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE), which is a semi-supervised learning method.

Recent approaches to solving this problem use an unsupervised deep learning-based technique called Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Because GAN variants show great performance in image augmentation, some research tries to apply GANs to cyberspace by domain conversion from binary to image. However, the attribute of cyberspace benchmarks is different from that of images. In this paper, we propose using sequence-based generative models such as Sequence Generative Adversarial Nets (SeqGAN) and Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) to augment the ADFA-LD dataset, a sequence call based benchmark.

With possession of the private key, an attacker virtually owns all of the currency in the compromised wallet. Managing cryptocurrency wallets offline, in isolated (`air-gapped') computers, has been suggested in order to secure the private keys from theft. Such air-gapped wallets are often referred to as `cold wallets.' In this paper we show how private keys can be exfiltrated from air-gapped wallets. In the adversarial attack model, the attacker infiltrates the offline wallet, infecting it with malicious code. The malware can be preinstalled or pushed in during the initial installation of the wallet, or it can infect the system when removable media (e.g., USB flash drive) is inserted into the wallet's computer in order to sign a transaction. These attack vectors have repeatedly been proven feasible in the last decade (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]). Having obtained a foothold in the wallet, an attacker can utilize various air-gap covert channel techniques (bridgeware [11]) to jump the airgap and exfiltrate the wallet's private keys. We evaluate various exfiltration techniques, including physical, electromagnetic, electric, magnetic, acoustic, optical, and thermal techniques. This research shows that although cold wallets provide a high degree of isolation, it's not beyond the capability of motivated attackers to compromise such wallets and steal private keys from them. We demonstrate how a 256-bit private key (e.g., Bitcoin's private keys) can be exfiltrated from an offline, air-gapped wallet of a fictional character named Satoshi within a matter of seconds.","","978-1-5386-7975-3","10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00227","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8726762","","Bitcoin;Malware;Media;Hardware;Universal Serial Bus;Internet","air gaps;private key cryptography","air-gapped cryptocurrency wallets;attacker;compromised wallet;air-gapped wallets;cold wallets;adversarial attack model;offline wallet;air-gap covert channel techniques;Bitcoin's private keys;cryptocurrency wallets","","5","","75","","3 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, a human analyst can give feedback to few data when he/she examines the results of an unsupervised outlier detection method. Moreover, the widely used unsupervised method for outlier detection cannot only take the labeled data into consideration nor use them properly. In this study, we first propose a graph-based method to endow the unsupervised method with the ability to consider few labeled data. Then, we extend our semi-supervised method to active outlier detection by incorporating the query strategy that selects top-ranked outliers.

A cognitive transmitter uses a pre-trained classifier to predict the current channel status based on recent sensing results and decides whether to transmit or not, whereas a jammer collects channel status and ACKs to build a deep learning classifier that reliably predicts the next successful transmissions and effectively jams them. This jamming approach is shown to reduce the transmitter's performance much more severely compared with random or sensing-based jamming. The deep learning classification scores are used by the jammer for power control subject to an average power constraint. Next, a generative adversarial network is developed for the jammer to reduce the time to collect the training dataset by augmenting it with synthetic samples. As a defense scheme, the transmitter deliberately takes a small number of wrong actions in spectrum access (in form of a causative attack against the jammer) and therefore prevents the jammer from building a reliable classifier. The transmitter systematically selects when to take wrong actions and adapts the level of defense to mislead the jammer into making prediction errors and consequently increase its throughput.","2332-7731","","10.1109/TCCN.2018.2884910","Army Research Laboratory(grant numbers:W911NF-17-C-0090); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8558114","Cognitive radio;jammer;adversarial machine learning;deep learning;generative adversarial network;power control","Jamming;Sensors;Radio transmitters;Wireless communication;Deep learning;Receivers","cognitive radio;jamming;learning (artificial intelligence);radio networks","deep learning classifier;jamming approach;deep learning classification scores;power control subject;average power constraint;generative adversarial network;causative attack;adversarial machine;wireless communications;defense strategy;cognitive transmitter;pre-trained classifier;wireless jamming attacks","","47","","41","IEEE","4 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An additional feature of the obfuscated supervisor, if it exists, is that it has exactly the minimum number of states among the set of all the resilient and behavior-preserving supervisors. Our approach involves a simple combination of two basic ideas: 1) a formulation of the problem of computing behavior-preserving supervisors as the problem of computing separating finite state automata under controllability and observability constraints, which can be tackled by using SAT solvers, and 2) the use of a recently proposed technique for the verification of attackability in our setting, with a normality assumption imposed on both the actuator attackers and supervisors.","","978-3-907144-00-8","10.23919/ECC.2019.8795844","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8795844","cyber-physical systems;discrete-event systems;actuator attack;supervisory control","","closed loop systems;computability;finite state machines;security of data","actuator attackers;supervisor obfuscation;actuator enablement attack;actuator attacker;obfuscated supervisor;behavior-preserving supervisors;closed-loop system;normality assumption;attackability;finite state automata;SAT solvers","","5","","25","","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) provide abstract information on attacker behavior, but are only available in human-readable format that prevents automatic detection using IDSs. In this paper we therefore propose an approach that extracts cyber threat intelligence from raw log data and combines the advantages of IoCs and TTPs by producing detectable patterns of complex system behavior. Other than existing approaches, our approach employs log data anomaly detection to disclose suspicious log events, which are used for iterative clustering, pattern recognition, and refinement.

Analysis has been carried out for studying the reasons of DNNs' vulnerability to adversarial perturbation and focused on model architecture. No research has been done on investigating the impact of optimization algorithms (namely, optimizers in DNNs) employed in training DNN models on models' sensitivity to adversarial examples. This paper aims to study this impact from an experimental perspective. We analyze the sensitivity of a model not only from the aspect of white-box and black-box attack setups, but also from the aspect of different types of datasets. Four common optimizers, SGD, RMSprop, Adadelta, and Adam, are investigated on structured and unstructured datasets. Extensive experiment results indicate that an optimization algorithm does pose effects on the DNN model sensitivity to adversarial examples. That is, when training models and generating adversarial examples, Adam optimizer can generate better quality adversarial examples for structured datasets, and Adadelta optimizer can generate better quality adversarial examples for unstructured datasets. In addition, the choice of optimizers does not affect the transferability of adversarial examples.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948658","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672092); Northwestern Polytechnical University(grant numbers:2018JBZ103); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8878095","Adversarial examples;deep neural network;machine learning;stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithm;transferability","Optimization;Sensitivity;Neural networks;Training;Jacobian matrices;Machine learning;Perturbation methods","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation","Adam optimizer;optimizer impact;DNN model sensitivity;adversarial perturbation;model architecture;optimization algorithm;DNN model training;white-box attack;black-box attack setups;training models;DNN vulnerability;adadelta optimizer","","5","","41","CCBY","21 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, many events are associated with software that is unrecognized by inspection services. As a result, it is impossible to manually investigate and react to all of them. Traditional quantitative analysis is nearly useless because benign anomalies and attacks are indiscernible. We developed a system that continuously and automatically processes streaming data to help identify suspicious activity. The data comprises low-level traces of process activity. Each streamed activity is augmented with a signature that heuristically biases the degree of suspicion associated with the activity. The system then flags activities that are unknown to inspection services and likely to be malicious. It extracts behavioral and statistical information from the events, builds a predictive model based on supervised learning, and ranks the events suspected of being malicious. We tested the system using VirusTotal on three months of historical data. The results showed we were able to predict more than two thirds of the malicious events unknown at that time, with less than a 2% false positive rate.","0018-8646","","10.1147/JRD.2016.2559358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7523355","","Malware;Feature extraction;Computer security;Inspection;Databases;Predictive models","","","","3","","32","IBM","27 Jul 2016","","","IBM","IBM Journals"

Thus, it is important to detect such anomalies. Detecting such anomalies is challenging since it is uncertain when and where anomalies can happen. To this end, we present a novel approach called Anomaly deTection with digiTAl twIN (ATTAIN), which continuously and automatically builds a digital twin with live data obtained from a CPS for anomaly detection. ATTAIN builds a Timed Automaton Machine (TAM) as the digital representation of the CPS, and implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to detect anomalies. GAN uses a GCN-LSTM-based module as a generator, which can capture temporal and spatial characteristics of the input data and learn to produce realistic unlabeled adversarial samples. TAM labels these adversarial samples, which are then fed into a discriminator along with real labeled samples. After training, the discriminator is capable of distinguishing anomalous data from normal data with a high F1 score. To evaluate our approach, we used three publicly available datasets collected from three CPS testbeds. Evaluation results show that ATTAIN improved the performance of two state-of-art anomaly detection methods by 2.413%, 8.487%, and 5.438% on average on the three datasets, respectively. Moreover, ATTAIN achieved on average 8.39% increase in the anomaly detection capability with digital twins as compared with an approach of not using digital twins.","2159-4848","978-1-7281-6836-4","10.1109/ICST49551.2021.00031","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9438560","cyber-physical system;digital twin;machine learning;anomaly detection","Training;Software testing;Digital twin;Learning automata;Conferences;Digital representation;Generative adversarial networks","cyber-physical systems;data analysis;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets","ATTAIN;digital representation;cyber physical Systems;anomaly detection with digital twin;timed automaton machine;generative adversarial network;GCN LSTM based module;anomalous data;normal data","","","","38","","24 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
