Since communication networks are vulnerable to various kinds of cyber attacks it is important to detect them and prevent an important machinery like the power grid to get affected from cyber attacks. False data injection attacks (FDIA) are one of the most common attack strategies where an attacker tries to trick the underlying control system of the grid, by injecting false data in sensor measurements to cause disruptions. Our work has focused towards Least Effort attacks of two types i.e., Random and Target Attacks. Further, we propose a data augmented deep learning based solution to detect such attacks in real time. We aim at generating realistic attack simulations on standard IEEE 14 architectures and train neural networks to detect such attacks.","","978-1-7281-0407-2","10.1109/NAPS46351.2019.9000216","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9000216","False Data Injection;State Estimation;Random and Target attacks;Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)","Correlation;Anomaly detection;Deep learning;Neural networks;Transmission line measurements;Meters;Power systems","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;power engineering computing;power grids;power system security;power system state estimation;security of data","communication networks;cyber attacks;false data injection attacks;common attack strategies;Least Effort attacks;Target Attacks;realistic attack simulations;power system state estimation;electric power grid;modern power grid;control system;learning-based defense;FDIA;sensor measurements;data augmented deep learning based solution;standard IEEE 14 architectures;random attacks","","2","","20","","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, security remains as one of the paramount concern as many IoT devices are vulnerable. Moreover, IoT malware are constantly evolving and getting more sophisticated. IoT devices are intended to perform very specific tasks, so their networking behavior is expected to be reasonably stable and predictable. Any significant behavioral deviation from the normal patterns would indicate anomalous events. In this paper, we present a method to detect anomalous network communications in IoT networks using a set of sparse autoencoders. The proposed approach allows us to differentiate malicious communications from legitimate ones. So that, if a device is compromised only malicious communications can be dropped while the service provided by the device is not totally interrupted. To characterize network behavior, bidirectional TCP flows are extracted and described using statistics on the size of the first N packets sent and received, along with statistics on the corresponding inter-arrival times between packets. A set of sparse autoencoders is then trained to learn the profile of the legitimate communications generated by an experimental smart home network. Depending on the value of N, the developed model achieves attack detection rates ranging from 86.9% to 91.2%, and false positive rates ranging from 0.1% to 0.5%.","2643-7929","978-1-7281-2522-0","10.1109/NCA.2019.8935007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8935007","Machine Learning;Neural Network;Anomaly Detection;Internet of Things;Network Security","Feature extraction;Security;Neurons;Standards;Anomaly detection;Malware;Performance evaluation","computer network security;Internet of Things;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","experimental smart home network;anomalous communications detection;IoT networks;sparse autoencoders;IoT devices;smart services;IoT malware;networking behavior;significant behavioral deviation;anomalous events;anomalous network communications;differentiate malicious communications;network behavior;legitimate communications","","2","","22","","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The capabilities of IoT also enable its important role in homeland security and tactical missions, including Reconnaissance, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RISTA). IoT security becomes the most critical issue before its extensive use in military operations. While the majority of research focuses on smart IoT devices, treatments for legacy dumb network-ready devices are lacking; moreover, IoT devices deployed in a hostile environment are often required to be dumb due to the strict hardware constraints, making them highly vulnerable to cyber attacks. To mitigate the problem, we propose a light-weight authentication scheme for dumb IoT devices, in a case study of the UAV-sensor collaborative RISTA missions. Our scheme utilizes the covert channels in the physical layer for authentications and does not request conventional key deployments, key generations which may cause security risks and large overhead that a dumb sensor cannot afford. Our scheme operates on the physical layer, and thus it is highly portable and generalizable to most commercial and military communication protocols. We demonstrate the viability of our scheme by building a prototype system and conducting experiments to emulate the behaviors of UAVs and sensors in real scenarios.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761538","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761538","","Authentication;Physical layer;Internet of Things;Sensors;Data communication;Surveillance","autonomous aerial vehicles;computer network security;Internet of Things;military aircraft;military communication;protocols;surveillance","legacy dumb network-ready devices;strict hardware constraints;light-weight authentication scheme;dumb IoT devices;UAV-sensor collaborative RISTA missions;physical layer;commercial communication protocols;military communication protocols;communication technologies;homeland security;tactical missions;IoT security;military operations;smart IoT devices;air force internet of Things;reconnaissance-intelligence-surveillance-target acquisition","","1","","30","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We formulate a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model to determine an optimal attack sequence over a hybrid attack graph with cyber (discrete) and physical (continuous) components and related physical dynamics. We apply model-based and model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods to solve the discrete-continuous MDP in a tractable fashion.

In dealing with this security requirement, the research community focuses on developing new security mechanisms such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), facilitated by leveraging modern machine learning techniques. However, these algorithms require a testing platform and a considerable amount of data to be trained and tested accurately. To satisfy this prerequisite, Academia, Industry, and Government are increasingly proposing testbed (i.e., scaled-down versions of ICSs or simulations) to test the performances of the IDSs. Furthermore, to enable researchers to cross-validate security systems (e.g., security-by-design concepts or anomaly detectors), several datasets have been collected from testbeds and shared with the community. In this paper, we provide a deep and comprehensive overview of ICSs, presenting the architecture design, the employed devices, and the security protocols implemented.

Of the world's 1 million most visited websites, nearly half use a CMS, and WordPress alone claims 25% market share of all websites. While their easy-to-use templates and components have greatly simplified the work of developing high quality websites, it comes at the cost of software vulnerabilities that are inevitable in such large and rapidly evolving frameworks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are often used to protect Internet-facing applications, but conventional techniques struggle to keep up with the fast pace of development in today's web applications. Rapid changes to application interfaces increase the workload of maintaining an IDS whitelist, yet the broad attack surface of a web application makes for a similarly verbose blacklist. We developed ZenIDS to dynamically learn the trusted execution paths of an application during a short online training period and report execution anomalies as potential intrusions. We implement ZenIDS as a PHP extension supported by 8 hooks instrumented in the PHP interpreter.

However, employing a supervised machine learning technique to detect anomalies in large production scale industrial software systems is highly impractical due to the requirement of annotated data. This raises the need for comprehensive semi-supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection mechanisms. This paper presents the application of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based models to detect system anomalies using semi-supervised one-class learning. We show that the use of a variant of GAN known as bidirectional GAN (BiGAN) gives augmented results when compared to the traditional GAN based anomaly detection, for the selected industrial system. Moreover, the experiments clearly show that the performance of the BiGAN has a direct correlation with the dimensions of the dataset used for training. The BiGAN even tends to outperform the well-established semi-supervised One-class SVM classifier and a prominent generative network for semi-supervised anomaly detection, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) when the size of the feature space increases.","","978-1-7281-3632-5","10.1109/MERCon.2019.8818750","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8818750","anomaly detection;industrial software systems;generative adversarial network;variational autoencoders;GAN;BiGAN;VAE","Anomaly detection;Generative adversarial networks;Software systems;Hidden Markov models;Gallium nitride;Generators;Support vector machines","neural nets;production engineering computing;security of data;supervised learning;unsupervised learning","semisupervised one-class learning;unsupervised anomaly detection;supervised machine learning;generative adversarial networks;bidirectional GAN;production scale industrial software systems;semisupervised anomaly detection;BiGAN","","","","37","","29 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the favorable applications of DNNs, these systems can be exploited by adversarial examples. An adversarial example, which is created by adding a small amount of noise to an original sample, can cause misclassification by the DNN. Under specific circumstances, it may be necessary to create a selective untargeted adversarial example that will not be classified as certain avoided classes. Such is the case, for example, if a modified tank cover can cause misclassification by a DNN, but the bandit equipped with the DNN must misclassify the modified tank as a class other than certain avoided classes, such as a tank, armored vehicle, or self-propelled gun. That is, selective untargeted adversarial examples are needed that will not be perceived as certain classes, such as tanks, armored vehicles, or self-propelled guns. In this study, we propose a selective untargeted adversarial example that exhibits 100% attack success with minimum distortions. The proposed scheme creates a selective untargeted adversarial example that will not be classified as certain avoided classes while minimizing distortions in the original sample. To generate untargeted adversarial examples, a transformation is performed to minimize the probability of certain avoided classes and distortions in the original sample. As experimental datasets, we used MNIST and CIFAR-10, including the Tensorflow library. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme creates a selective untargeted adversarial example that exhibits 100% attack success with minimum distortions (1.325 and 34.762 for MNIST and CIFAR-10, respectively).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2920410","Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion(grant numbers:2016-0-00173); National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:2017R1A2B4006026); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8727886","Machine learning;adversarial example;deep neural network (DNN);avoided classes","Distortion;Neurons;Mathematical model;Biological neural networks;Machine learning;Target recognition","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;probability","selective untargeted evasion attack;selective untargeted adversarial example;untargeted adversarial examples;deep neural networks;certain avoided classes;Tensorflow library;CIFAR-10 datasets;MNIST datasets;probability;DNN;pattern recognition;pattern analysis;machine learning","","1","","31","OAPA","3 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, the heterogeneity of CPS components and the diversity of CPS systems have made it difficult to study the problem with one generalized model. In this paper, we study and systematize existing research on CPS security under a unified framework. The framework consists of three orthogonal coordinates: 1) from the security perspective, we follow the well-known taxonomy of threats, vulnerabilities, attacks and controls; 2) from the CPS components perspective, we focus on cyber, physical, and cyberphysical components; and 3) from the CPS systems perspective, we explore general CPS features as well as representative systems (e.g., smart grids, medical CPS, and smart cars). The model can be both abstract to show general interactions of components in a CPS application, and specific to capture any details when needed. By doing so, we aim to build a model that is abstract enough to be applicable to various heterogeneous CPS applications; and to gain a modular view of the tightly coupled CPS components. Such abstract decoupling makes it possible to gain a systematic understanding of CPS security, and to highlight the potential sources of attacks and ways of protection.

In addition to this, some insiders having administrative rights to access privileged information and perform operations on it might turn rogue. Their malicious actions could go undetected as their digital footprint might get buried in massive dumps of log data. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive explanation of the problem statement at hand, Insider Threat Detection using Deep Learning. It has been initiated by introducing Insider Threat Detection and related terminology. Deep Learning has been chosen as the preferred approach for solving this problem statement as it has been proven to be better than the conventional Machine Learning algorithms while dealing with complex data originating from varied sources. Here, Deep Learning and Log based Anomaly Detection have been explained. Some datasets available specifically for the research domain of Insider Threat Detection have been brought under one roof. Then, by having a closer look at the CERT Insider Threat Dataset, a brief comparative analysis of the existing Deep Learning solutions for Insider Threat Detection based on this dataset is provided.

Through the proposed taxonomy, foreseeable AI crimes are systematically studied and related forensic techniques are also addressed.

There are two problems in dealing with readable obfuscation: 1. Difficulty in locating it since it does not manipulate suspicious strings. 2. It is a common and essential practice adopted in both benign codes and malicious codes. In this work, we first investigate why and how readable obfuscation can hinder detection of maliciousness and prevent the static analysis of suspicious scripts. Next, we propose a readable JavaScript obfuscation detector (RedJsod) system to deal with this type of threat. RedJsod is a well defined detector based on variable length context-based feature extraction (VCLFE) scheme that takes advantages of abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of a given JavaScript code to infer run-time behaviors statically. We applied RedJsod to three datasets collected from real world Web-pages to evaluate its effectiveness. Also, we tested RedJsod on well-known readable obfuscation samples cited in related works as a proof of concept illustration.

An extra loss added in the objective function enforces the discriminative encoder to use the mean value of the output vector for discrimination, which also empowers it with encoding ability. In the testing process, the trained framework can be used as an autoencoder to reconstruct test samples, where the trained discriminative encoder works as an encoder, and samples with reconstruction errors above a predefined threshold are determined as anomalies. The properties of quadratic potential divergence ensure a simple training process with comparable performance, meanwhile the discriminative encoder with two functions makes full use of training resources and reduces required network structures.

Often, their operation can be at risk by adversaries that launch attacks against the WSN with the aim of compromising the reliability and availability of the network and the respective application. The outcome of an attack highly depends on the experience of the adversary and his capabilities in terms of programming skills, security knowledge and resources. From the network perspective, the challenge is to reliably recover to a normal operation as soon as the adversary is been detected and allow for packet delivery to destination. The challenge is even greater in the presence of adversaries that adapt their intrusion strategy to break the deployed recovery countermeasures and continue affecting the network. Proposed recovery countermeasures typically assume the use of omni-directional antennas, which cannot take advantage of antenna directivity in order to manipulate communication paths between WSN nodes for the purpose of (physically) bypassing an adversary. This paper presents an intrusion recovery protocol in WSNs that uses directional antennas to create controlled communication paths, thus routing, and enhancing the reliability, self-healingness and resilience of the network. The proposed protocol is implemented within the AODV context and evaluated using ns-2. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol to deliver packets to the destination in the presence of multiple persistent adversaries that deploy different types of simple to extended attacks.","","978-1-4577-0024-8","10.1109/CTS.2011.5898964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5898964","WSN security;recovery;directional antennas;secure routing","Protocols;Routing;Wireless sensor networks;Throughput;Computer crime;Directional antennas","computer network reliability;computer network security;directive antennas;safety-critical software;wireless sensor networks","persistent adversaries;wireless sensor networks;directional antennas;security;mission-critical areas;decision-making;network reliability;network availability;ns-2","","2","","21","","20 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Middleware is generally introduced as an intermediate layer between WSNs and the end user to resolve some limitations, but most of the existing middleware is unable to protect data from malicious and unknown attacks during transmission. This paper introduces a secure wireless sensor network middleware (SWSNM) based on an unsupervised learning technique called generative adversarial network algorithm. SWSNM consists of two networks: a generator (G) network and a discriminator (D) network. The G creates fake data that are similar to the real sample and combines it with real data from the sensors to confuse the attacker. The D contains multi-layers that have the ability to differentiate between real and fake data. The output intended for this algorithm shows an actual interpretation of the data that is securely communicated through the WSN. The framework is implemented in Python with experiments performed using Keras. Results illustrate that SWSNM algorithm improves the accuracy of the data and enhances its security by protecting data from adversaries.

One of the biggest drivers for successful adoption of these models is how well domain experts and users are able to understand and trust their functionality. As these black-box models are being employed to make important predictions, the demand for transparency and explainability is increasing from the stakeholders.Explanations supporting the output of ML models are crucial in cyber security, where experts require far more information from the model than a simple binary output for their analysis. Recent approaches in the literature have focused on three different areas: (a) creating and improving explainability methods which help users better understand the internal workings of ML models and their outputs; (b) attacks on interpreters in white box setting; (c) defining the exact properties and metrics of the explanations generated by models. However, they have not covered, the security properties and threat models relevant to cybersecurity domain, and attacks on explainable models in black box settings.In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing a taxonomy for Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, covering various security properties and threat models relevant to cyber security domain. We design a novel black box attack for analyzing the consistency, correctness and confidence security properties of gradient based XAI methods. We validate our proposed system on 3 security-relevant data-sets and models, and demonstrate that the method achieves attacker's goal of misleading both the classifier and explanation report and, only explainability method without affecting the classifier output. Our evaluation of the proposed approach shows promising results and can help in designing secure and robust XAI methods.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-6926-2","10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9206780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9206780","Adversarial Attack;Explainable Artificial Intelligence;Cyber security;gradient-based XAI;deep learning","Data models;Computer security;Analytical models;Robustness;Privacy;Predictive models","artificial intelligence;data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","black box attack;cyber security;domain experts;black-box models;ML models;binary output;white box setting;exact properties;threat models;cybersecurity domain;black box settings;explainable artificial intelligence methods;security domain;XAI methods;security-relevant data-sets","","4","","37","","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Dynamic Information Flow Tracking (DIFT) has been proposed as a promising mechanism to detect and prevent various cyber attacks in computer systems. DIFT tracks suspicious information flows in the system and generates security analysis when anomalous behavior is detected. The number of information flows in a system is typically large and the amount of resources (such as memory, processing power and storage) required for analyzing different flows at different system locations varies. Hence, efficient use of resources is essential to maintain an acceptable level of system performance when using DIFT. On the other hand, the quickest detection of APTs is crucial as APTs are persistent and the damage caused to the system is more when the attacker spends more time in the system. We address the problem of detecting APTs and model the trade-off between resource efficiency and quickest detection of APTs. We propose a game model that captures the interaction of APT and a DIFT-based defender as a two-player, multi-stage, zero-sum, Stackelberg semi-Markov game. Our game considers the performance parameters such as false-negatives generated by DIFT and the time required for executing various operations in the system. We propose a two-time scale Q-learning algorithm that converges to a Stackelberg equilibrium under infinite horizon, limiting average payoff criteria.

Cyber agility has become a critical proactive security resource that makes it possible to measure defense adjustments and reactions to rising threats. Subsequently, machine learning has been applied to support cyber agility prediction as an essential effort to anticipate future security performance. Nevertheless, apt and treacherous actors motivated by economic incentives continue to prevail in circumventing machine learning-based protection tools. Adversarial learning, widely applied to computer security, especially intrusion detection, has emerged as a new area of concern for the recently recognized critical cyber agility prediction. The rationale is, if a sophisticated malicious actor obtains the cyber agility parameters, correct prediction cannot be guaranteed. Unless with a demonstration of white-box attack failures. The challenge lies in recognizing that unconstrained adversaries hold vast potential capabilities. In practice, they could have perfect-knowledge, i.e., a full understanding of the defense tool in use. We address this challenge by proposing an adversarial machine learning approach that achieves accurate cyber agility forecast through mapped nefarious influence on static defense tools metrics. Considering an adversary would aim at influencing perilous confidence in a defense tool, we demonstrate resilient cyber agility prediction through verified attack signatures in dynamic learning windows. After that, we compare cyber agility prediction under negative influence with and without our proposed dynamic learning windows. Our numerical results show the model's execution degrades without adversarial machine learning. Such a feigned measure of performance could lead to incorrect software security patching.","","978-1-6654-0443-3","10.1109/INFOCOMWKSHPS51825.2021.9484471","Howard University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9484471","adversarial machine learning;cyber agility;predictive analytics","Analytical models;Databases;Conferences;Tools;Predictive models;Propulsion;Adversarial machine learning","learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","machine learning-based protection tools;adversarial learning;computer security;cyber agility parameters;correct prediction;unconstrained adversaries;defense tool;accurate cyber agility forecast;static defense tools metrics;resilient cyber agility prediction;dynamic learning windows;adversarial machine learning;incorrect software security patching;security analysts;cyber-defense tools;advanced threats;persistent threats;critical proactive security resource;defense adjustments;future security performance;apt actors;augmented cyber agility prediction","","","","29","","19 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In contrast, researchers across disciplines have been incorporating deep learning into their research to solve problems that could not have been approached before. In this paper, we seek to provide a thorough investigation of deep learning in its applications and mechanisms. Specifically, as a categorical collection of state of the art in deep learning research, we hope to provide a broad reference for those seeking a primer on deep learning and its various implementations, platforms, algorithms, and uses in a variety of smart-world systems. Furthermore, we hope to outline recent key advancements in the technology, and provide insight into areas, in which deep learning can improve investigation, as well as highlight new areas of research that have yet to see the application of deep learning, but could nonetheless benefit immensely.

Nevertheless, attackers can bypass WAF's rules by using sophisticated SQL injection techniques. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to dissect the HTTP traffic and inspect complex SQL injection attacks. Our model is a hybrid Injection Prevention System (HIPS) which uses both a machine learning classifier and a pattern matching inspection engine based on reduced sets of security rules. Our Web Application Firewall architecture aims to optimize detection performances by using a prediction module that excludes legitimate requests from the inspection process.","","978-1-4799-8099-4","10.1109/ISIAS.2014.7064617","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7064617","SQL injection;Web Application Firewall;HTTP dissection;machine learning;Security rules","Servers","firewalls;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern matching;SQL;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","complex SQL injection attack detection;security threats;HTTP data streams;malicious HTTP transaction detection;WAF rules;hybrid injection prevention system;HIPS;machine learning classifier;pattern matching inspection engine;reduced sets;security rules;Web application firewall architecture;prediction module;legitimate requests","","12","2","13","","23 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many recent intrusion detection systems rely on accurate recovery of application semantics from memory. In this paper, we approach the problem from a different angle. We observe that the user applications in corporate network often run in identical system environments due to standardized IT deployment procedure. The same applications share similar runtime statistics across different workstations through out the time, despite different uses by the end users. When an application is compromised on one workstation, its runtime profile would be different from the rest, similar to how a black penguin would look distinctly different from the rest of the colony. In this work, we present our preliminary study on Black Penguin, a compare-view based intrusion detection system leveraging homogeneity of application-level memory statistics in corporate environment. The detection system follows a three-step process that includes memory analysis, unsupervised learning and risk mitigation. To explore the feasibility of Black Penguin, we conduct two types of experiments using Internet Explorer and Firefox as target applications. First, we examine the statistical differences of the same application under different user usage. To this end, we collect and analyze memory statistics of browser when visiting the top 500 websites ranked by Moz. Second, we examine the difference when the application is under attack. Several browser attacks are used to generate the intrusion samples. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of the approach. Lastly, we also provide discussions on the limitations of the proposed system as well as future directions.","","978-1-5386-0683-4","10.1109/CNS.2017.8228671","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8228671","","Feature extraction;Conferences;Semantics;Intrusion detection;Workstations;Unsupervised learning;Browsers","Internet;online front-ends;security of data;statistical analysis;unsupervised learning;Web sites","homogeneous memory;recent intrusion detection systems;application semantics;different angle;user applications;corporate network;identical system environments;standardized IT deployment procedure;similar runtime statistics;different workstations;different uses;end users;black penguin;application-level memory statistics;corporate environment;memory analysis;target applications;statistical differences;different user usage;intrusion samples;signature-based intrusion detection;runtime profile;compare-view based intrusion detection system;three-step process;unsupervised learning;risk mitigation;Internet Explorer;Firefox;Websites;Websites;browser attacks","","","","47","","21 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The communication with various external networks further reinforces the connectivity between the inside and outside of a vehicle. However, this bears risks of malicious packet attacks on computer-assisted mechanical mechanisms that are capable of hijacking the vehicle's functions. The present study proposes a method to detect and identify abnormalities in vehicular networks based on the periodic event-triggered interval of the controller area network (CAN) messages. To this end, we first define four attack scenarios and then extract normal and abnormal driving data corresponding to these scenarios. Next, we analyze the CAN ID's event-triggered interval and measure statistical moments depending on the defined time-window. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations of the proposed methods' performance by considering different attack scenarios and three types of machine learning models. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively detect an abnormality in the IVN, with up to 99% accuracy. Our results suggest that when tree-based machine learning models are used as the classifier, the proposed method of attack identification can achieve more than 94% accuracy.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2021.3069171","Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion (Development of Security Primitives for Unmanned Vehicles)(grant numbers:2020-0-00374); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9387321","Anomaly detection;attack identification;controller area network;event-triggered interval;in-vehicle network","Anomaly detection;Entropy;Vehicles;Safety;Receivers;Wireless communication;Protocols","computer network security;controller area networks;learning (artificial intelligence);vehicular ad hoc networks","external networks;wireless communication technology;vehicle communication technology;in-vehicle network;attack identification methods;event-triggered interval-based anomaly detection;tree-based machine learning models;IVN;different attack scenarios;defined time-window;CAN ID's event-triggered interval;abnormal driving data;normal driving data;controller area network messages;periodic event-triggered interval;vehicular networks;computer-assisted mechanical mechanisms;malicious packet attacks","","","","39","IEEE","26 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We define data-provenance integrity as the security property stating that the source where a piece of data is generated cannot be spoofed or tampered with. We describe a cryptographic provenance verification approach for ensuring system properties and system-data integrity at kernel-level. Its two concrete applications are demonstrated in the keystroke integrity verification and malicious traffic detection. Specifically, we first design and implement an efficient cryptographic protocol that enforces keystroke integrity by utilizing on-chip Trusted Computing Platform (TPM). The protocol prevents the forgery of fake key events by malware under reasonable assumptions. Then, we demonstrate our provenance verification approach by realizing a lightweight framework for restricting outbound malware traffic.

In this work, we focus the jamming attacks at the PHY and MAC layers in IEEE 802.5.4 low rate wireless personal area network (LR-WPAN). This type of attack not only blocks the ongoing communication in the network, but also causes the wireless nodes to exhaust their energy much earlier than expected. Collisions in wireless networks occur due to varying factors such as jamming attacks, hidden terminal interferences and network congestion. To increase the reliability of attack detection, it is necessary to provide enhanced detection mechanisms that can determine the actual cause of channel collisions. To address this, we designed a fuzzy logic system to detect the jamming attacks in IEEE 802.1.5.4. It is an attack detection mechanism which uses an anomaly based approach and operates in a distributed manner and we can distinguish attack scenarios from the impact of traffic load on network behavior.

Smart devices in our homes, offices, buildings, and cities can connect with other devices as well as with the physical world around them. This increasing popularity has also placed smart devices as the center of attention among attackers. Already, several types of malicious activities exist that attempt to compromise the security and privacy of smart devices. One interesting and noteworthy emerging threat vector is the attacks that abuse the use of sensors on smart devices. Smart devices are vulnerable to sensor-based threats and attacks due to the lack of proper security mechanisms available to control the use of sensors by installed apps. By exploiting the sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone, light sensor, etc.) on a smart device, attackers can extract information from the device, transfer malware to a device, or trigger a malicious activity to compromise the device. In this paper, we explore various threats and attacks abusing sensors of smart devices for malicious purposes. Specifically, we present a detailed survey about existing sensor-based threats and attacks to smart devices and countermeasures that have been developed to secure smart devices from sensor-based threats.

While datacenter networks can be protected using conventional cybersecurity measures, edge neural networks bring a host of new security challenges. Unlike classic IoT applications, edge neural networks are typically very compute and memory intensive, their execution is data-independent, and they are robust to noise and faults. Neural network models may be very expensive to develop, and can potentially reveal information about the private data they were trained on, requiring special care in distribution. The hidden states and outputs of the network can also be used in reconstructing user inputs, potentially violating users' privacy. Furthermore, neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which may cause misclassifications and violate the integrity of the output. These properties add challenges when securing edge-deployed DNNs, requiring new considerations, threat models, priorities, and approaches in securely and privately deploying DNNs to the edge. In this work, we cover the landscape of attacks on, and defenses, of neural networks deployed in edge devices and provide a taxonomy of attacks and defenses targeting edge DNNs.","2643-1971","978-1-7281-5020-8","10.1109/HPEC.2019.8916519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8916519","neural networks;security;Internet of Things","Neural networks;Data models;Data privacy;Training;Software;Mathematical model;Taxonomy","computer centres;data privacy;Internet of Things;neural nets;security of data","securing edge-deployed DNNs;defenses;datacenter networks;deep neural network workloads;adversarial attacks;edge-deployed neural networks;cybersecurity;IoT applications;private data","","7","","87","","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current methods assume that time interval or frequency of a normal message always keeps constant and detect abnormal messages by checking whether a message's time interval or frequency changes. However, through real CAN bus dataset analysis, we find that time interval and frequency of a normal message may change greatly in different vehicle driving conditions (such as Acceleration, Deceleration, and Driving mode shift), which can cause low detection accuracy of current methods. To handle this problem, in this paper, we propose a message transmission behavior based abnormal message detection system (MetraDS), which detects abnormal messages in CAN bus based on message transmission behaviors including frequency and message sequence. Through real dataset analysis, we find that a message's sequence usually does not change in different vehicle driving conditions, and also an abnormal message affects the frequency of itself and its subsequent messages. Accordingly, MetraDS checks message sequence dissimilarity to determine whether abnormal messages exist in a message sequence and then checks each message's influence to itself and its subsequent messages to locate the abnormal messages in the sequence. We used the real dataset to test the abnormal message detection performance of MetraDS in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that MetraDS improves the abnormal message detection accuracy of other methods by as much as 33.8%, and its memory and computational cost requirements are acceptable.","2575-8411","978-1-7281-7002-2","10.1109/ICDCS47774.2020.00041","Microsoft; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9355626","Abnormal message;driving conditions;message sequence","Time-frequency analysis;Conferences;Vehicle driving;Memory management;Distributed databases;Safety;Computational efficiency","automotive electronics;controller area networks;driver information systems;road safety;road vehicles","time interval;normal message;vehicle driving conditions;message transmission behavior;abnormal message detection system;subsequent messages;message sequence dissimilarity;abnormal message detection performance;abnormal message detection accuracy","","","","28","","23 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The community acknowledges that network security presents unique challenges for machine learning, and the lack of training data representative of modern traffic remains one of the most intractable issues. New attempts are continuously made to develop high quality benchmark datasets and proper data collection methodologies. The CICIDS2017 dataset is one of the recent results, created to meet the demanding criterion of representativeness for network intrusion detection. In this paper we revisit CICIDS2017 and its data collection pipeline and analyze correctness, validity and overall utility of the dataset for the learning task. During this in-depth analysis, we uncover a series of problems with traffic generation, flow construction, feature extraction and labelling that severely affect the aforementioned properties. We investigate the causes of these shortcomings and address most of them by applying an improved data processing methodology. As a result, more than 20 percent of original traffic traces are reconstructed or relabelled. Machine learning benchmarks on the final dataset demonstrate significant improvements. Our study exemplifies how data collection issues may have enormous impact on model evaluation and provides recommendations for their anticipation and prevention.","","978-1-6654-3732-5","10.1109/SPW53761.2021.00009","KU Leuven; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9474286","network intrusion detection;machine learning;benchmark dataset;data collection.","Network intrusion detection;Machine learning;Documentation;Data collection;Benchmark testing;Tools;Feature extraction","computer network security;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence)","CICIDS2017 dataset;network intrusion detection dataset;data collection;traffic generation;data processing;machine learning;network security;flow construction;feature extraction;feature labelling","","","","17","","8 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Attacks on those web applications are also increasing. One of the common web application attacks is SQL Injection attack. These attacks are a code injection or insertion of SQL query via input data from the client to the application. There are many detection techniques implemented, but they have focused on the SQL structure at the application level. So those techniques failed to detect some of the attacks at the database level. The existing approaches use classification techniques and suitable kernel functions to detect the attack at the database level. As the SVM classification is the supervised learning algorithm, the unknown attacks can't be detected. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework using the EDADT (Efficient Data Adaptive Decision Tree) algorithm which is the semi - supervised algorithm and SVM classification algorithm. It uses the internal query tree from the database log for good performance of framework. To get internal query tree, the query tree is converted to n - dimensional feature vector by using multi - dimensional sequence. The semantic features are used as the component of feature vector. And also the syntactic and semantic feature is used to generate multi - dimensional sequences. Then the extracted feature is converted into numeric value, if the feature contains any string value. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is more accurate in detecting the attacks than existing approaches.","","978-1-4673-9206-8","10.1109/ICACCS.2016.7586332","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7586332","SQL Injection Attack;Database;Data mining;SVM","Feature extraction;Databases;Support vector machines;Structured Query Language;Classification algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Semantics","decision trees;feature extraction;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);query processing;security of data;SQL;support vector machines;vectors","hybrid SQL injection detection system;database driven Web applications;SQL injection attack;SQL query;database level;SVM classification;supervised learning;EDADT;efficient data adaptive decision tree;internal query tree;feature vector;feature extraction","","3","","12","","10 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It converts a regular trigger to a noised trigger that can be easily concealed inside images for training NN, with the objective to plant a backdoor that can be later activated by the trigger. Compared with existing data poisoning backdoor attacks, this newfound attack has the following distinct properties. First, it is a blackbox attack, requiring zero-knowledge of the target model. Second, this attack utilizes ""invisible poison"" to achieve stealthiness where the trigger is disguised as `noise', and thus can easily evade human inspection. On the other hand, this noised trigger remains effective in the feature space to poison training data. Third, the attack is practical and aggressive. A backdoor can be effectively planted with a small amount of poisoned data and is robust to most data augmentation methods during training. The attack is fully tested on multiple benchmark datasets including MNIST, Cifar10, and ImageNet10, as well as application specific data sets such as Yahoo Adblocker and GTSRB.

By exploiting such vulnerabilities, we propose attack methods for revealing a victim program's data kept in GPU memory both during its execution and right after its termination. We further show the high applicability of the proposed attacks by applying them to the Chromium and Firefox web browsers which use GPUs for accelerating webpage rendering. We detect that both browsers leave rendered webpage textures in GPU memory, so that we can infer which web pages a victim user has visited by analyzing the remaining textures.

Blockchain-based data provenance can provide tamper-proof records, enable the transparency of data accountability in the cloud, and help to enhance the privacy and availability of the provenance data. We make use of the cloud storage scenario and choose the cloud file as a data unit to detect user operations for collecting provenance data. We design and implement ProvChain, an architecture to collect and verify cloud data provenance, by embedding the provenance data into blockchain transactions. ProvChain operates mainly in three phases: (1) provenance data collection, (2) provenance data storage, and (3) provenance data validation. Results from performance evaluation demonstrate that ProvChain provides security features including tamper-proof provenance, user privacy and reliability with low overhead for the cloud storage applications.","","978-1-5090-6611-7","10.1109/CCGRID.2017.8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7973733","Data provenance;Blockchain;Cloud Computing;Privacy;Reliability;Blockchain Cloud","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Data privacy;Security;History;Data models;Privacy","cloud computing;data integrity;data privacy;meta data;reliability;trusted computing","blockchain-based data provenance architecture;trusted cloud data provenance architecture;decentralized cloud data provenance architecture;tamper-proof records;data accountability;provenance data availability;ProvChain;provenance data collection;provenance data storage;provenance data validation;user privacy;cloud storage applications;metadata","","137","","31","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The purpose of our method is to improve the classification performance of semi-supervised learning models and rectify the incorrect pseudo labels in the process of training. Specifically, the algorithm is built with a deep convolutional neural network and an ensemble learning model. First, output smearing is employed to construct different training sets and perform model initialization. The pseudo labels of unlabeled data are inferred by network predictions. Second, based on selection and weighting strategies for pseudo labeled data, pseudo labeled data with high confidence are selected and added to the real labeled training set. Accordingly, the model is retrained on the weighted pseudo labeled data. Last, a mutual learning strategy is applied to enhance the prediction consistency among classifiers. Furthermore, diversity fine tuning and mutual learning are performed alternately to determine the optimal balance between diversity and consistency, which consequently improves the accuracy of the pseudo label predictions. The experimental results on three benchmark datasets, namely, MNIST, CIFAR10 and SVHN, demonstrate that the proposed method effectively rectifies the incorrect pseudo labels.

This makes this technology an ideal candidate for dealing with network management issues in satellite and terrestrial networks. One key innovation of SDN is the separation of the control plane from the data plane. This results in a new network element: the controller. Given the importance of the role of the logically centralised (physically distributed) controller, it becomes an important point to protect in the new SDN paradigm. It could be vulnerable to attacks that are common in traditional networks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). In this paper, we address a type of attack that could threaten the operation of SDN-based environments: poisoning attacks. To perform its function, the logically centralised controller must have an accurate view of the network state. The accuracy of this view is crucial to the operation of the network. This view is obtained by exchanging information among controllers and between controllers and network elements. Such information flow could be vulnerable to different types of poisoning attacks. The motivation for writing this paper is that (1) poisoning attacks on SDN networks could have great impact, (2) most of them are relatively recent and (3) the differences between such attacks could be subtle. Therefore, we address the issues by classifying poisoning attacks in SDN. We classify both attacks and defences. For attacks we make a distinction between direct poisoning attacks and attacks that are designed to evade a specific defence.","2380-7636","978-1-7281-2140-6","10.1109/WiSEE.2019.8920310","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920310","","Switches;Security;Satellites;Fabrication;Conferences;Wireless communication","computer network management;software defined networking","DDoS;distributed denial of service;satellite networks;SDN-based environment networks;direct poisoning attack classification;logically centralised controller;control plane;terrestrial networks;complex network management;software-defined networking","","","","14","","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Security in supply chain is challenging due to the inherent vulnerabilities and threats from any part of the system which can be exploited at any point within the supply chain. This can cause a severe disruption on the overall business continuity. Therefore, it is paramount important to understand and predicate the threats so that organization can undertake necessary control measures for the supply chain security. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) provides an intelligence analysis to discover unknown to known threats using various properties including threat actor skill and motivation, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedure (TT and P), and Indicator of Compromise (IoC). This paper aims to analyse and predicate threats to improve cyber supply chain security. We have applied Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) with Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyse and predict the threats based on the CTI properties. That allows to identify the inherent CSC vulnerabilities so that appropriate control actions can be undertaken for the overall cybersecurity improvement. To demonstrate the applicability of our approach, CTI data is gathered and a number of ML algorithms, i.e., Logistic Regression (LG), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT), are used to develop predictive analytics using the Microsoft Malware Prediction dataset. The experiment considers attack and TTP as input parameters and vulnerabilities and Indicators of compromise (IoC) as output parameters. The results relating to the prediction reveal that Spyware/Ransomware and spear phishing are the most predictable threats in CSC. We have also recommended relevant controls to tackle these threats. We advocate using CTI data for the ML predicate model for the overall CSC cyber security improvement.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3087109","Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University through the Vice Deanship of Scientific Research Chairs: Chair of Pervasive and Mobile Computing; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9448097","Cyber threat intelligence;machine learning;cyber supply chain;predictive analytic;cyber security;tactic techniques procedures","Supply chains;Machine learning;Prediction algorithms;Cyberattack;Computer security;Classification algorithms;Support vector machines","business continuity;computer crime;decision trees;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;security of data;support vector machines","Cyber Threat Intelligence;inherent CSC vulnerabilities;CTI data;predictable threats;CSC cyber security improvement;Cyber Threat predictive analytics;improving Cyber Supply Chain security;Cyber Supply Chain system;different sub-systems;known threats;properties including threat actor skill","","2","","40","CCBY","7 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We collected the network traffic from 3 online services in three different months within a year (23 million network requests). We develop a stream-based feature encoding scheme to support machine learning models for detecting advanced bots. The key novelty is that our model detects bots with extremely limited labeled data. We propose a data synthesis method to synthesize unseen (or future) bot behavior distributions. The synthesis method is distribution-aware, using two different generators in a Generative Adversarial Network to synthesize data for the clustered regions and the outlier regions in the feature space. We evaluate this idea and show our method can train a model that outperforms existing methods with only 1% of the labeled data. We show that data synthesis also improves the model's sustainability over time and speeds up the retraining. Finally, we compare data synthesis and adversarial retraining and show they can work complementary with each other to improve the model generalizability.","2375-1207","978-1-7281-3497-0","10.1109/SP40000.2020.00079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9152805","","CAPTCHAs;Data models;IP networks;Machine learning;Security;Training;Encoding","computer network security;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;telecommunication traffic","detecting bots;neural data augmentation;machine learning models;representative labeled data;bot detection;network traffic;advanced bots;model detects bots;data synthesis method;unseen bot behavior distributions;Generative Adversarial Network;model generalizability","","2","","82","","30 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, as models become more and more complex, people can hardly get the explanations behind their decisions. At the same time, most of the works about model interpretation focuses on other fields like computer vision, natural language processing, and biology. This leads to the fact that in practical use, cybersecurity experts can hardly optimize their decisions according to the judgments of the model. To solve these issues, a framework is proposed in this paper to give an explanation for IDSs. This framework uses SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and combines local and global explanations to improve the interpretation of IDSs. The local explanations give the reasons why the model makes certain decisions on the specific input. The global explanations give the important features extracted from IDSs, present the relationships between the feature values and different types of attacks. At the same time, the interpretations between two different classifiers, one-vs-all classifier and multiclass classifier, are compared. NSL-KDD dataset is used to test the feasibility of the framework. The framework proposed in this paper leads to improve the transparency of any IDS, and helps the cybersecurity staff have a better understanding of IDSs' judgments. Furthermore, the different interpretations between different kinds of classifiers can also help security experts better design the structures of the IDSs.

Recent studies have shown that GAN can also be applied to generate adversarial attack examples ( [2], [3]) to fool the machine-learning models. In comparison with the non-learning adversarial attack examples approaches, the GAN-based adversarial attack example approach can generate the adversarial samples quickly when facing a new sample after training, but meanwhile needs to perturb the attack samples in great quantities. To address this issue, we propose a new approach, named Few-Features-Attack-GAN (FFA-GAN). FFA-GAN has a significant time-consuming advantage than the non-learning adversarial attack samples approaches as it is based on the GAN architecture, and also has a better non-zero-features performance than the GAN-based adversarial sample attack approaches because of the introduction of the mask mechanism in the generator of GAN to confine the perturbations. Experiments are made respectively on the structured data sets KDD-Cup 1999 and CIC-IDS 2017, in which the dimensions of the data are relatively low, and also on the unstructured data sets MNIST and CIFAR-10 in which the data have the relatively high dimensions.

However, the growth of the information transfer rate expands the attack surface, offering a rich environment to intruders. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are widespread systems able to passively or actively control intrusive activities in a defined host and network perimeter. Recently, different IDSs have been proposed by integrating various detection techniques, generic or adapted to a specific domain and to the nature of attacks operating on. The cybersecurity landscape deals with tremendous diverse event streams that exponentially increase the attack vectors. Event stream processing (ESP) methods appear to be solutions that leverage event streams to provide actionable insights and faster detection. In this paper, we briefly describe domains (as well as their vulnerabilities) on which recent papers were-based. We also survey standards for vulnerability assessment and attack classification. Afterwards, we carry out a classification of IDSs, evaluation metrics, and datasets. Next, we provide the technical details and an evaluation of the most recent work on IDS techniques and ESP approaches covering different dimensions (axes): domains, architectures, and local communication technologies.

Two major factors on which the efficiency of an intelligent IDS model depends are - the data and the mechanism used by the model to learn the data. This paper focuses on the contribution of data, by performing an analysis of recently published datasets, namely, UNSW-NB15, Bot-IoT, and CSE-CIC-IDS2018, employing ML algorithms including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Keras Deep Learning models, and XGBoost.

Tasks from different users may be performed on the same machine. Therefore, one primary security concern is whether user data is secure in cloud. On the other hand, hacker may facilitate cloud computing to launch larger range of attack, such as a request of port scan in cloud with multiple virtual machines executing such malicious action. The hacker may perform a sequence of attacks in order to compromise his target system in a cloud, for example, compromsing an easy-to-exploit machine in the cloud and then using the compromised to attack the target. Such attack plan may be stealthy or inside the computing environment, so intrusion detection system or firewall has difficulty to identify it. The proposed detection system analyzes multiple logs from the cloud and extracts the intensions of the actions recorded in the logs. Stealthy reconnaissance actions are often neglected by administrator for the insignificant number of violations. Hidden Markov model is adopted to model the steps of the attack plan performed by hacker and such stealthy events in a long time frame will become significant in the state-aware model.

Outsourcing, however, raises some issues about result integrity: how could the client verify the mining results returned by the server are both sound and complete? In this paper, we focus on outlier mining, an important mining task. Previous verification techniques use an authenticated data structure (ADS) for correctness authentication, which may incur much space and communication cost. In this paper, we propose a novel solution that returns a probabilistic result integrity guarantee with much cheaper verification cost. The key idea is to insert a set of artificial records (ARs) into the dataset, from which it constructs a set of artificial outliers (AOs) and artificial non-outliers (ANOs). The AOs and ANOs are used by the client to detect any incomplete and/or incorrect mining results with a probabilistic guarantee. The main challenge that we address is how to construct ARs so that they do not change the (non-)outlierness of original records, while guaranteeing that the client can identify ANOs and AOs without executing mining. Furthermore, we build a strategic game and show that a Nash equilibrium exists only when the server returns correct outliers. Our implementation and experiments demonstrate that our verification solution is efficient and lightweight.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2017.2754493","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1350324,1464800); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8048342","Authentication;outsourcing;outlier mining;probabilistic guarantees;game theory","Servers;Authentication;Probabilistic logic;Outsourcing;Databases;Anomaly detection","data mining;data privacy;data structures;database management systems;game theory;outsourcing","authenticated outlier mining;outsourced databases;Data-Mining-as-a-Service paradigm;data owner;computational resources;third-party service provider;outsourcing;authenticated data structure;correctness authentication;communication cost;probabilistic result integrity guarantee;cheaper verification cost;artificial records;ARs;artificial outliers;AOs;nonoutliers;ANOs;incomplete mining results;incorrect mining results;probabilistic guarantee;outlierness","","2","","53","IEEE","21 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This assumption, however, causes inevitable performance degradation when a small fraction of abnormal data is included in the unlabeled dataset. To overcome the degradation and to maintain stable detection performance, we propose a semi-supervised anomaly detection algorithm using probabilistic labeling (SAD-PL) for unlabeled data. The proposed SAD-PL is composed of two steps: (1) estimating local outlier factor (LOF) scores of latent vectors from both labeled and unlabeled data and (2) estimating labeling probability on the unlabeled data by using the prior missing probability of the labeled data via the Neyman-Pearson (NP) criterion. The SAD-PL runs iteratively by using the proposed complementary learning functions until the rate of label changes is lower than the predefined threshold. Experimental results reveal that the SAD-PL shows superior detection probability over the existing algorithms and stable performance regardless of the normal to abnormal data ratio in unlabeled data and the ratio of change variation of unlabeled data statistics to labeled data statistics.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3120710","Defense Acquisition Program Administration; Agency for Defense Development in Korea(grant numbers:UD200011DD); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9576706","Anomaly detection;semi-supervised learning;probabilistic labeling;Neyman-Pearson criterion;local outlier factor","Labeling;Probabilistic logic;Anomaly detection;Training;Degradation;Licenses;Computational modeling","","","","","","30","CCBY","15 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, we examine the application of facial recognition. Deep learning techniques are at the top of the game for facial recognition, which means they have now been implemented in many production-level systems. Alarmingly, unlike other commercial technologies such as operating systems and network devices, deep learning-based facial recognition algorithms are not presently designed with security requirements or audited for security vulnerabilities before deployment. Given how young the technology is and how abstract many of the internal workings of these algorithms are, neural network-based facial recognition systems are prime targets for security breaches. As more and more of our personal information begins to be guarded by facial recognition (e.g., the iPhone X), exploring the security vulnerabilities of these systems from a penetration testing standpoint is crucial. Along these lines, we describe a general methodology for backdooring CNNs via targeted weight perturbations. Using a five-layer CNN and ResNet-50 as case studies, we show that an attacker is able to significantly increase the chance that inputs they supply will be falsely accepted by a CNN while simultaneously preserving the error rates for legitimate enrolled classes.","2474-9699","978-1-7281-9186-7","10.1109/IJCB48548.2020.9304875","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9304875","","Face recognition;Rootkit;Perturbation methods;Training;Error analysis;Task analysis;Target recognition","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);face recognition;security of data","convolutional neural networks;targeted weight perturbations;white-box backdoor attack;deep learning;security vulnerabilities;facial recognition systems;security breaches;penetration testing","","","","31","","6 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

IoT devices communicate through messaging bots. These bots are important in IoT systems to automate and better manage the work flows. IoT devices are usually spread across many applications and are able to capture or generate substantial influx of big data. The integration of IoT with cloud computing to handle and manage big data, requires considerable security measures in order to prevent cyber attackers from adversarial use of such large amount of data. An attacker can simply utilize the messaging bots to perform malicious activities on a number of devices and thus bots pose serious cybersecurity hazards for IoT devices. Hence, it is important to detect the presence of malicious bots in the network. In this paper we propose an evidence theory-based approach for malicious bot detection. Evidence Theory, a.k.a. Dempster Shafer Theory (DST) is a probabilistic reasoning tool and has the unique ability to handle uncertainty, i.e. in the absence of evidence. It can be applied efficiently to identify a bot, especially when the bots have dynamic or polymorphic behavior. The key characteristic of DST is that the detection system may not need any prior information about the malicious signatures and profiles. In this work, we propose to analyze the network flow characteristics to extract key evidence for bot traces. We then quantify these pieces of evidence using apriori algorithm and apply DST to detect the presence of the bots.","","978-1-5386-5035-6","10.1109/BigData.2018.8621895","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8621895","Internet of Things (IoT);Botnet;Big data;Bots;Dempster-Shafer Theory;Apriori Algorithm;Cyber Security","Botnet;Big Data;Internet of Things;Payloads;Feature extraction;IP networks;Computer science","Big Data;cloud computing;inference mechanisms;Internet of Things;invasive software;uncertainty handling","evidence theory;Internet of Things;cloud computing;cybersecurity;cyber attackers;Dempster Shafer Theory;probabilistic reasoning tool;uncertainty handling;apriori algorithm;evidence fusion;malicious signatures;malicious bot detection;big data;IoT systems","","4","","10","","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
