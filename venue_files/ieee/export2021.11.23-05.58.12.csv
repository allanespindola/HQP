The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerged as a field of study in Computer Science in the late 1950s. Researchers were interested in designing and developing systems that could behave like humans. While AI techniques are being applied to solve cyber security problems, the AI systems have to be protected. For example, how can the machine learning systems be protected from the attacks? What are the threats to the planning systems? How can expert system carry out their functions in the midst of malware attacks? What are the appropriate access control models for AI systems? How can we develop appropriate security policies for AI systems? These are questions that researchers are beginning to provide answers to. To assess the developments on the integration of AI and Security over the past decade and to determine future directions, the panel will focus on two major questions: (i) how can the developments in AI techniques be used to solve security problems and (ii) how can we ensure that the AI systems are secure and adapt to adversarial attacks? The panel will first provide an overview of the security and privacy considerations for AI systems. Second, it will describe the application of AI including machine learning for cyber security applications such as insider threat detection. Third, it will discuss the trends in areas such as adversarial machine learning that take into consideration the attacker’s behavior in developing machine learning techniques. Fourth, it will discuss some emerging trends in carrying out trustworthy AI so that the AI techniques can be secured against malicious attacks. Fifth, it will focus on the privacy threats due to the collection of massive amounts of data and potential solutions. Finally, it will discuss the integration of services computing including cloud-based services for AI and Security.","","978-1-7281-1337-1","10.1109/IRI.2019.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8843471","","Machine learning;Data privacy;Malware;Computer crime;Expert systems","","","","","","","","19 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

English Endowed Professor of Computer Science at Virginia Tech and a Fellow of the IEEE. Her research interests span many topics in the fields of wireless networks and cybersecurity. On wireless networks, her interests lie in distributed algorithms and lightweight protocols for wireless networks. Her previous works include algorithm and protocol design for ad hoc networks, multihop cooperative communications, opportunistic routing, and network coding. She has recently collaborated with other colleagues on interference cancellation, MIMO networks, and dynamic spectrum sharing, and 5G wireless communications. On cybersecurity, she has worked on many security and privacy topics in networked information systems, including anonymous authentication, encryption-based information access control and sharing, search over encrypted data, and confidential data computation. More recently, she has been working on block-chain and decentralized consensus protocols, securing 5G/nextG mobile networks, and adversarial machine learning and trustworthy AI systems. Her research goal is to develop innovative solutions to address fundamental research challenges in emerging technologies and critical infrastructures.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.2021.9606836","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9606836","","","","","","","","15","","8 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
