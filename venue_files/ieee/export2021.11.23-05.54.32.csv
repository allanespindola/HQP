"Defending Hardware-Based Malware Detectors Against Adversarial Attacks","A. P. Kuruvila; S. Kundu; K.

Traditional anti-virus software are ineffective against modern complex Malware. In order to address this challenge, researchers have proposed hardware-assisted Malware detection (HMD) using hardware performance counters (HPCs). The HPCs are used to train a set of machine learning (ML) classifiers, which in turn, are used to distinguish benign programs from Malware. Recently, adversarial attacks have been designed by introducing perturbations in the HPC traces using an adversarial sample predictor to misclassify a program for specific HPCs. These attacks are designed with the basic assumption that the attacker is aware of the HPCs being used to detect Malware. Since modern processors consist of hundreds of HPCs, restricting to only a few of them for Malware detection aids the attacker. In this article, we propose a moving target defense (MTD) for this adversarial attack by designing multiple ML classifiers trained on different sets of HPCs. The MTD randomly selects a classifier; thus, confusing the attacker about the HPCs or the number of classifiers applied. We have developed an analytical model which proves that the probability of an attacker to guess the perfect HPC-classifier combination for MTD is extremely low (in the range of $10^{-1864}$ for a system with 20 HPCs). Our experimental results prove that the proposed defense is able to improve the classification accuracy of HPC traces that have been modified through an adversarial sample generator by up to 31.5%, for a near perfect (99.4%) restoration of the original accuracy.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2020.3026960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9206535","Adversarial attacks;hardware performance counters (HPCs);machine learning (ML);Malware","Malware;Resists;Hardware;Program processors;Detectors;Generators","invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);system monitoring","hardware performance counters;machine learning classifiers;adversarial attack;HPC traces;adversarial sample predictor;MTD;multiple ML classifiers;perfect HPC-classifier combination;adversarial sample generator;hardware-based malware detectors;anti-virus software;modern complex malware;hardware-assisted malware detection","","2","","41","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In essence intrusion detection is a classification problem to judge normal or abnormal behaviors according to network traffic characteristics, and deep learning has been applied to intrusion detection recently. However, due to the lack of training data in some systems such as industrial control systems and smart grid, the deep-learning algorithm cannot give full play to its advantages. To solve this problem, we propose a transfer-learning-based network flow generation framework for deep-learning-based intrusion detection, which uses invariant extraction and sequence to sequence generation, to extract the attack invariant of the existing attack data set and transfer the knowledge to the target network system.

In this paper we explore time windows as a technique for generating more effective and descriptive features for attack classification. We suggest a framework for feature generation and selection that uses Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and time window exploration. Our initial results when applying this framework indicate that there is up to 47% improvement of F1 scores in attack classification when attack features are generated over a variety of time windows, compared to a single, global time window. We find that features calculated over longer lengths of time may be more useful for detecting attacks than over shorter lengths of time.

Existing attacks operate either by physical manipulation of the bus signals or message injection. However, we argue that these cannot simultaneously be remote, stealthy, and reliable. For instance, message injection is detected by modern Intrusion Detection System (IDS) proposals and requires strict synchronization that cannot be realized remotely. In this work, we introduce a new class of attacks that leverage the peripheral clock gating feature in modern automotive microcontroller units (MCUs). By using this capability, a remote adversary with purely software control can reliably ""freeze"" the output of a compromised ECU to insert arbitrary bits at any time instance. Utilizing on this insight, we develop the CANnon attack for remote shutdown. Since the CANnon attack produces error patterns indistinguishable from natural errors and does not require message insertion, detecting it with current techniques is difficult. We demonstrate this attack on two automotive MCUs used in modern passenger vehicle ECUs.

To compute the attacker's strategy for security evaluation we develop a receding-horizon planning algorithm using a risk-sensitive Markov decision process with a time-varying reward function. Finally we implement both defense and attack strategies in a synthetic network and analyze how the frequency of network randomization and the number of detection systems can influence the success rate of the attacker.

However, attackers use Artificial Intelligence to improve their attacks and circumvent IDS systems. Botnets use artificial intelligence to improve their Domain Name Generation Algorithms. Botnets pose a serious threat to networks that are connected to the Internet and are an enabler for many cyber-criminal activities (e.g., DDoS attacks, banking fraud and cyber-espionage) and cause substantial economic damage. To circumvent detection and prevent takedown actions, bot-masters use DGAs to create, maintain and hide C&C infrastructures. Furthermore, botmasters often release its source code to prevent detection, leading to numerous similar botnets that are created and maintained by different botmasters. As these botnets are based on nearly the same source code basis, they often share similar observable behavior. Current work on detection of DGAs is often based on applying machine learning techniques, as they are capable to generalize and to also detect yet unknown derivatives of a known botnets. However, these machine learning based classifiers can be circumvented by applying adversarial learning techniques. As a consequence, there is a need for resilience against adversarial learning in current Intrusion Detection Systems. In our work, we focus on adversarial learning in DNS based IDSs from the perspective of a network operator. Further, we present our concept to make existing and future machine learning based IDSs more resilient against adversarial learning attacks by applying multi-level Moving Target Defense strategies.","2374-9709","978-1-7281-4973-8","10.1109/NOMS47738.2020.9110332","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9110332","Adversarial Learning;Resilience;DGA;Botnet;Proactive Detection","","computer crime;Internet;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","DGAs;source code;adversarial learning techniques;intrusion detection systems;adversarial learning attacks;adversarial resilience;proactive detection;artificial intelligence;domain name generation algorithms;cyber-criminal activities;botnet domain names;MTD","","","","25","","8 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The existing methods for moving object detection (MOD) only computes class-agnostic pixel-wise binary segmentation of video frames. On the other hand, the object detection techniques do not differentiate between static and moving objects. To the best of our knowledge, this is a first attempt for simultaneous localization and classification of moving objects in a video, i.e. MOR in a single-stage deep learning framework. We achieve this by labelling axis-aligned bounding boxes for moving objects which requires less computational resources than producing pixel-level estimates. In the proposed MotionRec, both temporal and spatial features are learned using past history and current frames respectively. First, the background is estimated with a temporal depth reductionist (TDR) block. Then the estimated background, current frame and temporal median of recent observations are assimilated to encode spatiotemporal motion saliency. Moreover, feature pyramids are generated from these motion saliency maps to perform regression and classification at multiple levels of feature abstractions. MotionRec works online at inference as it requires only few past frames for MOR. Moreover, it doesn't require predefined target initialization from user. We also annotated axis-aligned bounding boxes (42,614 objects (14,814 cars and 27,800 person) in 24,923 video frames of CDnet 2014 dataset) due to lack of available benchmark datasets for MOR.

Most of systems which manage the databases and its requirements such as MySQL Server and PostgreSQL use SQL as their language. Flexibility of SQL makes it a powerful language. It allows its users to ask what he/she wants without leaking any information about how the data will be fetched. However the vast use of SQL based databases has made it the center of attention of hackers. They take advantage of the poorly coded Web applications to attack the databases. They introduce an apparent SQL query, through an unauthorized user input, into the legitimate query statement. In this paper, we have tried to present a comprehensive review of all the different types of SQL injection attacks present, as well as detection of such attacks and preventive measure used. We have highlighted their individual strengths and weaknesses. Such a classification would help other researchers to choose the right technique for further studies.","","978-1-4799-7984-4","10.1109/ICCCNT.2015.7395166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7395166","SQL injection;Detection;Prevention;Web application vulnerability;Information security","Databases;Servers;Irrigation;Lead;Decision support systems","Internet;pattern classification;query processing;relational databases;security of data;SQL","SQL injection attack;security threat;Internet;Web application;SQL based database;SQL query;attack classification","","3","","19","","1 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We model an attacker that can compromise a subset of sensors in a ICS which has a LSTM based IDS. The attacker manipulates the data sent to the IDS, and seeks to hide the presence of real cyber-physical attacks occurring in the ICS. We evaluate our adversarial attack methodology on the Secure Water Treatment system when examining solely continuous data, and on data containing a mixture of discrete and continuous variables. In the continuous data domain our attack successfully hides the cyber-physical attacks requiring 2.87 out of 12 monitored sensors to be compromised on average.

Generally, the DDoS attacks in such an environment have been implemented by flooding a huge volume (high-rate) of malicious traffic to exhaust the victim servers’ resources. Due to this huge volume of malicious traffic, such attacks can be easily detected. Thus, attackers are getting attracted towards the low-rate DDoS attacks, slowly. Low-rate DDoS attacks are difficult to detect due to their stealthy and low-rate traffic. In the recent years, many efforts have been devoted to defend against the low-rate DDoS attacks. By utilizing the salient features of cloud computing, it becomes easy for an attacker to launch sophisticated low-rate DDoS attacks. Thus, the study of various DDoS attacks and their corresponding defense approaches becomes essential to protect the cloud infrastructure from fatal effects of DDoS attacks. This paper presents a comprehensive taxonomy of all the possible variants of cloud DDoS attacks solutions with detailed insight into the characterization, prevention, detection, and mitigation mechanisms. The paper provides a detailed discussion on essential performance metrics to evaluate various defense solutions and their behavior in a cloud environment.

Attackers may non-invasively compromise sensors and spoof the controller to perform unsafe actions. This issue is even emphasized with the increasing autonomy in CPS. While this fact has motivated many defense mechanisms against sensor attacks, a clear vision on the timing and usability (or the false alarm rate) of attack detection still remains elusive. Existing works tend to pursue an unachievable goal of minimizing the detection delay and false alarm rate at the same time, while there is a clear trade-off between the two metrics. Instead, we argue that attack detection should bias different metrics when a system sits in different states. For example, if the system is close to unsafe states, reducing the detection delay is preferable to lowering the false alarm rate, and vice versa. To achieve this, we make the following contributions. In this paper, we propose a real-time adaptive sensor attack detection framework. The framework can dynamically adapt the detection delay and false alarm rate so as to meet a detection deadline and improve the usability according to different system status. The core component of this framework is an attack detector that identifies anomalies based on a CUSUM algorithm through monitoring the cumulative sum of difference (or residuals) between the nominal (predicted) and observed sensor values. We augment this algorithm with a drift parameter that can govern the detection delay and false alarm. The second component is a behavior predictor that estimates nominal sensor values fed to the core component for calculating the residuals. The predictor uses a deep learning model that is offline extracted from sensor data through leveraging convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN). The model relies on little knowledge of the system (e.g., dynamics), but uncovers and exploits both the local and complex long-term dependencies in multivariate sequential sensor measurements. The third component is a drift adaptor that estimates a detection deadline and then determines the drift parameter fed to the detector component for adjusting the detection delay and false alarms. Finally, we implement the proposed framework and validate it using realistic sensor data of automotive CPS to demonstrate its efficiency and efficacy.","2642-7346","978-1-6654-0386-3","10.1109/RTAS52030.2021.00027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9470469","autonomous cyber-physical systems;security;physical attacks;real-time;detection","Measurement;Deep learning;Recurrent neural networks;Detectors;Prediction algorithms;Sensor systems;Real-time systems","computerised instrumentation;cyber-physical systems;deep learning (artificial intelligence);sensors","cyber attacks;false alarm rate;detection delay;attack detector;multivariate sequential sensor measurements;adaptive sensor attack detection framework;physical attack processing;autonomous cyber-physical systems;CPS;CUSUM algorithm;cumulative sum of difference algorithm;CNN;convolutional neural network","","","","62","","7 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We address those shortcomings by (1) using power measurements from the host to ensure that the checking code is executed and (2) checking a subset of the kernel space over an extended period. We compare the power measurement against a learned power model of the execution of the machine and validate that the execution was not tampered. Finally, POWERALERT randomizes the integrity checking program to prevent the attacker from adapting. We model the interaction between POWERALERT and an attacker as a time-continuous game. The Nash equilibrium strategy of the game shows that POWERALERT has two optimal strategy choices: (1) aggressive checking that forces the attacker into hiding, or (2) slow checking that minimizes cost. We implement a prototype of POWERALERT using Raspberry Pi and evaluate the performance of the integrity checking program generation.","2158-3927","978-1-5386-5596-2","10.1109/DSN.2018.00059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8416511","integrity checking;game theory;attestation;power attestation","Current measurement;Kernel;Security;Adaptation models;Protocols;Frequency measurement","data integrity;game theory;power aware computing","code segment;network round-trip time;power measurement;checking code;POWERALERT;Nash equilibrium strategy;integrity checking program generation;game-theoretic strategy;timing information;attestation systems;Raspberry Pi","","","","30","","23 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve this, we formulate the problem of fine-grained known/unknown intrusion detection as a two-stage minimization problem, where the first stage is to seek a score measure for minimizing the empirical risk of misclassifying the known attacks, while the second stage is to find another score measure for minimizing the identification risk of inferring unknown attacks. The hierarchical nature of problem formulation allows us to employ the class conditioned auto-encoders to construct a hierarchical intrusion detection framework. Since the reconstruction errors of unknown attacks are generally higher than that of the known attacks, we further employ extreme value theory in the second stage to model the distribution of reconstruction errors for differentiating known/unknown attack. To further reduce the false positive rate, we add a benign clustering module for learning the multimodal distribution of benign traffic.

The highly interconnected SGCN network is susceptible to packet dropping attacks between data aggregation points. In this paper, a probability based trust calculation method is proposed to thwart the malicious packet dropping attack. Trust evaluation is done using one-hop, multi-hop, hybrid and total trust to thwart malicious attacks. At each stage, suitable equations are provided to eliminate misbehaving attack, on-off attack and bad-mouthing attack. Simulations are conducted to determine the significant performance of the trust based network by changing the number of fraudulent nodes.

However, this paper shows that the separation of the control plane from the data plane, which lies at the heart of Software-Defined Networks (SDNs), introduces a new vulnerability which we call teleportation. An attacker (e.g., a malicious switch in the data plane or a host connected to the network) can use teleportation to transmit information via the control plane and bypass critical network functions in the data plane (e.g., a firewall), and to violate security policies as well as logical and even physical separations. This paper characterizes the design space for teleportation attacks theoretically, and then identifies four different teleportation techniques. We demonstrate and discuss how these techniques can be exploited for different attacks (e.g., exfiltrating confidential data at high rates), and also initiate the discussion of possible countermeasures.

Application layer DDoS attacks, such as Slow Read, are implemented with just enough traffic to tie up CPU or memory resources causing web and application servers to go offline. Such attacks can mimic legitimate network requests making them difficult to detect. They also utilize less volume than traditional DDoS attacks. These low volume attack methods can often go undetected by network security solutions until it is too late. In this paper, we explore the use of machine learners for detecting Slow Read DDoS attacks on web servers at the application layer. Our approach uses a generated dataset based upon Netflow data collected at the application layer on a live network environment. Our Netflow data uses the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) standard providing significant flexibility and features. These Netflow features can process and handle a growing amount of traffic and have worked well in our previous DDoS work detecting evasion techniques. Our generated dataset consists of real-world network data collected from a production network. We use eight different classifiers to build Slow Read attack detection models. Our wide selection of learners provides us with a more comprehensive analysis of Slow Read detection models. Experimental results show that the machine learners were quite successful in identifying the Slow Read attacks with a high detection and low false alarm rate. The experiment demonstrates that our chosen Netflow features are discriminative enough to detect such attacks accurately.","","978-1-5386-2659-7","10.1109/IRI.2018.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8424694","Application Layer DDoS Attacks, Netflow, Slow Read, SiLK, IPFIX","Computer crime;Web servers;Protocols;Open systems;Tools","computer network security;file servers;Internet;invasive software;IP networks;learning (artificial intelligence)","Netflow data;computer networks;application layer DDoS attacks;memory resources;application servers;legitimate network requests;low volume attack methods;network security solutions;machine learners;IP Flow Information Export standard;Web servers;slow read attack detection models;malware;distributed denial of service;slow read DDoS attacks;classifiers;false alarm rate;IPFIX standard","","6","","41","","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These QR-CPS testbed environments provide a realistic platform for conducting the Grid Exercise (GridEx), CPS security training, and attack-defense exercise at a broader scale for the cybersecurity of Energy Delivery Systems. The NERC has established a tabletop based GridEx platform for the North American power utilities to demonstrate how they would respond to and recover from cyber threats and incidents. The NERC-GridEx is a bi-annual activity with tabletop attack injects and incidence response management. There is a significant need to build a testbed-based hands-on GridEx for the utilities by leveraging the CPS testbeds, which imitates the pragmatic CPS grid environment. We propose a CPS testbed-based Quasi-Realistic Grid Exercise (QR-GridEx), which is a model after the NERC's tabletop GridEx. We have designed the CPS testbed-based QR-GridEx into two parts. Part-I focuses on the modeling of synthetic grid models for the utilities, including SCADA and WAMS communications, and attack-and-defense software systems; and the Part-II focuses on the incident response management and risk-based CPS grid investment strategies. This paper presents the Part-I of the CPS testbed-based QRGridEx, which includes modeling of the synthetic grid models in the real-time digital simulator, stealthy, and coordinated cyberattack vectors, and integration of intrusion/anomaly detection systems. We have used our existing HIL CPS security testbed to demonstrate the testbed-based QR-GridEx for a Texas-2000 bus US synthetic grid model and the IEEE-39 bus grid models. The experiments demonstrated significant results by 100% real-time performance with zero overruns for grid impact characteristics against stealthy and coordinated cyberattack vectors.","","978-1-7281-8693-1","10.1109/RWS50334.2020.9241284","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9241284","Grid Exercise;Hardware-in-the-loop;North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC);Power and Cyber System Testbed;SCADA;and WAMS","Training;ISO Standards;Computational modeling;Software systems;Real-time systems;Power industry;Cyberattack","computer network security;investment;power engineering computing;power grids;power system measurement;power system security;SCADA systems;security of data","tabletop attack injects;incidence response management;CPS testbeds;pragmatic CPS grid environment;CPS testbed-based QuasiRealistic Grid Exercise;NERC's tabletop GridEx;synthetic grid model;attack- defense software systems;-defense software systems;incident response management;QRGridEx;existing HIL CPS security;testbed-based QR-GridEx;IEEE-39 bus grid models;grid impact characteristics;generation CPS testbed-based Grid Exercise;defense modeling;QuasiRealistic cyber-physical system;QR-CPS;operational environment;cyber attack-defense algorithms;wide-area resilient power systems;realistic platform;CPS security training;attack-defense exercise;Energy Delivery Systems;GridEx platform;North American power utilities;cyber threats","","","","31","","2 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With this in mind, this paper presents a novel framework for incorporating active learning techniques into hardware security field. We demonstrate that active learning can significantly improve the learning efficiency of physical unclonable function (PUF) modeling attack, which samples the least confident and the most informative challenge-response pair (CRP) for training in each iteration. For example, our experimental results show that in order to obtain a prediction error below 4%, 2790 CRPs are required in passive learning, while only 811 CRPs are required in active learning. The sampling strategies and detailed applications of PUF modeling attack under various environmental conditions are also discussed. When the environment is very noisy, active learning may sample a large number of mislabeled CRPs and hence result in high prediction error.

The most complex type of cyberthreat is the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack that is usually backed by one or more states and lunched using a range of clandestine techniques aiming at high-value targets. Finding the source of the attackers and the associated campaign behind the threats can lead to taking an optimum defense decision in a more timely fashion. Threat attribution is an act of attributing an attack to the source of the attack. Threat attribution can not be fully achieved by a single piece of evidence (i.e. single view) from malicious actors as the evidence could get obfuscated by the actor to evade the detection mechanism. In this article, we propose a multi-view fuzzy consensus clustering model for attributing cyber threat payloads (malware) to its actor. We conduct over 4000 experiments to find out the best combinations of all 12 extracted views for the attribution task. Our experiments use five well-know APT families payloads. To avoid bias in the results, we apply a fuzzy pattern tree and multi-modal fuzzy classifier for our inference engines of all views. To define an optimum distinction among the malicious actor's behavior we implemented the consensus clustering technique. The comparison analysis of a single-view versus multi-view result justifies a significant improvement in the accuracy rate of attribution for all actors. The obtained results from the multi-view aspect of our proposed model give 95.2% accuracy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3012907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9152031","Advanced persistent threat;consensus clustering;cybersecurity;fuzzy;machine learning;malware;multi-view learning;threat attribution","Malware;Task analysis;Payloads;IP networks;Tools;Engines;Computer crime","fuzzy set theory;inference mechanisms;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;trees (mathematics)","single-view;multiview fuzzy consensus clustering model;malicious acts;advanced persistent threat attack;optimum defense decision;cyber threat payloads;attribution task;malicious actor;malware threat attribution;APT;fuzzy pattern tree;multimodal fuzzy classifier;inference engines;MVFCC;machine learning","","1","","30","CCBY","29 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many such devices sense the deployed environment and generate a variety of data and send them to the server for analysis as data streams. A Data Stream Manager (DSM) at the server collects the data streams (often called big data) to perform real time analysis and decision-making for these critical applications. A malicious adversary may access or tamper with the data in transit. One of the challenging tasks in such applications is to assure the trustworthiness of the collected data so that any decisions are made on the processing of correct data. Assuring high data trustworthiness requires that the system satisfies two key security properties: confidentiality and integrity. To ensure the confidentiality of collected data, we need to prevent sensitive information from reaching the wrong people by ensuring that the right people are getting it. Sensed data are always associated with different sensitivity levels based on the sensitivity of emerging applications or the sensed data types or the sensing devices. For example, a temperature in a precision agriculture application may not be as sensitive as monitored data in smart health. Providing multilevel data confidentiality along with data integrity for big sensing data streams in the context of near real time analytics is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a Selective Encryption (SEEN) method to secure big sensing data streams that satisfies the desired multiple levels of confidentiality and data integrity. Our method is based on two key concepts: common shared keys that are initialized and updated by DSM without requiring retransmission, and a seamless key refreshment process without interrupting the data stream encryption/decryption. Theoretical analyses and experimental results of our SEEN method show that it can significantly improve the efficiency and buffer usage at DSM without compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the data streams.","2332-7790","","10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2702172","AISRF-08140; ARC(grant numbers:LP140100816); NSF(grant numbers:1652107); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7921576","Big data stream;selective encryption;data confidentiality;data integrity;data security","Big data;Real-time systems;Sensors;Encryption","Big Data;cryptography;data integrity;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","decision-making;selective encryption method;multilevel data confidentiality;resource constrained sensing devices;self-organizing wireless sensor networks;sensed data types;high data trustworthiness;big data;Data Stream Manager;critical applications;big sensing data streams;data integrity;smart health","","10","","50","IEEE","8 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Conventional methods used to identify anomalies cannot be applied due to the resource-constrained and heterogeneous nature of the IoT devices. To address this, a novel approach that leverages the power consumption of these devices needs to be devised. Towards this goal, a smart home scenario is simulated using Smart Cameras and brute-force, and DDoS attacks were launched to capture variations in power profile. Further, we develop machine learning models to detect anomalies based on the power consumption traces.

The latter consists of local file inclusion and remote file inclusion. Our empirical analysis reveals that compared with existing research, gathering multiple signatures approach (GMSA) executes a precision performance (accuracy of the proposed algorithm is 99.45%). The false positive rate (FPR) of GMSA is 0.59%, which is low compared with what other research has reported. The low FPR is the most important factor. Ideally, the defense algorithm should balance between the FPR and true positive rate (TPR) because with existing methodologies, security experts can defend against a broad range of CIAs with uncomplicated security software. Typical protection methods yield a high FPR. Our method results in high TPR while minimizing the resources needed to address the false positive. GMSA can detect four types of CIA.

In this paper, our goal is to increase the accuracy of HMDs, to improve detection, and reduce overhead. We use specialized detectors targeted towards a specific type of malware to improve the detection of each type. Next, we use ensemble learning techniques to improve the overall accuracy by combining detectors. We explore detectors based on logistic regression (LR) and neural networks (NN). The proposed detectors reduce the false-positive rate by more than half compared to using a single detector, while increasing their sensitivity. We develop metrics to estimate detection overhead; the proposed detectors achieve more than 16.6× overhead reduction during online detection compared to an idealized software-only detector, with an 8× improvement in relative detection time.

Initially, during an offline phase, a state-based model of the network is generated, and security-level of each state is measured using a generic and easy-to-compute metric. EliMet then passively observes system operators' online reactive behavior against security incidents, and accordingly refines the calculated security measure values. Finally, to make the values comply with the expert knowledge, EliMet actively queries operators regarding those states for which sufficient information was not gained during the passive observation.

However, such neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples. An adversarial example is a sample created by adding a little noise to the original sample data and that, although presenting no change identifiable to human perception, will be misclassified by a deep neural network. Most studies on adversarial examples have focused on images, but research is expanding to include the field of text. Textual adversarial examples can be useful in certain situations, such as when models of both friend and enemy coexist, as in a military scenario. Here, a specific message may be generated as an adversarial example such that no grammatical or semantic problems are apparent to human perception and it will be correctly classified by the friend model but incorrectly classified by the enemy model. In this paper, I propose a “friend-guard” textual adversarial example for a text classification system. Unlike the existing methods for generating image adversarial examples, the proposed method creates adversarial examples designed to be misclassified by an enemy model and correctly classified by a friend model while retaining the meaning and grammar of the original sentence by replacing words of importance with substitutions. Experiments were conducted using a movie review dataset and the TensorFlow library. The experimental results show that the proposed method can generate an adversarial example that will be correctly classified with 88.2% accuracy by the friend model and 26.1% accuracy by the enemy model.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3080680","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:2021R1I1A1A01040308); Korea Military Academy Cyber Warfare Research Center(grant numbers:2021 (21-center-1)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9432814","Machine learning;Text classification;Text adversarial example;Evasion Attack;Deep neural network (DNN)","Bit error rate;Neural networks;Grammar;Text recognition;Distortion;Context modeling;Tokenization","","","","","","","CCBY","17 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Uncovering malicious and contaminated objects in an attacked computing system is referred to as identification of attack ramifications. Previous methods identify the attack ramifications by directly tracking information flows (or dependences) from the intrusion root (i.e., the entry point of an attack). They face challenges such as undetermined intrusion root and dependence explosion. In this paper, we present a novel, light-weight method capable of identifying attack ramifications without the knowledge of intrusion root and less subject to dependency explosion. The method utilizes a probabilistic reasoning approach to fuse evidence derived from a subset of objects whose security states are known. It first splits the lifetime of an object into consecutive time slices (object-slices) to profile how the security state of this object changes over time. Then, a temporal dependence network (TDN) is constructed from system call traces to correlate object-slices according to information flows between them. Based on that, a Bayesian network (BN) model is built to characterize the uncertainties of infection propagations in the TDN. Finally, the method adopts loopy belief propagation on the BN model to infer the security state of an object. We evaluate the proposed method using a large data set of 389 attacks launched by the real-world malware samples including sophisticated ones such as Stuxnet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is able to identify attack ramifications with a 97.47% precision at 97.21% recall without the knowledge of intrusion root.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2018.2833048","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772415,61375040); 111 International Collaboration Program of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8353880","APT attack;post-mortem analysis;intrusion detection;system security;attack ramifications;secure recovery","Security;Probabilistic logic;Explosions;Object recognition;Malware;Bayes methods;Uncertainty","belief networks;inference mechanisms;invasive software;probability;uncertainty handling","attack ramifications;dependency explosion;dependence explosion;undetermined intrusion root;attacked computing system;contaminated objects;uncovering malicious objects;temporal dependence network;object-slices","","2","","44","IEEE","3 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, some operational security mechanisms have been designed to deal with malicious code in SDN. However, most of those approaches require a signature basis and present the inability to anticipate novel malicious activity. Other anomaly based approaches are inefficient due to the possibility of an attacker simulates legitimate traffic, which causes lots of false alarms. Thus, in this paper, we present an anomaly based approaches that uses machine learning algorithms over continuous data stream for intrusion detection in a SDN environment. Our approach is to overcome the main challenges that happen when developing an anomaly based system using machine learning algorithms. For characterising the anomalies, we have analysed a type of DDoS attack classified as infrastructure attack that considers the impact of both bandwidth and resource depletions. This type of attack imposes a high affect to the whole SDN. In fact, there are two types of attacks. The bandwidth depletion attack targets the channel between the switches and the controller through either UDP or HTTP flooding.

Indeed, a large volume of Tor traffic is used for malicious purposes such as fast port scans, hacking attempts, ex-filtration of stolen credentials, etc. This makes Tor traffic detection an important component of intrusion detection and prevention systems. Hence, in this paper we present a deep neural network (DNN) based system for the detection and classification of encrypted Tor traffic. The system achieved 99.89% accuracy in the classification of Tor and non-Tor traffic on the UNB-CIC Tor network dataset. Experiments conducted for classifying Tor traffic types demonstrated an accuracy of 95.6%, which is 6.2% higher than previous work on the same dataset. Additionally, the robustness of the proposed DNN classifier is evaluated using adversarial samples generated from a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).

Not with standing the computational limitations of individual robots, such systems rely on collaboration to sense and react to the environment. This paper formulates the generic target tracking problem as a time-varying optimization problem and puts forth an inexact online gradient descent method for solving it sequentially. The performance of the proposed algorithm is studied by characterizing its dynamic regret, a notion common to the online learning literature. Building upon the existing results, we provide improved regret rates that not only allow nonstrongly convex costs but also explain the role of the cumulative gradient error. Two distinct classes of problems are considered: one in which the objective function adheres to a quadratic growth condition, and another where the objective function is convex but the variable belongs to a compact domain. For both cases, results are developed while allowing the error to be either adversarial or arising from a white noise process. Further, the generality of the proposed framework is demonstrated by developing online variants of existing stochastic gradient algorithms and interpreting them as special cases of the proposed inexact gradient method. The efficacy of the proposed inexact gradient framework is established on a multiagent multitarget tracking problem, while its flexibility is exemplified by generating online movie recommendations for Movielens 10M dataset.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2018.2797423","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8268092","Time varying optimization;stochastic optimization;target tracking;gradient descent methods","Target tracking;Signal processing algorithms;Gradient methods;Convex functions;Heuristic algorithms;Stochastic processes","gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;optimisation;stochastic processes;target tracking;white noise","inexact online gradient descent algorithm;multiagent systems;complex tasks;intrusion detection;individual robots;generic target tracking problem;time-varying optimization problem;dynamic regret;online learning literature;nonstrongly convex costs;cumulative gradient error;objective function;quadratic growth condition;online variants;stochastic gradient algorithms;inexact gradient method;inexact gradient framework;multiagent multitarget tracking problem;online movie recommendations;inexact online gradient descent method","","11","","53","IEEE","24 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose two methods to generate DDoS adversarial samples, named Genetic Attack (GA) and Probability Weighted Packet Saliency Attack (PWPSA) respectively. Both methods modify original input sample by inserting or replacing partial packets. In GA, we evolve a set of modified samples with genetic algorithm and find the evasive variant from it. In PWPSA, we modify original sample iteratively and use the position saliency as well as the packet score to determine insertion or replacement order at each step.

The vulnerability of DPI engine is that it relies heavily on pattern matching algorithms, which consume a lot of system resources. In order to make denial of service of DPI, the adversary leverages string repetitions to perform algorithmic complexity attacks. In this paper, we propose an attack identification method for automata and design three defensive strategies. Our attack identification method adopts a two-step threshold detection method, while defensive mechanisms include dropping, transferring and rescheduling the traffic. And the rescheduling traffic based on multi-core platform is a parallelization problem. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a traffic exchange strategy between threads, so that the attack traffic is allocated to dedicated threads. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by checking the packet loss rate of NIC and monitoring the utilization of CPU and memory. Upon different attack intensity, our experiments show a throughput boost of up to 11%-60% by comparing with the original system, and 4%-14% with the Level-1 threshold detection. In addition, the false negative rate under the diversified attack scenarios is lower than the original system and Level-1 threshold detection.","","978-1-7281-1141-4","10.1109/BDCloud.2018.00113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8672265","deep packet inspection;algorithmic complexity attack;DDos;task scheduling","Complexity theory;Pattern matching;Partitioning algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Engines;Computer crime;Parallel architectures","computer network security;pattern matching;telecommunication traffic","Level-1 threshold detection;diversified attack scenarios;algorithmic complexity attacks;DPI engine;security devices;pattern matching algorithms;attack identification method;two-step threshold detection method;rescheduling traffic;multicore platform;traffic exchange strategy;attack traffic;different attack intensity;deep packet inspection;denial of service;automata;parallelization problem;packet loss rate","","","","20","","21 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such complex relationships are results of physical constraints and domain norms which exist in many CPS domains. In this paper, we propose ABATe, an Automatic Behavioral Abstraction Technique based on Neural Networks for detecting anomalies in smart cyber-physical systems. Unlike traditional techniques which abstract the statistical properties of different sensor values, ABATe learns complex relationships between event vectors from normal operational data available in abundance with smart CPS and uses this abstracted model to detect anomalies. ABATe detected more than 88% of attacks in the publicly available SWaT dataset featuring data from a scaled down Sewage Water Treatment plant with a very low false positive rate of 1%.

In the course of experimental research, a recurrent neural network with one-dimensional convolutional layer was implemented. The Secure Water Treatment dataset was used to train model and assess its quality. The obtained results indicate the possibility of using the proposed method in practice.

One of commonest attack is known as black hole attack, which mostly targets the MANETs reactive routing protocols, such as AODV and DSR. Simulation scenarios of AODV and DSR based MANET were conducted using Network Simulator 2 (NS-2) and NS-3, while introducing the black hole attack in each of the scenarios, to analyse the protocols’ performances. The different scenarios are generated by changing the mobility (locations) of the nodes. The performance metrics that are used to do the analysis are throughput, end-to-end delay and packet delivery ratio. The simulation results showed that the performance of both AODV and DSR degrades in the presence of black hole attack. Throughput and packet delivery ratio decrease when the network is attacked by black hole, because the malicious node absorbs or discards some of the packets. End-to-end delay is also reduced in the presence of a black hole attack because a malicious node pretends to have a valid route to a destination without checking the routing table, and therefore shortens the route discovery process. The results also showed that throughput decreases slightly when mobility of the nodes is increased in the network. The increase in the speed of the nodes decreases both packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay. The closer the black hole node was to the source node requesting the transmission, the worse the impact. A focused analysis on AODV indicates that, even with the introduction of relatively few black hole nodes to the network, there still exist a potential to bring significant disruptions to communication.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2017.8531629","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531629","MANET security;reactive routing protocols;black hole attack;mobility","Routing protocols;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Security;Network topology;Topology","","","","2","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

In order to solve the problem above, this paper proposes an integrated intrusion detection model based on deep neural network. Furthermore, model integration solves the problem of sample imbalance and improves the generalization ability of the model. In this paper, we firstly use Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN) model to sample dataset. Then, multiple deep neural network (DNN) classifiers are established and special screening of the classifiers was carried out. Afterwards, all DNN classifiers were integrated based on AdaBoost integration algorithm. During the training of DNN classifiers, the training samples are sampled through an antagonistic generation network, which reduce the impact of data imbalance on classification performance of DNN classifiers. Finally, by conducting experiments with KDD 99 and NS-KDD data sets, the good stability and high accuracy of proposed model are verified.","","978-1-6654-2616-9","10.1109/ICCEA53728.2021.00037","Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9581127","Generative Adversarial Networks;Intrusion Detection;AdaBoost;Integration Method;Deep Neural Networks","Deep learning;Training;Neural networks;Intrusion detection;Training data;Network security;Data processing","","","","","","29","","28 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these issues, in this paper, we propose an IDS which reduces the amount of manual interaction and needed expert knowledge and is able to yield acceptable performance under zero-day attacks. Our approach is to use three learning techniques in parallel: gated recurrent unit (GRU), convolutional neural network as deep techniques and random forest as an ensemble technique. These systems are trained in parallel and the results are combined under two logics: majority vote and “OR” logic. We use the NSL-KDD dataset to verify the proficiency of our proposed system. Simulation results show that the system has the potential to operate with a very low technician interaction under the zero-day attacks.

We propose Moving Target Defense (MTD) mechanisms-which force an attacker to cope with frequent changes ongoing within the targeted network function to carry out a successful attack through the above-mentioned attack vectors. For algorithmic complexity DoS attacks, we show a mechanism that proactively and reactively switches between different implementations of the network function. Thus, eliminating the certainty of the attacker regarding the targeted implementation.

However, it has been shown that sensors and wireless channels are vulnerable to security attacks, and attackers can modify data sensed from sensors or received from other vehicles. To address this problem, in this paper, we design three types of stealthy attacks on ACC or CACC inputs, where the stealthy attacks can deceive a rule-based detection approach and impede system properties (collision-freeness and vehicle-following distance). We then develop two deep-learning models, a predictor-based model and an encoder-decoder- based model to detect the attacks, where the two models do not need attacker models for training.

How to detect security threats and measure the security of the Internet arises a significant research topic. For detecting the Internet attacks and measuring its security, collecting different categories of data and employing methods of data analytics are essential. However, the literature still lacks a thorough review on security-related data collection and analytics on the Internet. Therefore, it becomes a necessity to review the current state of the art in order to gain a deep insight on what categories of data should be collected and which methods should be used to detect the Internet attacks and to measure its security. In this paper, we survey existing studies about security-related data collection and analytics for the purpose of measuring the Internet security. We first divide the data related to network security measurement into four categories: 1) packet-level data; 2) flow-level data; 3) connection-level data; and 4) host-level data. For each category of data, we provide a specific classification and discuss its advantages and disadvantages with regard to the Internet security threat detection. We also propose several additional requirements for security-related data analytics in order to make the analytics flexible and scalable. Based on the usage of data categories and the types of data analytic methods, we review current detection methods for distributed denial of service flooding and worm attacks by applying the proposed requirements to evaluate their performance.

One major challenge in the implementation of these techniques is the available training data for each new potential attack category. In this paper, we propose a new model for secure network based on machine learning algorithms. The proposed model ensures better learning of minority classes using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture. In particular, the new model optimizes the GAN parameter including the number of inner learning steps for the discriminator to balance the training datasets. Then, the optimized GAN generates highly informative “like real” instances to be appended to the original data which improve the detection of the classes with relatively small training data. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach enhances the overall classification performance and detection accuracy even for the rarely detectable classes for both UNSW and NSL-KDD datasets.

Unfortunately, this system has been exploited by cybercriminals to disseminate malware to an enormous number of end-users and their vulnerable machines. To protect their malicious ads and malware from detection by the ad network, malvertisers apply a variety of evasion techniques such as fingerprinting the execution environment, redirecting to compromised IP addresses, and malware polymorphism. On the other hand, the ad network can also apply inspection techniques to spoil the malvertiser's tricks and expose the malware. However, both the malvertiser and the ad network are under the constraints of resource and time. In this paper, we aim to apply game theory to formulate the problem of inspecting the malware inserted by the malvertisers into the Web-based advertising system. We design a normal form game between the malvertiser and the ad network, define their strategies and payoff functions, and compute their pure-strategy and mixed-strategy Nash equilibria.

Avoiding an infection in the first place is a hard task, as computer systems are often vulnerable to a multitude of attacks. However, to explore and control an infected system, an attacker needs to establish a communication channel with the victim. While such a channel can be easily established to an unprotected end host in the Internet, infiltrating a closed network usually requires passing an application-level gateway -- in most cases a web proxy -- which constitutes an ideal spot for detecting and blocking unusual outbound communication. This papers introduces DUMONT, a system for detecting covert outbound HTTP communication passing through a web proxy. DUMONT learns profiles of normal HTTP requests for each user of the proxy and adapts to individual web surfing characteristics. The profiles are inferred from a diverse set of features, covering the structure and content of outbound data, and allowing for automatically identifying tunnels and covert channels as deviations from normality. While this approach does not generally rule out sophisticated covert communication, it significantly improves on state-of-the-art methods and hardens networks against malware proliferation. This capability is demonstrated in an evaluation with 90 days of web traffic, where DUMONT uncovers the communication of malware, tunnels and backdoors with few false alarms.","","978-0-7695-4762-6","10.1109/EC2ND.2011.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6377758","Network Security;Anomaly Detection;Machine Learning;Covert Channels;Malicious Software","Detectors;Software;Feature extraction;Training;Malware;Entropy;Support vector machines","computer network security;internetworking;invasive software;telecommunication channels;transport protocols;Web services","HTTP request;adaptive covert communication detection;computer system;malicious software;computer security;infected system;communication channel;Internet;application level gateway;unusual outbound communication;DUMONT;Web proxy;Web surfing characteristics;automatically tunnel identification;covert channel;malware;attack vulnerability","","8","","29","","13 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We investigate the impact of reckless, random, and opportunistic attacker behaviors (modes which many historical cyber attacks have used) on the effectiveness of our behavior rule-based UAV IDS (BRUIDS) which bases its audit on behavior rules to quickly assess the survivability of the UAV facing malicious attacks. Through a comparative analysis with the multiagent system/ant-colony clustering model, we demonstrate a high detection accuracy of BRUIDS for compliant performance.

Causative attacks, in principle, target decision-making algorithms (e.g., inference and learning algorithms) to alter their decisions by making them oblivious to specific attacks. Such attacks influence inference algorithms by tampering with the mechanism through which the algorithm is provided with the statistical model of the population about which an inferential decision is made. Causative attacks are viable, for instance, by contaminating the historical or training data, or by compromising an expert who provides the model. In the presence of causative attacks, the inference algorithms operate under a distorted statistical model for the population from which they collect data samples. This paper introduces specific notions of secure estimation and provides a framework under which secure estimation under causative attacks can be formulated. Closed-form decision rules, and the fundamental tradeoffs between security guarantee and decision qualities are characterized. To circumvent the computational complexity associated with growing parameter dimension or attack complexity, a scalable estimation algorithm and its attendant optimality guarantees are provided.","2157-8117","978-1-5386-9291-2","10.1109/ISIT.2019.8849831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8849831","","Data models;Inference algorithms;Estimation;Parameter estimation;Complexity theory;Probability density function;Decision making","computational complexity;decision making;decision theory;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);parameter estimation;security of data;statistical analysis","causative attacks;decision-making algorithms;learning algorithms;secure parameter estimation;inference algorithms;closed-form decision rules;distorted statistical model;computational complexity","","1","","14","","26 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a network intrusion detection model based on a convolutional neural network-IDS (CNN-IDS). Redundant and irrelevant features in the network traffic data are first removed using different dimensionality reduction methods. Features of the dimensionality reduction data are automatically extracted using the CNN, and more effective information for identifying intrusion is extracted by supervised learning. To reduce the computational cost, we convert the original traffic vector format into an image format and use a standard KDD-CUP99 dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed CNN model. The experimental results indicate that the AC, FAR, and timeliness of the CNN-IDS model are higher than those of traditional algorithms.

Inspired by the idea of moving target defense technologies, CANeleon equips each legitimate CAN node with the ability to shift the spoofed frame ID. In this way, the IDs of malicious frames are exposed and can be further filtered by legitimate nodes. Moreover, CANeleon neither inserts new information to the frame, nor requires any modification to the CAN protocol, so it is in compliance with the existing standards.

It is important to organize this knowledge to better understand the botnet problem and its solution space. In this paper, we structure existing botnet literature into three comprehensive taxonomies of botnet behavioral features, detection and defenses. This elevated view highlights opportunities for network defense by revealing shortcomings in existing approaches. We introduce the notion of a dimension to denote different criteria which can be used to classify botnet detection techniques. We demonstrate that classification by dimensions is particularly useful for evaluating botnet detection mechanisms through various metrics of interest. We also show how botnet behavioral features from the first taxonomy affect the accuracy of the detection approaches in the second taxonomy. This information can be used to devise integrated detection strategies by combining complementary approaches. To provide real-world context, we liberally augment our discussions with relevant examples from security research and products.","1553-877X","","10.1109/SURV.2013.091213.00134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6616686","bot;botnet;botmaster;C&C;DNS flux;IP flux;spambot;stepping-stone;cyberwarfare;DDoS;spam;cyberfraud;fast flux service network;bot family;complex event processing","Servers;Taxonomy;Protocols;IP networks;Malware;Electronic mail;Social network services","computer network security;invasive software","botnet behavior taxonomy;botnet phenomenon;network defense mechanism;botnet detection technique;pattern classification;integrated detection strategy;complementary approach;security","","97","","162","","2 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"ZOE: Content-Based Anomaly Detection for Industrial Control Systems","C. Wressnegger; A. Kellner; K. Rieck",NA; NA; NA,"2018 48th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN)","23 Jul 2018","2018","","","127","138","Due its complexity and a multitude of proprietary components, industrial control systems are an immanently difficult field of application for intrusion detection. Proprietary binary protocols and the lack of public specifications have forced the research community to move away from content-based detection to more abstract concepts. In this paper, we show that in contrast to prior belief the content of unknown binary protocols can very well be modeled. ZOE derives prototype models that are specific to individual types of messages in order to capture the characteristics of arbitrary binary protocols and enable detecting different forms of attacks as anomalies. In an evaluation based on 6 days of network traffic recorded at a large power plant (1,900 MW) with over 92,000 unique devices, we demonstrate that ZOE improves upon related approaches by up to an order of magnitude in detection performance, but also significantly decreases false positives.","2158-3927","978-1-5386-5596-2","10.1109/DSN.2018.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8416477","Industrial networks;SCADA;Anomaly Detection","Protocols;Prototypes;Anomaly detection;Data models;Detectors;Intrusion detection","computer network security;industrial control;Internet;invasive software;protocols;telecommunication traffic","proprietary binary protocols;public specifications;research community;content-based detection;unknown binary protocols;ZOE;prototype models;arbitrary binary protocols;detection performance;anomaly detection;industrial control systems;proprietary components;intrusion detection","","4","","73","","23 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
