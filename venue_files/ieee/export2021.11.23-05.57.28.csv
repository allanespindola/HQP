Besides being harder to take down, modern botnets tend to be stealthier in the way they perform malicious activities, making current detection approaches, including, ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel botnet detection system that is able to identify stealthy P2P botnets, even when malicious activities may not be observable. First, our system identifies all hosts that are likely engaged in P2P communications. Then, we derive statistical fingerprints to profile different types of P2P traffic, and we leverage these fingerprints to distinguish between P2P botnet traffic and other legitimate P2P traffic. Unlike previous work, our system is able to detect stealthy P2P botnets even when the underlying compromised hosts are running legitimate P2P applications (e.g., Skype) and the P2P bot software at the same time. Our experimental evaluation based on real-world data shows that the proposed system can achieve high detection accuracy with a low false positive rate.","2158-3927","978-1-4244-9233-6","10.1109/DSN.2011.5958212","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5958212","Botnet;P2P;Intrusion Detection;Security","Peer to peer computing;Monitoring;Protocols;Clustering algorithms;IP networks;Storms;Electronic mail","computer network security;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic","stealthy P2P botnet detection;statistical traffic fingerprints;peer-to-peer botnets;P2P botnet traffic","","50","1","23","","18 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When initiating traffic, users are required to install flow rules that direct the traffic routing. This process requires communication between control and data plane and results in significant overhead and enables the controller to monitor the traffic and its source. In this paper, we introduce a novel misbehavior, called freeloading, where attackers bypass the process of installing flow rules. The attackers thus can send traffic with an unfair advantage in delay (enabling them to launch more timely threats) and significantly reduce the risk of attacker detection by the network controller (especially if further threats were launched). To prevent such attack, we develop a flow watermarking technique that embeds a secret message into the data payload. It facilitates ownership of the established flow rules, so that only the legitimate owners of flow rules can send packets using their own rules and the network can help detect the misuse cases of the installed flow rules.","","978-1-4673-8579-4","10.1109/ICCNC.2016.7440628","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7440628","Software-defined networking;OpenFlow;Open Vswtich;Network-based attacks","Watermarking;Payloads;Encoding;Decoding;Process control;IP networks;Protocols","computer network security;software defined networking;telecommunication network routing","freeloader misbehavior detection;software-defined networking;SDN;traffic routing;attacker detection;network controller","","8","","34","","24 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we present MADAM, a novel host-based malware detection system for Android devices which simultaneously analyzes and correlates features at four levels: kernel, application, user and package, to detect and stop malicious behaviors. MADAM has been specifically designed to take into account those behaviors that are characteristics of almost every real malware which can be found in the wild. MADAM detects and effectively blocks more than 96 percent of malicious apps, which come from three large datasets with about 2,800 apps, by exploiting the cooperation of two parallel classifiers and a behavioral signature-based detector.

They are becoming ubiquitous and have been widely used to transfer critical information, such as banking accounts, credit cards, e-mails, and social network credentials. The more pervasive the wireless technology is going to be, the more important its security issue will be. Whereas the current security protocols for wireless networks have addressed the privacy and confidentiality issues, there are unaddressed vulnerabilities threatening their availability and integrity (e.g., denial of service, session hijacking, and MAC address spoofing attacks). In this paper, we describe an anomaly based intrusion detection system for the IEEE 802.11 wireless networks based on behavioral analysis to detect deviations from normal behaviors that are triggered by wireless network attacks. Our anomaly behavior analysis of the 802.11 protocols is based on monitoring the n-consecutive transitions of the protocol state machine. We apply sequential machine learning techniques to model the n-transition patterns in the protocol and characterize the probabilities of these transitions being normal. We have implemented several experiments to evaluate our system performance. By cross validating the system over two different wireless channels, we have achieved a low false alarm rate (<;0.1%). We have also evaluated our approach against an attack library of known wireless attacks and has achieved more than 99% detection rate.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2433898","AFOSR DDDAS(grant numbers:FA95550-12-1-0241); National Science Foundation research projects(grant numbers:NSF IIP-0758579,NCS-0855087,IIP-1127873); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7109166","Anomaly detection;IEEE 802.11 security;Intrusion detection;Wireless Network security;Protocol analysis;Wireless networks;Anomaly detection;IEEE 802.11 security;intrusion detection;wireless network security;protocol analysis;wireless networks","Protocols;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Intrusion detection;Detectors;Communication system security;Wireless networks","learning (artificial intelligence);probability;security of data;wireless channels;wireless LAN","wireless anomaly detection;IEEE 802.11 behavior analysis;wireless communication network;wireless technology;security protocol;intrusion detection system;sequential machine learning technique;n-transition pattern;transitions probability;wireless channel;wireless attack","","38","","27","IEEE","15 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to continue their malevolent activities without being detected, cyber criminals make efforts to conceal the core servers (e.g., C&C servers, exploit servers, and drop-zone servers) in the malicious web infrastructure. Such deliberate invisibility of those concealed malicious servers, however, makes them particularly distinguishable from benign web servers that are usually promoted to be public. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale measurement study to investigate the visibility of both malicious and benign servers. From our intensive analysis of over 100,000 benign servers, 45,000 malicious servers and 40,000 redirections, we identify a set of distinct features of malicious web infrastructures from their locations, structures, roles, and relationships perspectives, and propose a lightweight yet effective detection system called VisHunter. VisHunter identifies malicious redirections from visible servers to invisible servers at the entryway of malicious web infrastructures. We evaluate VisHunter on both online public data and large-scale enterprise network traffic, and demonstrate that VisHunter can achieve an average 96.2% detection rate with only 0.9% false positive rate on the real enterprise network traffic.","","978-1-4673-9953-1","10.1109/INFOCOM.2016.7524582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7524582","","Search engines;Superluminescent diodes;Feature extraction;Web servers;Malware;Indexes","computer crime;Internet","invisibility;malicious Web infrastructures;server visibility analysis;cyber criminals;malicious activities;core servers;benign Web servers;VisHunter;online public data;real enterprise network traffic","","6","","33","","28 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The magnitude of such modifications is used to visualize the most relevant features that explain the reason for the misclassification. The presented methodology generated satisfactory explanations that describe the reasoning behind the mis-classifications, with descriptions that match expert knowledge.

This paper aims to resolve issues of limited quantity and quality of training data sets and investigates the impact of features selection process on the classification performance. It introduces a novel framework to extract efficient real ‚Äúground-truth‚Äù training data sets from the network traffic for supervised machine learning algorithms. We support this claim by performing the evaluation of results on a Naive Bayesian classifier.","","978-1-4673-8386-8","10.1109/NOF.2015.7333298","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7333298","Attack Detection;machine learning;Security rules;Pattern-Matching","Training data;Training;Intrusion detection;Engines;Pattern matching;Bayes methods;Accuracy","Bayes methods;computer network security;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","training data extraction framework;security services;NIDS;network intrusion detection system;security issues;detection engines;malicious traffic inspection;misuse detection;anomaly detection;machine learning approach;anomaly detection systems;operational settings;random feature selection;ground-truth training data sets;supervised machine learning algorithms;Naive Bayesian classifier","","","","19","","23 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, new mobile malware is emerging daily that introduces new security risks. However, while existing security solutions generally protect mobile devices against known risks, they are vulnerable to as yet unknown risks. How anti-malware software reacts to new, unknown malicious software is generally difficult to predict. Therefore, anti-malware software is in continuous development in order to be able to detect new malware or new variants of existing malware. Similarly, as long as anti-malware software develops, malware writers also develop their malicious code by using various evasion strategies, such as obfuscation and encryption. This is the lifecycle of malicious and anti-malware software. In this paper, the use of evolutionary computation techniques are investigated, both for developing new variants of mobile malware which successfully evades anti-malware systems based on static analysis and for developing better security solutions against them automatically. A coevolutionary arms race mechanism has always been considered a potential candidate for developing a more robust system against new attacks and for system testing. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first application of coevolutionary computation to address this problem.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2018.2824250","Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey(grant numbers:TUBITAK-112E354); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8332973","Mobile malware;automatic malware generation;static analysis;evasion;obfuscation;malware detection;evolutionary computation;coevolution;Android","Malware;Security;Static analysis;Androids;Humanoid robots;Mobile handsets","evolutionary computation;invasive software;mobile computing","security solutions;mobile malware;malware writers;anti-malware systems;security risks;anti-malware software;malicious software;coevolutionary computation;coevolutionary arms race mechanis;computer security","","9","","52","IEEE","6 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A data guard is a common cross-domain sharing solution that inspects the security labels of exported data objects and validates that they are such that they can be released according to policy. While we see that guard solutions can be implemented with high assurance, we find that obtaining an equivalent level of assurance in the correctness of the security labels easily becomes a hard problem in practical scenarios. Thus, a weakness of the guard-based solution is that there is often limited assurance in the correctness of the security labels. To mitigate this, guards make use of content checkers such as dirty word lists as a means of detecting mislabeled data. To improve the overall security of such cross-domain solutions, we investigate more advanced content checkers based on the use of machine learning. Instead of relying on manually specified dirty word lists, we can build data-driven methods that automatically infer the words associated with classified content. However, care must be taken when constructing and deploying these methods as naive implementations are vulnerable to manipulation attacks. In order to provide a better context for performing classification, we monitor the incoming information flow and use the audit trail to construct controlled environments. The usefulness of this deployment scheme is demonstrated using a real collection of classified and unclassified documents.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2017.1700235","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8067681","","Military communication;Information exchange;Access control;Sensitivity;Malware;Security","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","data leakage prevention;data guard;common cross-domain sharing solution;exported data objects;guard-based solution;mislabeled data;advanced content checkers;manually specified dirty word lists;cross-domain information exchange security","","2","","15","","13 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Recent studies show that deep learning-based methods are effective for network intrusion detection due to the ability to learn discriminative features from data automatically. However, these models ignore the problem of the irregular time intervals between packets in a flow, causing the degradation of detection performance. To this end, we propose a Spatial and Temporal Aware Intrusion Detection model (STIDM). The proposed STIDM model first uses a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) to extract spatial features based on the nature of flow and packet. Then we design a Time and Length sensitive LSTM (TL-LSTM) method to learn richer temporal features from the irregular flows. The two parts are trained simultaneously to achieve global optimum. Through extensive experiments on the ISCX2012 dataset and the CICIDS2017 dataset, we demonstrate that STIDM outperforms state-of-the-art models.","2324-9013","978-1-6654-0392-4","10.1109/TrustCom50675.2020.00058","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019QY1300,2018YFB0803602); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9342991","intrusion detection;convolutional neural network;long short-term memory;time irregularity;feature extraction","Privacy;Computational modeling;Network intrusion detection;Manuals;Feature extraction;Security;Payloads","data analysis;data visualisation;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data","Spatial Temporal Aware Intrusion Detection model;network intrusion detection;existing conventional detection methods;manually-designed features;intrusion behaviours;large-scale flow data;deep learning-based methods;detection performance;STIDM model;spatial features;richer temporal features","","","","27","","9 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, we propose a cloud-based deception framework which aims to confuse the attacker with reconnaissance replies while allowing legitimate uses. The deception is based on for-warding the reconnaissance packets to a cloud infrastructure through tunneling and SDN so that the returned IP addresses to the attacker will not be genuine. For handling legitimate requests, we create a reflected virtual topology in the cloud to match any changes in the original physical network to the cloud topology using SDN.

Here, we design and analyze a lightweight path-quality monitoring protocol that reliably raises an alarm when the packet-loss rate exceed a threshold, even when an adversary tries to bias monitoring results by selectively delaying, dropping, modifying, injecting, or preferentially treating packets. Our protocol is based on sublinear algorithms for sketching the second moment of stream of items and can monitor billions of packets using only 250-600 B of storage and the periodic transmission of a comparably sized IP packet. We also show how this protocol can be used to construct a more sophisticated protocol that allows the sender to localize the link responsible for the dropped packets. We prove that our protocols satisfy a precise definition of security, analyze their performance using numerical experiments, and derive analytic expressions for the tradeoff between statistical accuracy and system overhead.

To this end we propose a framework for automatic attack path identification in computer networks (APIN) by leveraging observable malicious behaviors to quantify the threat score of a set of attacks. Using two academic datasets, experimental results show that APIN is able to quickly reconstruct paths that offer meaningful insight into the nature of multi-step threats on the network, given only reasonable restrictions on network size and structure. These insights would not be possible with only existing tools, such as IDSs, and human analysts would require significant time and expertise to obtain the same findings without APIN's guidance.","","978-1-7281-8800-3","10.1109/ISI49825.2020.9280547","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9280547","Attack Path;Threat Score;Alert Prioritization;Intrusion Detection;Cyber Attack;Incident Response","Measurement;Computational modeling;Tools;Computer networks;Security;Informatics;Immune system","computer network security","automatic attack path identification;computer networks;network attack;multistep threats;network size;APIN guidance","","","","44","","8 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thereby, it improves not only privacy but is also efficient as it uses the computation power and data of potentially millions of clients for training in parallel. However, FL is vulnerable to so-called inference attacks by malicious aggregators which can infer information about clients‚Äô data from their model updates. Secure aggregation restricts the central aggregator to only learn the summation or average of the updates of clients. Unfortunately, existing protocols for secure aggregation for FL suffer from high communication, computation, and many communication rounds.In this work, we present SAFELearn, a generic design for efficient private FL systems that protects against inference attacks that have to analyze individual clients‚Äô model updates using secure aggregation. It is flexibly adaptable to the efficiency and security requirements of various FL applications and can be instantiated with MPC or FHE. In contrast to previous works, we only need 2 rounds of communication in each training iteration, do not use any expensive cryptographic primitives on clients, tolerate dropouts, and do not rely on a trusted third party. We implement and benchmark an instantiation of our generic design with secure two-party computation. Our implementation aggregates 500 models with more than 300K parameters in less than 0.5 seconds.","","978-1-6654-3732-5","10.1109/SPW53761.2021.00017","European Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9474309","Federated Learning;Inference Attacks;Secure Computation;Data Privacy","Training;Privacy;Data privacy;Computational modeling;Training data;Machine learning;Collaborative work","computer network security;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);protocols","secure aggregation;private FEderated learning;distributed machine learning paradigm;critical data privacy issues;aggregation server;inference attacks;malicious aggregators;central aggregator;SAFELearn;private FL systems","","","","53","","8 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we study and evaluate a poisoning attack in federated learning system based on generative adversarial nets (GAN). That is, an attacker first acts as a benign participant and stealthily trains a GAN to mimic prototypical samples of the other participants' training set which does not belong to the attacker. Then these generated samples will be fully controlled by the attacker to generate the poisoning updates, and the global model will be compromised by the attacker with uploading the scaled poisoning updates to the server.

To cope with this, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are considered mandatory for the protection of critical infrastructure. Furthermore, research is currently focusing on collaborative architectures for IDSs, creating a Collaborative IDS (CIDS). In such a system a number of IDS monitors work together towards creating a holistic picture of the monitored network. Nevertheless, a class of attacks exists, called probe-response, which can assist adversaries to detect the network position of CIDS monitors. This can significantly affect the advantages of a CIDS. In this paper, we introduce PREPARE, a framework for deploying probe-response attacks and also for studying methods for their mitigation. Moreover, we present significant improvements on both the effectiveness of probe-response attacks as well as on mitigation techniques for detecting them. We evaluate our approach via an extensive simulation and a real-world attack deployment that targets two CIDSs.

The ease with which copious volumes of operational data can be collected from such systems has produced a strong interest in the use of machine learning (ML) for cyber-security, provided that ML can itself be made sufficiently immune to attack. Adversarial learning (AL) is the domain focusing on such issues and an arising AL theme is the need to ensure that ML solutions make use of robust input measurement features (i.e., the data sets used for ML training must themselves be robust against adversarial influences). This observation leads to further open questions, including: ‚ÄúWhat formally denotes sufficient robustness?‚Äù, ‚ÄúMust robust features necessarily exist for all IT systems?‚Äù, ‚ÄúDo robust features necessarily provide complete coverage of the attack space?‚Äù, etc. This work shows that these (and other) open AL questions can be usefully re-cast in terms of the classical dynamical system's problem of needing to focus analyses on a system's invariant measures. This re-casting is useful as a large body of mature dynamical systems theory exists concerning invariant measures which can then be applied to cyber-security.

The new breed of cyberattacks are decidedly systemic, affecting more than a single node or a single point of failure, to better hide and time-integrate its malicious programming. Current modes of intrusion detection and correction in an industrial setting are based on a statistical process control scheme that unfolded in the mid-Twentieth Century and which, while still effective for diagnosing pronounced, single-node malicious behavior, is ill-suited for the properties of modern, sophisticated cyberattacks. We propose a novel approach, based on deep reinforcement learning, that treats malicious behavior as a process variation and corrects for it by actively tuning the operating parameters of the system. In this way, it can be layered atop, and functionally complement, standard statistical process control. We describe our approach in the additive manufacturing setting of 3D printing and explain how it can scale to large systems composed of many nodes in a complex topology.

However, SNNs work very different than conventional neural network architectures. Consequently, applying SNNs in the field might introduce new unexpected security vulnerabilities. This paper explores and identifies potential sources of information leakage for the Izhikevich neuron, which is a popular neuron model used in digital implementations of SNNs.

However, some recent literature have addressed various challenges (such as complex networking, persistent storage facilities, cross data centers and multicloud supports, security issues, and lack of available, capable container management APIs, etc.) regarding successful container adoption in industries, which might have resulted in a seemingly meager increase in industrial deployments of containerization over the past few years despite bestowing efficient lightweight virtualization. Moreover, a comprehensive overview of containerizations along with their popularity dynamics has still not been found in contemporary literature, which further extends knowledge gap between developers and available technologies. Hence, current study touches upon different technicalities involved in containerization with potential problems and possible solutions along with various important industrial applications to manifest its existing supports and technical hardships.

Traditional machine learning methods have been frequently used in the context of network security. However, such methods are more based on statistical features extracted from sources such as binaries, emails, and packet flows. On the other hand, recent years witnessed a phenomenal growth in computer vision mainly driven by the advances in the area of convolutional neural networks. At a glance, it is not trivial to see how computer vision methods are related to network security. Nonetheless, there is a significant amount of work that highlighted how methods from computer vision can be applied in network security for detecting attacks or building security solutions.

Under normal operating conditions, the CSOC locations are ideally staffed such that the alerts generated from the sensors in a work-shift are thoroughly investigated by the scheduled analysts in a timely manner. Unfortunately, when adverse events such as increase in alert arrival rates or alert investigation rates occur, alerts have to wait for a longer duration for analyst investigation, which poses a direct risk to organizations. Hence, our research objective is to mitigate the impact of the adverse events by dynamically and autonomously re-allocating alerts to other location(s) such that the performances of all the CSOC locations remain balanced. This is achieved through the development of a novel centralized adaptive decision support system whose task is to re-allocate alerts from the affected locations to other locations. This re-allocation decision is non-trivial because the following must be determined: (1) timing of a re-allocation decision, (2) number of alerts to be reallocated, and (3) selection of the locations to which the alerts must be distributed. The centralized decision-maker (henceforth referred to as agent) continuously monitors and controls the level of operational effectiveness-LOE (a quantified performance metric) of all the locations. The agent's decision-making framework is based on the principles of stochastic dynamic programming and is solved using reinforcement learning (RL). In the experiments, the RL approach is compared with both rule-based and load balancing strategies. By simulating real-world scenarios, learning the best decisions for the agent, and applying the decisions on sample realizations of the CSOC's daily operation, the results show that the RL agent outperforms both approaches by generating (near-) optimal decisions that maintain a balanced LOE among the CSOC locations. Furthermore, the scalability experiments highlight the practicality of adapting the method to a large number of CSOC locations.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2019.2927977","Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-13-1-0421,W911NF-15-1-0576); Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-15-1-2007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8762232","Distributed cybersecurity operations center (CSOC);centralized alert management;level of operational effectiveness;reinforcement learning;adaptive resource allocation","Measurement;Organizations;Computer security;Monitoring;Sensors;Reinforcement learning;Decision making","decision making;decision support systems;dynamic programming;learning (artificial intelligence);resource allocation;scheduling;security of data;stochastic processes","CSOC locations;adaptive decision support system;affected locations;re-allocation decision;centralized decision-maker;reinforcement learning;CSOC's daily operation;optimal decisions;adaptive alert management;balancing optimal performance;distributed CSOCs;Cybersecurity Operations Centers;cybersecurity analyst workforce;normal operating conditions;alert arrival rates;alert investigation rates","","","","41","IEEE","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Stealth malware in particular poses an increased threat because it is specifically designed to evade detection mechanisms, spreading dormant, in the wild for extended periods of time, gathering sensitive information or positioning itself for a high-impact zero-day attack. Policing the growing attack surface requires the development of efficient anti-malware solutions with improved generalization to detect novel types of malware and resolve these occurrences with as little burden on human experts as possible. In this paper, we survey malicious stealth technologies as well as existing solutions for detecting and categorizing these countermeasures autonomously. While machine learning offers promising potential for increasingly autonomous solutions with improved generalization to new malware types, both at the network level and at the host level, our findings suggest that several flawed assumptions inherent to most recognition algorithms prevent a direct mapping between the stealth malware recognition problem and a machine learning solution. The most notable of these flawed assumptions is the closed world assumption: that no sample belonging to a class outside of a static training set will appear at query time. We present a formalized adaptive open world framework for stealth malware recognition and relate it mathematically to research from other machine learning domains.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2016.2636078","National Science Foundation, NSF(grant numbers:IIS-1320956); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7778160","Stealth;malware;rootkits;intrusion detection;machine learning;open set;recognition;anomaly detection;outlier detection;extreme value theory;novelty detection","Malware;Tutorials;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Command and control systems;Machine learning algorithms","invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence)","stealth malware attacks;autonomous open world solutions;high-impact zero-day attack;antimalware solutions;malicious stealth technologies;machine learning;stealth malware recognition problem;closed world assumption;formalized adaptive open world framework","","53","","174","IEEE","8 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional security approaches are insufficient and inefficient to address security threats in cloud-based IoT networks. In this vein, software defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), and machine learning techniques introduce numerous advantages that can effectively resolve cybersecurity matters for cloud-based IoT systems. In this paper, we propose a collaborative and intelligent network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) architecture, namely SeArch for SDN-based cloud IoT networks. It composes a hierarchical layer of intelligent IDS nodes working in collaboration to detect anomalies and formulate policy into the SDN-based IoT gateway devices to stop malicious traffic as fast as possible. We first describe a new NIDS architecture with a comprehensive analysis in terms of the system resource and path selection optimizations. Next, the system process logic is extensively investigated through main consecutive procedures, including initialization, runtime operation, and database update. Afterward, we conduct a detailed implementation of the proposed solution in an SDN-based environment and perform a variety of experiments.

With secret exploration and analysis of a target ICS, highly-skilled attackers can gain enough key knowledge about the system (e.g., the physical model of the system and the corresponding detection threshold), and then launch stealthy attacks by keeping the detection indicator under its threshold, thus bypasses existing intrusion detection mechanisms. However, we discover that all devices in industrial control systems consume energy at run time and the energy consumption varies according to different operation types and system states. Therefore, there exists relationships between control operation, system state and energy consumption of the device. Accordingly, we put forward a novel ICS intrusion detection approach based on multi-dimensional data fusion. This approach collects information about power consumption of physical devices, control operation and system state, and then identifies stealthy attacks by feeding the multi-dimensional information into a cascade detection algorithm.

In recent years, numerous enterprises have acknowledged the benefits of cloud-based service models. However, the security issues are a major concern, such as stealthy malware attacks against virtual domains. In this article, we propose an introspection based security approach, called VMShield for securing virtual domains in a cloud based service platform, which is designed to detect malware in cloud infrastructure. VMShield performs virtual memory introspection from the hypervisor (trusted-domain) to collect the run-time behavior of processes, making it impossible for the malware to evade the security tool. The use of introspection makes the proposed approach a better choice over traditional static and dynamic state-of-the-art techniques which fail to detect stealthy attacks. The VMShield extracts the system call features using Bag of n-gram approach and selects important features using the meta-heuristic algorithm, binary particle swarm optimization. Random Forest (RF) classifier is used to classify the monitored programs into benign and malign processes, making it capable of detecting the variants of malware thus, an advantage over the typical signature-matching approach. The University of New Mexico (UNM) Dataset and Bare cloud Dataset (University of California) has been used for the demonstration and validation of VMShield. The results prove that VMShield achieves a higher attack detection rate and reduced storage compared to previously proposed techniques.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2020.3048791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9312437","Binary particle swarm optimization;cloud security;dynamic analysis;intrusion detection;machine learning;malware detection;meta-heuristics;VM introspection","Security;Cloud computing;Malware;Feature extraction;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Tools","cloud computing;invasive software;particle swarm optimisation;virtual machines","n-gram approach;Random Forest classifier;typical signature-matching approach;higher attack detection rate;memory introspection-based malware detection;cloud-based services;stealthy attacks;cloud service;next-generation industrial standard;enterprise industry;numerous enterprises;cloud-based service models;security issues;stealthy malware attacks;virtual domains;VMShield;cloud based service platform;cloud infrastructure;virtual memory introspection;security tool;system call features;introspection-based security approach","","","","32","IEEE","1 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To aid and/or complement such PHY and upper layer techniques, in this paper, we propose a PHY design that can detect and locate not only an active intruder but also a passive eavesdropper in the network. Our method can either be used as a stand-alone solution or together with existing techniques to achieve improved smart grid data security.

Such a detection method has been called spectral analysis, because it works with statistical distributions, such as bytes, instructions or system calls frequencies spectra. Most statistical classification algorithms can be described as graphical models, namely Bayesian networks. We will first present in this paper an approach of viral detection by means of spectral analysis based on Bayesian networks, through two basic examples of such learning models: naive Bayes and hidden Markov models.

In this work we show that using data mining techniques can help an adversarial user of the cloud determine the nature and characteristics of co-scheduled applications and negatively impact their performance through targeted contention injections. We design Bolt, a simple runtime that extracts the sensitivity of co-scheduled applications to various types of interference and uses this signal to determine the type of these applications by applying a set of data mining techniques. We validate the accuracy of Bolt on a 39-server cluster. Bolt correctly identifies the type and characteristics of 81 percent out of 108 victim applications, and constructs specialized contention signals that degrade their performance. We also use Bolt to find the most commonly-run applications on EC2.

Unfortunately, traditional MPC algorithms are inefficient in the presence of a large number of participants. Moreover, in the traditional setting, MPC is only concerned with privacy of the input values. However, there is often a need to preserve the privacy of individuals on the basis of the output of the computation. Techniques proposed by the Trusted Computing community have shown promise in the context of new secure, efficient large-scale applications.

However, in most non-cooperative SEI scenarios, supervised and semi-supervised learning approaches are often incompatible due to the lack of labeled datasets. To solve this challenge, an unsupervised SEI framework is proposed based on information maximized generative adversarial networks (InfoGANs) and radio frequency fingerprint embedding (RFFE). To enhance individual discriminability, a gray histogram is first constructed according to the bispectrum extracted from the received signal before being embedded into the proposed framework. In addition to the latent class input and the RFFE, the proposed InfoGAN incorporates a priori statistical characteristics of the wireless propagation channels in the form of a structured multimodal latent vector to further improve the GAN quality. The probabilistic distribution of the bispectrum is derived in closed-form and the convergence of the InfoGAN is analyzed to demonstrate the influence of the RFFE. Numerical results indicate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for unsupervised SEI applications, both in terms of evaluation score and classification accuracy.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2020.2978620","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61271272); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2018YFA0701603); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9025169","Specific emitter identification;generative adversarial network;unsupervised deep learning;radio frequency fingerprint;Nakagami-m","Gallium nitride;Feature extraction;Training;Wireless communication;Convergence;Mutual information;Generators","fingerprint identification;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;statistical analysis;wireless channels","unsupervised SEI framework;labeled datasets;semisupervised learning approaches;machine learning approaches;radio-frequency fingerprint embedded InfoGAN;unsupervised specific emitter identification method;unsupervised SEI applications;structured multimodal latent vector;wireless propagation channels;a priori statistical characteristics;latent class input;received signal;bispectrum;gray histogram;individual discriminability;RFFE;radio frequency fingerprint","","8","","50","IEEE","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the other hand, machine learning algorithms generally aim to achieve the highest overall accuracy without considering class imbalance. This leads to severe performance degradation of existing ML-based NTC schemes when facing imbalanced scenarios. In this paper, we design a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture to generate traffic samples, in which the addition of the classifier and the pretraining module makes the generation process more stable and effective. We propose an end-to-end framework for imbalanced traffic classification, named ITCGAN, which can generate traffic samples for minority classes to adaptively rebalance the original traffic and simultaneously train the optimal classifier. We evaluate its effectiveness on the public ISCXVPN2016 dataset based on the global metrics and individual metrics. The results show that our method performs well in imbalanced NTC tasks, fully alleviating the performance degradation (a 10.27-percentage-point improvement to the precision of the most minority class).

These ports are those often marked by firewall administrators as ‚Äúsafe‚Äù or those given a higher priority on quality of service systems. This problem has been effectively managed by implementing deep packet inspection techniques, giving the administrators a view into the underlying layer 7 protocol of each flow. The reliance on transit payload to be in plain text format in order to reliably match the underlying content has put this method of classification at a major disadvantage. The use of encryption by users to render the contents of a data packet opaque is, therefore, of major concern to network administrators who rely heavily on deep packet inspection. Without the ability to interrogate the underlying payload of traffic flows, a new method to identify this type of traffic needs to be discovered in order to retain control of the network. As an increasing number of users turn to IP tunneling to secure their data transfers, network service providers need to ensure their systems are ready to handle this type of traffic. A failure to do so would result in them facing the reality of a badly managed network. This paper highlights the challenges faced by network service providers in opaque traffic classification for both existing and future, next generation networks.

This can lead to a convergence of AI and DLT, which in the past, has paved the way for major innovations of other information technologies.

However, it has been observed that sometimes the auto-encoder are likely to reconstruct anomalies due to the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù generalization ability, resulting in the miss detection of anomalies. To mitigate this deficiency, scholars have proposed the memory-augmented deep auto-encoder method recently. However, more recent work on memory-augmented uses continuous memory representations or key-values pairs in memory for read/write without forgetting mechanism, and it is assumed that data such as early access to the network are normal data. To deal with those imperfectness, we present a VAE-based memory-augmented network with a trained memory network: MEMVAE, addressing scheme to provide a strong guarantee to detect anomalous. In particular, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells are employed as the encoder and decoder to capture latent temporal structure. We then train an external memory module that records common patterns of the prototype. In addition, we present a weighted regular score that simply updates our memory entries. Our detector reports a reconstruction probability as the anomaly score. Experimental results on tabular data and time series data show that MEMVAE demonstrates significant improvements and better performance.","","978-1-6654-3881-0","10.1109/CEI52496.2021.9574589","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9574589","Anomaly Detection;Variational auto-encoder;Memory Network","Training;Time series analysis;Memory management;Prototypes;Memory modules;Detectors;Logic gates","","","","","","21","","29 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Targeted malware is a recent type of threat, involving bespoke software that has been created to target a specific victim. It is considered a more dangerous threat than generic malware, because a targeted attack can cause more serious damage to the victim. Our work aims to automatically distinguish between the network activity generated by the two types of malware, which then allows samples of malware to be classified as being either targeted or generic. For a network administrator, such knowledge can be important because it assists to understand which threats require particular attention. Because a network administrator usually manages more than an alarm simultaneously, the aim of the work is particularly relevant. We set up a sandbox and infected virtual machines with malware, recording all resulting malware activity on the network. Using the network packets produced by the malware samples, we extract features to classify their behavior. Before performing classification, we carefully analyze the features and the dataset to study all their details and gain a deeper understanding of the malware under study. Our use of statistical classifiers is shown to give excellent results in some cases, where we achieved an accuracy of almost 96% in distinguishing between the two types of malware. We can conclude that the network behaviors of the two types of malicious code are very different.","","978-1-5090-0990-9","10.1109/ARES.2016.36","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7784624","Network Security;Malware;Targeted attacks;Random Forests;K-NN","Malware;Feature extraction;Ports (Computers);Cryptography;Virtual environments;IP networks","feature extraction;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;statistical analysis;virtual machines","network behavior pattern learning;targeted malware;commodity malware;statistical classification techniques;generic malware;targeted attack;sandbox;infected virtual machines;network packets;feature extraction;behavior classification;statistical classifiers;malicious code","","","","35","","15 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional detection techniques become less effective in identifying bots that communicate via a P2P structure. In this paper, we present PeerClean, a novel system that detects P2P botnets in real time using only high-level features extracted from C&C network flow traffic. PeerClean reliably distinguishes P2P bot-infected hosts from legitimate P2P hosts by jointly considering flow-level traffic statistics and network connection patterns. Instead of working on individual connections or hosts, PeerClean clusters hosts with similar flow traffic statistics into groups. It then extracts the collective and dynamic connection patterns of each group by leveraging a novel dynamic group behavior analysis. Comparing with the individual host-level connection patterns, the collective group patterns are more robust and differentiable. Multi-class classification models are then used to identify different types of bots based on the established patterns. To increase the detection probability, we further propose to train the model with average group behavior, but to explore the extreme group behavior for the detection. We evaluate PeerClean on real-world flow records from a campus network.

Due to scalability, the SMs are small-sized and low-cost devices having low computational capabilities. The algorithms that are designed to complete the security requirements of SMs should be lightweight. To address this issue, this paper proposes a lightweight security solution to address the man-in-the-middle attack, data tempering, and blockchain-based data provenance. Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is used to generate link fingerprints, which are used along with pseudo-random nonce to secure AMI. The proposed algorithm detects the involvement of adversarial node or meter tempering by computing other values along with 0 and 1 as the average of consecutive RSSI and difference between the RSSI of connected static SMs. Pearson correlation coefficient (œÅ) of 0.9102 is achieved when no adversarial node is present in between the connected SMs having mobility in one or both SMs. Negative or approximately equal to zero values of œÅ are computed when the adversary is present in the AMI or any of the SM in the AMI is forged. For blockchain-based data provenance, all the hash values of the packet header are 100% matched with the hash functions present at the data concentrator unit (DCU), which shows no adversary's involvement in AMI. For cases when the adversary is in the AMI, hash functions show no match with the hash values present at the DCU.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2925787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8750798","Advanced metering infrastructure;link fingerprints;light-weight;provenance;security;blockchain","Security;Blockchain;Protocols;Meters;Smart meters;Smart grids;Internet of Things","cryptocurrencies;cryptography;RSSI;smart meters;telecommunication security","advanced metering infrastructure;smart meters;AMI;lightweight security solution;data tempering;blockchain-based data provenance;received signal strength indicator;RSSI;meter tempering;data concentrator unit;connected static SM;DCU;cyber attacks;man-in-the-middle attack;Pearson correlation coefficient;hash functions","","9","","32","CCBY","28 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite its central importance, the CAN bus system does not support authentication and authorization mechanisms, i.e., CAN messages are broadcast without basic security features. As a result, it is easy for attackers to launch attacks at the CAN bus network system. Attackers can compromise the CAN bus system in several ways including Denial of Service (DoS), Fuzzing and Spoofing attacks. It is imperative to devise methodologies to protect modern cars against the aforementioned attacks. In this paper, we propose a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect and mitigate the CAN bus network attacks. We generate our own dataset by first extracting attack-free data from our experimental car and by injecting attacks into the latter and collecting the dataset. We use the dataset for testing and training our model. With our selected hyper-parameter values, our results demonstrate that our classifier is efficient in detecting the CAN bus network attacks, we achieved an overall detection accuracy of 99.995%.

This paper is concerned with the problem of designing a secure distributed control methodology that is capable of performing a secure consensus computation in a D-NCS in the presence of misbehaving nodes. We consider the case of formation control in a multi-robot system using the linear consensus algorithm, and we model the malicious attack as an exogenous input that compromises the behavior of a single robot in this multi-robot system. The proposed secure distributed control methodology includes four phases: (1) Detect the neighbors' misbehaviors relying only on each robot's local observations; (2) Adjust the consensus computation weights according to the neighbors' reputation values; (3) Identify and isolate the compromised robot; and (4) Update the reference state using the adjusted consensus computation weights to ensure the convergence of well-behaving robots.

Network intrusion detection system is a widely used and effective security means at present. In addition, with the development of machine learning technology, various intelligent intrusion detection algorithms also start to sprout. By flexibly combining these intelligent methods with intrusion detection technology, the comprehensive performance of intrusion detection can be improved, but the vulnerability of machine learning model in the adversarial environment can not be ignored. In this paper, we study the defense problem of network intrusion detection system against adversarial samples. More specifically, we design a defense algorithm for NIDS against adversarial samples by using bidirectional generative adversarial network.

In these scenarios, an attacker gains free energy by manipulating prosumers' consumption and demand. Precise and fast attack detection is needed to guarantee suitable countermeasures to prevent potential risks. We propose a novel instance-based machine learning (ML) classifier for detecting FDIAs.

This is particularly undesirable in prominent and high-profile criminal communities where entry costs are significant (either monetarily or for example for background checking or other trust-building mechanisms).

Therefore, in order to operate WSNs in a secure way, any kind of intrusions should be detected before attackers can harm the network (i.e., sensor nodes) and/or information destination (i.e., data sink or base station).

In recent years, adversarial example generation methods for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been published, demonstrating that RNN classifiers are also vulnerable to such attacks. In this paper, we present a novel defense method, referred to as sequence squeezing, aimed at making RNN variant (e.g., LSTM) classifiers more robust against such attacks. Our method differs from existing defense methods, which were designed only for non-sequence based models. We also implement three additional defense methods inspired by recently published CNN defense methods as baselines for our method.

Inspired by the successes of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for training deep models in semi-unsupervised setting, we have proposed an end-to-end deep architecture for IDS. The proposed architecture is composed of two deep networks, each of which trained by competing with each other to understand the underlying concept of the normal traffic class. The key idea of this paper is to compensate the lack of anomalous traffic by approximately obtain them from normal flows. In this case, our method is not biased towards the available intrusions in the training set leading to more accurate detection. The proposed method has been evaluated on NSL-KDD dataset.

The proposed architecture includes: (i) multi-radio access technology capabilities, with simultaneous 802.11p and LTE-Uu support; (ii) a MEC platform, where algorithms for detecting attacks are implemented; (iii) an intelligent On-Board Unit with anti-hacking features inside the vehicle; (iv) a Public Key Infrastructure that validates in real-time the integrity of vehicle's data transmissions. As an indicative application scenario, the interaction between the entities of the CARAMEL architecture is showcased in the case that the GPS locations used by vehicles are spoofed.","2575-4912","978-1-7281-4355-2","10.1109/EuCNC48522.2020.9200945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9200945","","Computer architecture;Europe;Computer security;Privacy;Safety;Servers","public key cryptography;radio access networks;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","CARAMEL project;secure architecture;cybersecurity threats;automated driving;smart charging;Electric Vehicles;roadside infrastructure;CARAMEL architecture;connected driving;autonomous driving;multiradio access technology capabilities;LTE-Uu support;Public Key Infrastructure","","","","14","","21 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A recent promising approach for dynamic key agreement between groups of nodes, Plug-and-Secure for CAN, has been demonstrated to be information theoretically secure based on the physical properties of the CAN bus. In this paper, we illustrate side-channel attacks on the scheme, leading to nearly-complete leakage of the derived secret key bits to an adversary that is capable of probing the CAN bus. We identify the fundamental network properties that lead to such attacks and propose ideas to minimize the information leakage at the hardware, controller and system levels.","","978-1-5386-7471-0","10.1109/AsianHOST.2018.8607166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8607166","","Protocols;Security;Transmitters;Automobiles;Automotive engineering;Timing;Logic gates","controller area networks;cryptographic protocols;public key cryptography;telecommunication security","promising approach;secret key bits;system levels;information leakage;fundamental network properties;nearly-complete leakage;side-channel attacks;CAN bus;physical properties;dynamic key agreement;automotive networks;efficient key management;automotive controller area networks;physical layer key agreement;probing attacks","","2","","16","","10 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
