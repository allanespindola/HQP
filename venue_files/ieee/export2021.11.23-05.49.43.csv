Facing challenges of the rapidly increasing amount of diverse network traffic, recent research has employed end-to-end deep learning-based intrusion detectors for automatic feature extraction and high detection accuracy. However, deep learning has been proved vulnerable to adversarial attacks that may cause misclassification by imposing imperceptible perturbation on input samples. Though such vulnerability is widely discussed in the image processing domain, very few studies have investigated its perniciousness against network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and proposed corresponding defense strategies. In this paper, we try to fill this gap by proposing Def-IDS, an ensemble defense mechanism specially designed for NIDS, against both known and unknown adversarial attacks. It is a two-module training framework that integrates multi-class generative adversarial networks and multi-source adversarial retraining to improve model robustness, while the detection accuracy on unperturbed samples is maintained. We evaluate the mechanism over CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset and compare its performance with the other three defense methods. The results demonstrate that Def-IDS is able to detect various adversarial attacks with better precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy.","2637-9430","978-1-6654-1278-0","10.1109/ICCCN52240.2021.9522215","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9522215","Network intrusion detection;adversarial attacks;deep learning","Training;Perturbation methods;Network intrusion detection;Detectors;Telecommunication traffic;Generative adversarial networks;Feature extraction","computer crime;computer network security;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;Internet of Things","ensemble defense mechanism;deep learning-based network intrusion detection;security breaches;diverse network traffic;end-to-end deep learning-based intrusion detectors;automatic feature extraction;NIDS;Def-IDS;adversarial attacks;CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset;Internet of Things systems;two-module training framework;multiclass generative adversarial networks;multisource adversarial retraining","","","","29","","31 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are important devices that can mitigate the threats by detecting malicious behaviors. Furthermore, the collaborations among vehicles in VANETs can improve the detection accuracy by communicating their experiences between nodes. To this end, distributed machine learning is a suitable framework for the design of scalable and implementable collaborative detection algorithms over VANETs. One fundamental barrier to collaborative learning is the privacy concern as nodes exchange data among them. A malicious node can obtain sensitive information of other nodes by inferring from the observed data. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving machine-learningbased collaborative IDS (PML-CIDS) for VANETs. The proposed algorithm employs the alternating direction method of multipliers to a class of empirical risk minimization problems and trains a classifier to detect the intrusions in the VANETs. We use the differential privacy to capture the privacy notation of the PML-CIDS and propose a method of dual-variable perturbation to provide dynamic differential privacy. We analyze theoretical performance and characterize the fundamental tradeoff between the security and privacy of the PML-CIDS. We also conduct numerical experiments using the network security laboratory-knowledge discovery and data mining (NSL-KDD) dataset to corroborate the results on the detection accuracy, security-privacy tradeoffs, and design.","2373-776X","","10.1109/TSIPN.2018.2801622","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1544782 and CNS-1720230); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8279495","ADMM;data processing;differential privacy;distributed computing;machine learning;network security;vehicle safety;vehicular ad hoc networks","Vehicular ad hoc networks;Privacy;Data privacy;Collaboration;Engines;Training data;Security","data mining;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","security-privacy tradeoffs;distributed privacy-preserving collaborative intrusion detection systems;VANET;vehicular ad hoc network;modern transportation systems;distributed machine learning;scalable detection algorithms;collaborative learning;privacy concern;privacy-preserving machine;collaborative IDS;PML-CIDS;privacy notation;dynamic differential privacy;collaborative detection algorithms;network security laboratory-knowledge discovery and data mining;NSL-KDD dataset","","33","","38","IEEE","2 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Among those attacks routing attack is the most severe one. To systematically cope up with this routing attack, Risk Aware Response Mechanism is used. In these mechanism IDS is used which detects malicious activities caused by malicious nodes, Based on the risk of attack, temporary decision is made whether isolation is needed or not. IDS used in risk aware response mechanism is static based approach. Hence rule set in IDS has to be updated often by the network administrator if there are any new emerging attacks. In this paper, we propose a Authorization Enforcement Facility which uses risk as an input to determine how much a source node can be trusted.

Motivated by the idea that information flow from VAEs input to output should be reflected in the loss function, we propose to incorporate transfer entropy (TE) to loss function to quantify the information flow. Subsequently, we apply our TE-based VAEs to data analytics in Internet of Things, including data compression and generative modeling. Simulation results show that our TE-based VAEs works much better than the Kullback–Leibler divergence-based VAE in terms of reconstruction error and label error.

A common approach for retracing the attacker's steps is to start with one or more suspicious events from system logs, and perform a dependence analysis to uncover the rest of attacker's actions. The accuracy of this analysis suffers from the dependence explosion problem, which causes a very large number of benign events to be flagged as part of the attack. In this paper, we propose two novel techniques, tag attenuation and tag decay, to mitigate dependence explosion. Our techniques take advantage of common behaviors of benign processes, while providing a conservative treatment of processes and data with suspicious provenance. Our system, called Morse, is able to construct a compact scenario graph that summarizes attacker activity by sifting through millions of system events in a matter of seconds. Our experimental evaluation, carried out using data from two government-agency sponsored red team exercises, demonstrates that our techniques are (a) effective in identifying stealthy attack campaigns, (b) reduce the false alarm rates by more than an order of magnitude, and (c) yield compact scenario graphs that capture the vast majority of the attack, while leaving out benign background activity.","2375-1207","978-1-7281-3497-0","10.1109/SP40000.2020.00064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9152772","","Explosions;Security;Forensics;Attenuation;Ransomware;Linux","computer crime;digital forensics","tag attenuation;tag decay;suspicious provenance;Morse;system events;forensic analysis;suspicious events;system logs;dependence explosion problem;tag propagation semantics;advanced and persistent threats;APTs","","4","","91","","30 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The attacker may exploit this vulnerability to launch targeted low-rate injection attacks which are difficult to detect because the network traffic during attacks looks like regular network traffic. In this paper, we propose a sequence mining approach to detect low-rate injection attacks in Control Area Network (CAN). We discuss four different types of replay attacks that can be used by the adversary, and evaluate the effectiveness of proposed method for varying attack characteristics and computational performance for each of the attacks. We observe that the proposed sequence-based anomaly detection achieves over 99% f-score, and outperforms existing dictionary based and multi-variate Markov chain based approach.

To cope with this problem, we propose a heterogeneous communication data-encoding approach to extract fixed-size encoding data to apply deep learning to heterogeneous communication data by preserving the spatiotemporal characteristics of the data. Then, we propose a feature extractor based on deep learning to automatically learn hierarchical and robust communication representations without expert knowledge. We show that the proposed approach can replicate and optimize the key steps of feature engineering well and learn hierarchical representations directly from heterogeneous communication data. Moreover, compared with features extracted with principal component analysis (PCA), manifold learning and manually crafted methods, the features extracted by deep learning are more robust and are characterized by their better adaptability to various classifiers and datasets. To the best of our knowledge, the initial work here is the first to apply deep learning techniques to heterogeneous flow-level data; consequently, the heterogeneous communication data processing method can provide technical means for the application of deep learning in other communication-related research fields.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2019.2943236","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61272447); National Entrepreneurship and Innovation Demonstration Base of China(grant numbers:C700011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8846762","Deep learning;communication behavior;representation learning;feature extraction;convolution neural network","Feature extraction;Deep learning;Computer security;Data mining;Encoding;Principal component analysis;Spatiotemporal phenomena","feature extraction;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis","robust communication representations;hierarchical communication representations;fixed-size encoding data;heterogeneous communication data-encoding approach;communication representation learning;universal representation learning method;feature engineering;heterogeneous flow-level communication data;deep learning hierarchical representation;communication-related research fields;heterogeneous communication data processing method;heterogeneous flow-level data;deep learning techniques;manifold learning","","1","","35","IEEE","23 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Alerts are typically generated when intrusion detection software on computer systems (e.g., servers, routers) detect abnormal or suspicious activity. Based on the respective significance level of the alerts, some are assigned to cyber-security analysts for further investigation. Due to the wide range of potential attacks coupled with high degrees of attack sophistication, identifying what constitutes a true attack is a challenging problem, especially for organizations performing critical operations (e.g., military bases, financial institutions, etc.) that are constantly being subjected to cyber attacks every day. In this paper, we develop a game-theoretical framework that assigns cyber-security analysts to cyber alerts to minimize the overall risk faced by an organization. Our approach considers a series of games between the attacker and the defender in which a state is maintained between sub-games. The state captures the availability of analysts as well as an attack budget metric that enables us to model the level of risk an attacker is willing to undertake. Through dynamic programming and Q-maximin value iteration-based algorithms, we identify optimal allocation strategies that take into account the current availability of analysts, the risk faced by the attacker, the incoming alerts, and the future outlook of the system. We assess the effectiveness of our allocation strategies by comparing them to other sensible heuristics (e.g., random, greedy and myopic). Our results show that our approach outperforms these other strategies in minimizing risk.","","978-1-5386-7252-5","10.1109/NCS.2018.00008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8595330","Intrusion Dectection;Cyber Security;Markov Games;Game Theory;Reinforcement Learning;Cyber Alert Allocation;Network Security","Games;Resource management;Markov processes;Security;Organizations;Analytical models;Dynamic programming","dynamic programming;game theory;iterative methods;Markov processes;security of data","intrusion detection software;game-theoretical framework;dynamic programming;optimal allocation strategies;cyber attacks;Markov games;cyber-security analysts allocation;cyber alerts;Q-maximin value iteration-based algorithms","","","","18","","30 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method, labelled as Distributed Attack Detection (DAD), detects attacks in real-time by identifying anomalies in the behavior of the physical process in the plant. Anomalies are identified by using monitors that are implementations of invariants derived from the plant design. Each invariant must hold either throughout the plant operation, or when the plant is in a given state.

However, to realize the IoBNT paradigm, it is also important to seamlessly connect the biological environment with the technological landscape by having a dynamic interface design to convert biochemical signals from the human body into an equivalent electromagnetic signal (and vice versa). This, unfortunately, risks the exposure of internal biological mechanisms to cyber-based sensing and medical actuation, with potential security and privacy implications. This paper comprehensively reviews bio-cyber interface for IoBNT architecture, focusing on bio-cyber interfacing options for IoBNT like biologically inspired bio-electronic devices, RFID enabled implantable chips, and electronic tattoos. This study also identifies known and potential security and privacy vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies for consideration in future IoBNT designs and implementations.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3093442","National Research Foundation of Korea Grant through the Korean Government (Ministry of Science and ICT)(grant numbers:NRF-2020R1A2B5B02002478); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9467302","Bio-cyber interface;Internet of bio-nano things;bio-electronic device security;bio-inspired security approaches","Security;Nanobioscience;Internet;Nanoscale devices;Medical services;Biology;Wireless communication","biocybernetics;biomedical electronics;data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;nanomedicine;patient monitoring;radiofrequency identification;reviews;security of data","bio-cyber interface technologies;synthetic biology;biological cells;programmable substrates;biological embedded computing devices;artificial devices;healthcare settings;continuous health monitoring;targeted drug delivery;nanosurgeries;IoBNT paradigm;dynamic interface design;human body;equivalent electromagnetic signal;medical actuation;biologically inspired bio-electronic devices;intrabody sensing;bionanothings;biochemical signals;implantable chips;electronic tattoos","","","","241","CCBY","29 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional security mechanisms are not able to detect new/unknown types of anomalies as they do not incorporate contextual and behavioural aspects of the data for analysis. User Behaviour Anomaly Detection (UBAD) employs user behavioural patterns in context thereby achieving a higher detection rate. Log data employed for UBAD has multiple dimensions. With increase in dimensions (attributes), data gets sparse and the detection of anomalies becomes increasingly complex. For this reason, the single dimensional algorithms proposed for anomaly detection based on clustering, proximity and dimensional reduction do not work well on higher dimension data. OLAP based data analysis techniques provide efficient data slicing and aggregation operations crucial for multidimensional analytics along with multiscale visualisation for exploratory discovery. In this paper, an effective multidimensional process for UBAD is developed to detect anomalies using multi-dimensional statistical tests. An integral part of the process is the development of an OLAP Cube data model for event log data. The statistical efficiency of the UBAD process for different dimensions is investigated. On a real-life event log data, it is shown that the statistical efficiency of detection improves with the increased dimensionality of the tests: the true negative rate and the true positive rate show marked improvement. It is deduced that the computationally more expensive higher dimensional tests need to be employed in order to achieve better anomaly detection.","","978-1-5386-2450-0","10.1109/CCEM.2017.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8332549","User Behavior Anomaly Detection;UBAD;Anomaly Detection;Security Analytics;Data Analytics;Statistical Test;OLAP;Multidimensional;Data Cube;Clustering","Anomaly detection;Security;Data models;Data analysis;Big Data;Clustering algorithms","data visualisation;security of data","multidimensional data;anomalous user events;incorporate contextual aspects;behavioural aspects;UBAD;user behavioural patterns;higher detection rate;log data;higher dimension data;aggregation operations;OLAP Cube data model;user anomaly detection;OLAP-based data analysis techniques","","1","","19","","9 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The next-generation vehicles are going to be very complex cyber-physical systems, whose design must be reinvented to fulfil the increasing demand of smart services, both for safety and entertainment purposes, causing the manufacturers' model to converge towards that of IT companies. Connected cars and autonomous driving are the preeminent factors that drive along this route, and they cause the necessity of a new design to address the emerging cybersecurity issues: the “old” automotive architecture relied on a single closed network, with no external communications; modern vehicles are going to be always connected indeed, which means the attack surface will be much more extended. The result is the need for a paradigm shift towards a secure-by-design approach. In this paper, we propose a systematisation of knowledge about the core cybersecurity aspects to consider when designing a modern car. The major focus is pointed on the in-vehicle network, including its requirements, the current most used protocols and their vulnerabilities. Moreover, starting from the attackers' goals and strategies, we outline the proposed solutions and the main projects towards secure architectures.

However, the multi-sourced, correlated and heterogeneous cyber-physical system data are posing significant challenges to IDS, such as concurring cyber and physical events and data collected from different sensors, among others. To tackle the challenge, this paper proposes a novel framework based on adaptive feature boosting and ensemble learning to extract highly-representative features from multi-sourced cyber-physical system data for improved attack classification in the smart grids. Multiple Autoencoders (AE) are leveraged to extract features from different feature subsets, which are adaptively selected through a feature booster. The feature booster randomly samples features with replacement, and the features with larger probability are selected to form feature subsets and train the next AE. After training, the feature probability is updated based on the reconstruction error to increase the presence of poorly-reconstructed features in the next iteration. Each AE-extracted feature set is further applied to build one Random Forest (RF) as the base classifier, and multiple RF base classifiers are incorporated as the ensemble classifier to classify the normal, fault and attack samples. Normalization and oversampling are also applied to improve the uniformity and balance of the data. The proposed framework is evaluated on a realistic dataset of 37 sub-types of normal, fault, and attack collected from a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) security testbed. The overall classification accuracy can achieve around 91.78%, an effective 1.38% increase over the existing works.","1944-9933","978-1-7281-5508-1","10.1109/PESGM41954.2020.9281934","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9281934","Adaptive feature boosting;autoencoder;ensemble learning;security monitoring;smart grid","Radio frequency;Intrusion detection;Feature extraction;Boosting;Smart grids;Security;Monitoring","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;power engineering computing;power system security;probability;security of data;smart power grids","adaptive feature boosting;smart grid intrusion detection;intrusion detection systems;IDS;smart grid security monitoring;machine-to-machine communication;hostile threats;critical power;energy infrastructure;cyber-physical system data;heterogeneous cyber-physical system data;multisourced cyber-physical system data;attack classification;smart grids;multiple autoencoders;feature subsets;feature booster;feature probability;base classifier;multiple RF base classifiers;multisourced deep autoencoders","","","","18","","16 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With increasing connectivity due to vehicle-to-everything (V2X) and the number of electronic control units, connected EVs are facing greater cyber-physical security challenges. However, existing research extensively focuses on the network security of internal combustion engine vehicles and fails to address the cyber-physical security of EVs specifically. In this article, the challenges and future visions of cyber-physical security are discussed for connected EVs from the perspective of firmware security, vehicle charging safety, and powertrain control security. The vulnerabilities of EVs are investigated under a variety of cyberattacks, ranging from energy-efficiency-motivated attacks to safety-motivated attacks. Simulation results, including hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) results, are provided to further analyze the cyberattack impacts on both converter (device) and vehicle (system) levels. More importantly, an architecture for the next-generation power electronics systems is proposed to address the cyber-physical security challenges of EVs. Finally, potential research opportunities are discussed in detail, including detection and migration for firmware security, model-based, and data-driven detection and mitigation.

In this paper, a comprehensive control and learning framework is proposed to thwart cyber and physical attacks on ACV networks. First, an optimal safe controller for ACVs is derived to maximize the street traffic flow while minimizing the risk of accidents by optimizing the ACV speed and inter-ACV spacing. It is proven that the proposed controller is robust to physical attacks which aim at making ACV systems unstable. Next, two data injection attack (DIA) detection approaches are proposed to address cyber attacks on sensors and their physical impact on the ACV system. The proposed approaches rely on leveraging the stochastic behavior of the sensor readings and on the use of a multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithm. It is shown that, collectively, the proposed DIA detection approaches minimize the vulnerability of ACV sensors against cyber attacks while maximizing the ACV system's physical robustness. Simulation results show that the proposed optimal safe controller outperforms the current state of the art controllers by maximizing the robustness of ACVs to physical attacks. The results also show that the proposed DIA detection approaches, compared to Kalman filtering, can improve the security of ACV sensors against cyber attacks and ultimately improve the physical robustness of an ACV system.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2927570","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:OAC-1541105,CNS-1446621); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8758129","Autonomous connected vehicles;cyber-physical security;data injection attack;optimal safe control;multi-armed bandit learning","Servers;Resource management;Load management;Time complexity;Load modeling;Data centers;Network function virtualization","intelligent transportation systems;Kalman filters;learning (artificial intelligence);optimal control;security of data","cyber-physical security;optimal control;multiarmed bandit learning;autonomous connected vehicles rely;ACVs;intra-vehicle sensors;inter-vehicle communication;cyber attacks;physical attacks;sensor readings;comprehensive control;ACV networks;optimal safe controller;ACV speed;inter-ACV spacing;ACV systems unstable;data injection attack detection approaches;physical impact;ACV system;multiarmed bandit algorithm;DIA detection approaches;ACV sensors;physical robustness","","13","","44","IEEE","9 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An impersonation attack is an attack in which an adversary is disguised as a legitimate party in a system or communications protocol. The connected devices are pervasive, generating high-dimensional data on a large scale, which complicates simultaneous detections. Feature learning, however, can circumvent the potential problems that could be caused by the large-volume nature of network data. This paper thus proposes a novel deep-feature extraction and selection (D-FES), which combines stacked feature extraction and weighted feature selection. The stacked autoencoding is capable of providing representations that are more meaningful by reconstructing the relevant information from its raw inputs. We then combine this with modified weighted feature selection inspired by an existing shallow-structured machine learner. We finally demonstrate the ability of the condensed set of features to reduce the bias of a machine learner model as well as the computational complexity. Our experimental results on a well-referenced Wi-Fi network benchmark data set, namely, the Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion data set, prove the usefulness and the utility of the proposed D-FES by achieving a detection accuracy of 99.918% and a false alarm rate of 0.012%, which is the most accurate detection of impersonation attacks reported in the literature.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2017.2762828","Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion through the Korea Government (MSIT) (Research on Communication Technology using Bio-Inspired Algorithm and 2017-0-00555, Towards Provable-secure Multi-party Authenticated Key Exchange Protocol based on Lattices in a Quantum World)(grant numbers:2013-0-00396); National Research Foundation of Korea through the Korea Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:NRF-2015R1A-2A2A01006812); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8067440","Intrusion detection system;impersonation attack;deep learning;feature extraction;stacked autoencoder;large-scale Wi-Fi networks","Feature extraction;Wireless fidelity;Support vector machines;Wireless networks;Computational modeling;Security;Machine learning","computer network security;feature extraction;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","simultaneous detections;feature learning;large-volume nature;deep-feature extraction;modified weighted feature selection;Wi-Fi network benchmark data;Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion data;detection accuracy;accurate detection;impersonation attack;Wi-Fi impersonation detection;mobile technologies;security challenges;wireless medium;high-dimensional data;shallow-structured machine learner","","42","","71","IEEE","13 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we propose ConFirm, a low-cost technique to detect malicious modifications in the firmware of embedded control systems by measuring the number of low-level hardware events that occur during the execution of the firmware. In order to count these events, ConFirm leverages the Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs), which readily exist in many embedded processors. We propose a comparison-based technique to detect malicious modifications in firmwares with simple control-flows. For firmwares with more complex control-flows, we use machine learning techniques to automatically extract the relations among different hardware events. This method significantly reduces the number of pre-stored valid HPC signatures without compromising the detection accuracy. Finally, we reduce the consumption of local resources by implementing a remote-based detection mechanism.

As a major enabler for IoT, IPv6-based low-power and lossy networks (LLNs) have been receiving considerable attention as a mature solution for scalable data collection in a ubiquitous computing and communication infrastructure. In order to provide efficient point-to-multipoint and multipoint-to-point communication, a novel routing protocol for LLNs, also well known as RPL, has been proposed and standardized. Nonetheless, due to devices' constraints on processing power, memory, and energy, and the lack of specific security models of the RPL routing protocol, LLNs become an ideal target for various security attacks. In this article, we propose a Gini index-based countermeasure, also called GINI, to effectively detect and mitigate sybil attack in RPL-based LLNs, where the malicious node multicasts an excessive number of DODAG information solicitation (DIS) messages with different fictitious identities to cause the legitimate nodes to restart the Trickle algorithm frequently and broadcast a large number of DODAG information object (DIO) messages to quickly drain the limited energy resource of legitimate nodes.

Accordingly, vehicles, usually referred to as smart, are seeing their architecture revamped to integrate connection to the outside environment (V2X) and autonomous driving. A significant part of these innovations is enabled by machine learning. However, deploying such systems raises some concerns. First, the complexity of the algorithms often prevents understanding what these models learn, which is relevant in the safety-critical context of mobility. Second, several studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of machine learning-based algorithms to adversarial attacks. For these reasons, research on the explainability of machine learning is raising. In this paper, we then explore the role of interpretable machine learning in the ecosystem of smart vehicles, with the goal of figuring out if and in what terms explanations help to design secure vehicles. We provide an overview of the potential uses of explainable machine learning, along with recent work in the literature that has started to investigate the topic, including from the perspectives of human-agent systems and cyber-physical systems.

However, it is well-known that adversaries can adapt their attacks to evade detection. There has been some work on making machine learning models more robust to such attacks. However, one simple but promising approach called randomization is under-explored. In addition, most existing works focus on models with differentiable error functions while tree-based models do not have such error functions but are quite popular because they are easy to interpret. This paper proposes a novel randomization-based approach to improve robustness of tree-based models against evasion attacks. The proposed approach incorporates randomization into both model training time and model application time (meaning when the model is used to detect attacks). We also apply this approach to random forest, an existing ML method which already has incorporated randomness at training time but still often fails to generate robust models. We proposed a novel weighted-random-forest method to generate more robust models and a clustering method to add randomness at model application time. We also proposed a theoretical framework to provide a lower bound for adversaries' effort. Experiments on intrusion detection and spam filtering data show that our approach further improves robustness of random-forest method.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2020.2987299","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9068471","Evasion attacks;Machine Learning;Adversarial Learning;Intrusion Detection;Spam Filtering","Robustness;Electronic mail;Vegetation;Data models;Forestry;Decision trees;Training","","","","","","","IEEE","15 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Detection of such an infection is challenging due to its similarity to legitimate advertising activities. An interesting observation we make in our research is that such an attack almost always incurs a great semantic gap between the infected domain (e.g., a university site) and the content it promotes (e.g., selling cheap viagra). Exploiting this gap, we developed a semantic-based technique, called Semantic Inconsistency Search (SEISE), for efficient and accurate detection of the promotional injections on sponsored top-level domains (sTLD) with explicit semantic meanings. Our approach utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify the bad terms (those related to illicit activities like fake drug selling, etc.) most irrelevant to an sTLD's semantics. These terms, which we call irrelevant bad terms (IBTs), are used to query search engines under the sTLD for suspicious domains. Through a semantic analysis on the results page returned by the search engines, SEISE is able to detect those truly infected sites and automatically collect new IBTs from the titles/URLs/snippets of their search result items for finding new infections. Running on 403 sTLDs with an initial 30 seed IBTs, SEISE analyzed 100K fully qualified domain names (FQDN), and along the way automatically gathered nearly 600 IBTs. In the end, our approach detected 11K infected FQDN with a false detection rate of 1.5% and over 90% coverage. Our study shows that by effective detection of infected sTLDs, the bar to promotion infections can be substantially raised, since other non-sTLD vulnerable domains typically have much lower Alexa ranks and are therefore much less attractive for underground advertising. Our findings further bring to light the stunning impacts of such promotional attacks, which compromise FQDNs under 3% of .edu, .gov domains and over one thousand gov.cn domains, including those of leading universities such as stanford.edu, mit.edu, princeton.edu, havard.edu and government institutes such as nsf.gov and nih.gov. We further demonstrate the potential to extend our current technique to protect generic domains such as .com and .org.","2375-1207","978-1-5090-0824-7","10.1109/SP.2016.48","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7546531","NLP;security;promotional infection;semantic","Semantics;Government;Search engines;Advertising;Drugs;Uniform resource locators;Blogs","advertising data processing;natural language processing;query processing;search engines;Web sites","promotional-infection detection;semantic inconsistency search;Web site;semantic gap;SEISE;promotional injection detection;sponsored top-level domains;sTLD;explicit semantic;natural language processing;NLP;irrelevant bad terms;IBTs;search engine querying;suspicious domains;semantic analysis;infected site detection;fully qualified domain names;FQDN;underground advertising;promotional attacks","","18","","35","","18 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, we formulate the problem of recognizing authorized transmitters and rejecting new transmitters as open set recognition and anomaly detection. We consider approaches based on one and several binary classifiers, multiclass classifiers, and signal reconstruction. We study how these approaches scale with the required number of authorized transmitters. We propose using a known set of unauthorized transmitters to assist the training and study its impact. The evaluation procedure takes into consideration that some transmitters might be more similar than others and nuances these effects. The authorization's robustness against temporal changes in fingerprints is also evaluated as a function of the approach and the dataset structure.

In this paper, we propose a novel sparse representation framework that learns dictionaries based on the latent space of variational auto-encoder. For large-scale data sets, it can play the role of dimensionality reduction to obtain hidden information, and extract more high-level features than hand-crafted features. At the same time, for the storage of normal information, the space cost can be greatly reduced. To verify the versatility and performance of the proposed learning algorithm, we have experimented on different types of anomaly detection tasks, including KDD-CUP data set for network intrusion detection, Mnist data set for image anomaly detection, and UCSD pedestrian's data set for abnormal event detection in surveillance videos.

Cyber deception has emerged as a defense approach to secure our cyber infrastructure from APTs. Practical deployment of cyber deception relies on defenders' ability to place decoy nodes along the APT path optimally. This paper presents a cyber deception approach focused on predicting the most likely sequence of attack paths and deploying decoy nodes along the predicted path. Our proposed approach combines reactive (graph analysis) and proactive (cyber deception technology) defense to thwart the adversaries' lateral movement. The proposed approach is realized through two phases. The first phase predicts the most likely attack path based on Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alerts and network trace, and the second phase is determining optimal deployment of decoy nodes along the predicted path. We employ transition probabilities in a Hidden Markov Model to predict the path. In the second phase, we utilize the predicted attack path to deploy decoy nodes. However, it is likely that the attacker will not follow that predicted path to move laterally. To address this challenge, we employ a Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Planning (POMCP) framework. POMCP helps the defender assess several defense actions to block the attacker when it deviates from the predicted path. The evaluation results show that our approach can predict the most likely attack paths and thwarts the adversarial lateral movement.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3069105","Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering [OASD (R & E)](grant numbers:FA8750-15-2-0120); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9387290","Cyber deception;cyber defense;cyber decoy;lateral movement;intrusion detection system;hidden Markov Model;attack path prediction","Hidden Markov models;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Games;Intrusion detection;Cyberattack;Training","computer network security;hidden Markov models;Monte Carlo methods","Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Planning;cyber infrastructure;defense approach;multistage attacks;advanced persistent threats;adversarial lateral movement;predicted attack path;hidden Markov model;cyber deception technology;decoy nodes;attack paths;cyber deception approach;APT path","","","","51","CCBY","26 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, this massive growth of IoT devices and the corresponding huge data traffic generated at the edge of the network created additional burdens on the state-of-the-art centralized cloud computing paradigm due to the bandwidth and resource scarcity. Hence, edge computing (EC) is emerging as an innovative strategy that brings data processing and storage near to the end users, leading to what is called the EC-assisted IoT. Although this paradigm provides unique features and enhanced Quality of Service (QoS), it also introduces huge risks in data security and privacy aspects. This article conducts a comprehensive survey on security and privacy issues in the context of EC-assisted IoT. In particular, we first present an overview of EC-assisted IoT, including definitions, applications, architecture, advantages, and challenges. Second, we define security and privacy in the context of EC-assisted IoT.

We conducted an impact-oriented analysis approach on the wireless communication medium; the main method considered to remotely access the PeopleBot robot. Numerous experiments using SSH and server-client applications were conducted, and they demonstrated that certain attacks result in denying remote access service to the PeopleBot robot.

However, recent adversarial attacks, such as data poisoning, evasion attacks, and exploratory attacks, have shown to be able to either cause the machine learning methods to misbehave, or leak sensitive model parameters. In this work, we have devised a prototype of a malware cognitive system, called DeepArmour, which performs robust malware classification against adversarial attacks. At the heart of our method is a voting system with three different machine learning malware classifiers: random forest, multi-layer perceptron, and structure2vec. In addition, DeepArmour applies several adversarial countermeasures, such as feature reconstruction and adversarial retraining to strengthen the robustness. We tested DeepArmour on a malware execution trace dataset, which has 12, 536 malware in five categories. We are able to achieve 0.989 accuracy with 10-fold cross validation. Further, to demonstrate the ability of combating adversarial attacks, we have performed a white-box evasion attack on the dataset and showed how our system is resilient to such attacks. Particularly, DeepArmour is able to achieve 0.675 accuracy for the generated adversarial attacks which are unknown to the model. After retraining with only 10% adversarial samples, DeepArmour is able to achieve 0.839 accuracy.","","978-1-7281-2711-8","10.1109/ICCC.2019.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8817015","cognitive, machine learning, malware, adversary","Malware;Training;Cognitive systems;Testing;Data models;Random forests","cognitive systems;invasive software;multilayer perceptrons;pattern classification;random forests","malware cognitive system;DeepArmour;white-box evasion attack;adversarial attacks;malware classification;machine learning malware classifiers;random forest;multilayer perceptron;structure2vec","","3","","46","","29 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose ACOBE, an Anomaly detection method based on COmpound BEhavior, which takes into consideration long-term patterns and group behaviors.

Thanks to the increasing availability of high-quality data and the success of deep learning algorithms, machine learning (ML)-based detection and classification have been increasingly effective and adopted against sophisticated attacks. However, many of these techniques rely on the assumptions that the training and testing datasets share the same distribution and the same class labels in a stationary environment. As such assumptions may fail to hold when the system dynamics shift and new threat variants emerge in a non-stationary environment, the capability of trained ML models to adapt in complex operating scenarios will be critical to their deployment in real-world smart grid communications. To this aim, this paper proposes a domain-adversarial transfer learning framework for robust intrusion detection against smart grid attacks. The framework introduces domain-adversarial training to create a mapping between the labeled source domain and the unlabeled target domain so that the classifiers can learn in a new feature space against unknown threats. The proposed framework with different baseline classifiers was evaluated using a smart grid cyber-attack dataset collected over a realistic hardware-in-the- loop security testbed. The results have demonstrated effective performance improvements of trained classifiers against unseen threats of different types and locations.","","978-1-5386-8099-5","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2019.8909793","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8909793","","Feature extraction;Smart grids;Training;Machine learning;Intrusion detection;Task analysis","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;power engineering computing;power system security;smart power grids","robust intrusion detection;cyber-physical attack threats;complex cyber-infrastructure;deep learning algorithms;class labels;stationary environment;trained ML models;real-world smart grid communications;domain-adversarial transfer learning framework;smart grid attacks;domain-adversarial training;labeled source domain;unlabeled target domain;smart grid cyber-attack dataset;trained classifiers","","1","","24","","25 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we focus on attack projection that is aimed to predict the next step of the attack based on historical information and gained knowledge of similar events happened in the past. Previous models on attack projection based on probability graph model or simple RNN models, which may limit their capability of noise tolerance and sequence association analysis. To remedy this, we propose a method called ALEAP which incorporates event embedding and attention mechanism into LSTM models to better predict the future events. We test ALEAP on a dataset of millions of security events collected from the multi-source security devices, and show that our approach is effective in event prediction.

As this consolidation gets stronger, the need for security in IoT increases. With first line of defense strategies like cryptography being unsuited due to the resource constrained nature, second line of defense mechanisms are crucial to ensure security in IoT networks. This paper presents a comprehensive study of existing second line of defense mechanisms for standardized protocols in IoT networks. The paper analyzes existing mechanisms in three aspects: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) and Intrusion Response Systems (IRS). We begin by providing an overview of standardized protocol stack, its layers and defensive security systems in IoT. From there, we build our narrative by presenting an extended taxonomy of IDS, IPS and IRS classifying them on their techniques, deployment, attacks, datasets, evaluation metrics and data pre-processing methods. We then thoroughly review, compare and analyze the research proposals in this context, considering the unique characteristics involved in these systems.

While traditional intrusion detection and prevention system might successfully detect low or moderate levels of attack, the cooperation among different organizations is necessary to defend against multi-stage and large-scale cyber-attacks. Correlating intrusion alerts from a shared database of multiple sources provides security analysts with succinct and high-level patterns of cyber-attacks - a powerful tool to combat with sophisticate attacks. However, sharing intrusion alert data raises a significant privacy concern among data holders, since publishing this information means a risk of exposing other sensitive information such as intranet topology, network services, and the security infrastructure. This paper discusses possible cryptographic approaches to tackle this issue. Organizers can encrypt their intrusion alert data to protect data confidentiality and outsource them to a shared server to reduce the cost of storage and maintenance, while, at the same time, benefit from a larger source of information for alert correlation process. Two privacy preserving alert correlation techniques are proposed under semi-honest model.

Adversaries can use fake CTI examples as training input to subvert cyber defense systems, forcing their models to learn incorrect inputs to serve the attackers' malicious needs. In this paper, we show how to automatically generate fake CTI text descriptions using transformers.

We use the generated fake CTI text to perform a data poisoning attack on a Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph (CKG) and a cybersecurity corpus. The attack introduced adverse impacts such as returning incorrect reasoning outputs, representation poisoning, and corruption of other dependent AI-based cyber defense systems.

Previous efforts mostly focused on detection accuracy, and our goal is to chart a path towards a more comprehensive definition of trustworthy detection, that consists of accuracy, transparency, and proactivity. To achieve the goal, we identify key challenges rooting at the specific settings of the above applications: the evolving nature and unexpectedness of the fraudsters' strategies, the ever-growing large amount of data, and the increasing complexity of effective detectors.

We modify the GAN objective function and the training procedure for the malicious anomaly detection task. The model only requires normal operation data to be trained, making it cheaper to deploy and robust against unseen attacks. Moreover, the model operates on the raw input data, eliminating the need for feature extraction.

However, using this kind of game is tedious and error prone on large networks because it assumes that the analyst has prior and complete knowledge of critical network services. This work presents a non-zero, Deterministic Game-Theoretic Modeling (DGM) method for analyzing the security of computer networks. The interaction between an attacker and a defender is viewed as two-player non-zero deterministic game whose model is constructed using a saddle point solution (non-linear program) to compute the value of the game. The probability of possible attack on a network given available attacker strategy or best-response strategies for the attacker and the defender was demonstrated. The simulation of the model was achieved using Java, which is a high level language with object oriented programming capabilities and features. The backend is implemented using MySQL, which is a widely used relational database management system (RDBMS).

In such scenarios, an adversary who has compromised the relay can affect the network's performance by deliberately dropping the packets transmitted by the IoT devices and/or by corrupting the packets to be forwarded by the relay. In this way, the adversary can successfully mimic a bad radio channel between the IoT devices and the relay, thereby requiring the IoT devices to retransmit more frequently. Such a strategy increases the processing load on the IoT devices and will drain their batteries at a faster rate. To detect such an attack, we present hybrid intrusion detection systems that rely on the monitoring of uplink and downlink packets transmitted between IoT devices and the relay. Specifically, we compare the observed packet drop probabilities against their long-term expected values. The detection rules proposed originate from the generalized likelihood ratio test, where the adversary parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. A semi-analytical approach to obtain the expressions for the false alarm probability is presented in order to determine the decision thresholds. Results presented show the effectiveness of the proposed detection systems, demonstrate the impact of the choice of adversary parameters on them, and validate the expressions obtained for the false alarm probability.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2019.2922262","National Research Foundation Singapore; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8735822","Generalized likelihood ratio;maximum likelihood estimation (MLE);packet drop probability (PDP);malicious relay","Relays;Downlink;Uplink;Internet of Things;Batteries;Monitoring;Security","computer network reliability;computer network security;Internet of Things;maximum likelihood estimation;pattern clustering;probability;relay networks (telecommunication);security of data;wireless channels","network scalability problem;hybrid intrusion detection systems;observed packet drop probabilities;relay misbehavior detection;clustered IoT network devices;clustering Internet of Things networks;radio channel;downlink packet transmission monitoring;uplink packet transmission monitoring;generalized likelihood ratio test;maximum likelihood estimation;false alarm probability","","4","","33","IEEE","12 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since CAN message is broadcast from a transmitter to the other nodes on a bus, it does not contain information about the source and destination address for validation. Therefore, an attacker can easily inject any message to lead system malfunctions. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection method based on the analysis of the offset ratio and time interval between request and response messages in CAN. If a remote frame having a particular identifier is transmitted, a receiver node should respond to the remote frame immediately. In attack-free state, each node has a fixed response offset ratio and time interval while these values vary in attack state. Using this property, we can measure the response performance of the existing nodes based on the offset ratio and time interval between request and response messages. As a result, our methodology can detect intrusions by monitoring offset ratio and time interval, and it allows quick intrusion detection with high accuracy.","","978-1-5386-2487-6","10.1109/PST.2017.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8476919","","Protocols;Intrusion detection;Authentication;Delays;Electronic mail;Standards","controller area networks;security of data","In-vehicle Network;remote frame;Controller Area Network;bus communication protocol;in-vehicle nodes;CAN message;destination address;system malfunctions;intrusion detection method;time interval;response messages;receiver node;attack-free state;fixed response offset ratio;attack state;response performance;intrusion detection system;source address;request messages","","50","","20","","30 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An interesting, preliminary result is that classifier security to evasion may be even worsened by the application of feature selection. In this paper, we provide a more detailed investigation of this aspect, shedding some light on the security properties of feature selection against evasion attacks.

SOC are also motivated to keep their models private to capitalize on the models that are their propriety expertise, and to protect their detection strategies against adversarial machine learning. In this paper, we develop a protocol for privately evaluating detection models on the system data, in which privacy of both the system data and detection models is protected and information leakage is either prevented altogether or quantifiably decreased. Our main approach is to provide an end-to-end encryption for the system data and detection models utilizing lattice-based cryptography that allows homomorphic operations over ciphertext.

These NIDS perform better when they can monitor all the traffic traversing through the network like when being deployed on a Software-Defined Network (SDN). Because of the inability to detect zero-day attacks, signature-based NIDS which were traditionally used for detecting malicious traffic are beginning to get replaced by anomaly-based NIDS built on neural networks. However, recently it has been shown that such NIDS have their own drawback namely being vulnerable to the adversarial example attack. Moreover, they were mostly evaluated on the old datasets which don't represent the variety of attacks network systems might face these days. In this paper, we present Reconstruction from Partial Observation (RePO) as a new mechanism to build an NIDS with the help of denoising autoencoders capable of detecting different types of network attacks in a low false alert setting with an enhanced robustness against adversarial example attack. Our evaluation conducted on a dataset with a variety of network attacks shows denoising autoencoders can improve detection of malicious traffic by up to 29% in a normal setting and by up to 45% in an adversarial setting compared to other recently proposed anomaly detectors.","","978-1-7281-8159-2","10.1109/NFV-SDN50289.2020.9289869","NSF(grant numbers:1700527); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9289869","Intrusion Detection Systems;Neural Networks;Anomaly Detection;Adversarial Example","Noise reduction;Neural networks;Network intrusion detection;Robustness;Network function virtualization;Software defined networking;Monitoring","computer network security;security of data;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic","denoising autoencoders;reconstruction from partial observation;software-defined network;adversarial setting;network attacks;attacks network systems;adversarial example attack;neural networks;anomaly-based NIDS;malicious traffic;signature-based NIDS;zero-day attacks;traffic traversing;network intrusion detection system;cyber attacks","","2","","25","","24 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, there have continuously been crucial need for timely, accurate identification and detection of these intrusions. Several traditional intrusion detection systems proposed in the literature have proven inefficient as they are computationally incompetent for the complex nature of the modern power systems. An alternative has been identified in form of machine learning techniques. This paper presents an empirical comparison of five prominent machine learning algorithms: K-nearest neighbors, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and AdaBoost for predicting intrusion attacks into power systems network. The idea is to present the best possible classifier for the analyzed test systems and also to show that each of the developed algorithms can perform exceptionally well within some context.

In this paper, we develop a novel strategic resource availability management (STREAM) system to improve information integrity and availability in an energy constrained CPS environment under the presence of malicious adversaries. The term “resource” here can be any component of a CPS. The main elements of STREAM are: 1) difficult but realistic “repeated (adversary-defender) game” settings and 2) a set of provably optimal defender strategies plus effective heuristics, against equally potent adversary moves. STREAM is based on the concept of dynamic games in sequential game theory, and is the first system to incorporate the realistic behavioral aspect that in many CPSs, both, the class of adversaries, as well as the class of CPS protectors, could move in a covert and stealthy manner in order to outwit the other in the war on “resource control.” In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of STREAM strategies to improve CPS resource availability to the nonadversary, we first conduct a thorough theoretical analysis on a model smart grid CPS as a representative example of a CPS. We then follow up the analysis with an extensive simulation study on the standard IEEE 14 smart power grid architecture. The results show that STREAM strategies improve smart grid system integrity and availability by approximately upto 67% when compared to nonstrategic approaches.

In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based attack detection (AD) scheme, as part of our overall CPS security strategies. The proposed scheme performs AD at the physical layer by modeling and monitoring physics or physical behavior of the physical asset or process. In developing the proposed AD scheme, we devote our efforts on intelligently deriving salient signatures or features out of the large number of noisy physical measurements by leveraging physical knowledge and using advanced machine learning techniques. Such derived features not only capture the physical relationships among the measurements but also have more discriminant power in distinguishing normal and attack activities. In our experimental study for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed AD scheme, we consider heavy-duty gas turbines of combined cycle power plants as the CPS application. Using the data from both the high-fidelity simulation and several real plants, we demonstrate that our proposed AD scheme is effective in early detection of attacks or malicious activities.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2919635","Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability(grant numbers:DEOE0000833); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8728231","Attack detection (AD);cyber security;cyber-physical system (CPS);feature engineering;gas turbines;machine learning","Machine learning;Security;Feature extraction;Turbines;Internet of Things;Monitoring","combined cycle power stations;gas turbines;learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;security of data","CPS application;physical components;machine learning-based attack detection scheme;CPS security strategies;physical layer;physical behavior;physical asset;AD scheme;salient signatures;noisy physical measurements;physical knowledge;physical relationships;attack activities;cyber-physical system security;information technology security;advanced machine learning techniques;IT security;heavy-duty gas turbines;combined cycle power plants;high-fidelity simulation;malicious activities","","9","","46","IEEE","3 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Passengers can obtain information by searching over Internet or querying vehicles in proximity through intra-vehicle equipment. Hence, the performance of content dissemination in VSNs heavily relies on inter-vehicle communication and human behaviors. However, privacy preservation always conflicts with the usability of individual information in VSNs. The highly dynamic topology and increasing kinds of participants lead to potential threats for communication security and individual privacy. Therefore, the privacy-preserving solutions for content dissemination in VSNs have become extremely challenging, and numerous researches have been conducted recently. Compared with related surveys, this article provides the unique characteristics of privacy-preserving requirements and solutions for content dissemination in VSNs. It focuses on: 1) a comprehensive overview of content dissemination in VSNs; 2) the privacy issues and potential attacks related to content dissemination; and 3) the corresponding solutions based on privacy consideration. First, the characteristics of VSNs, content dissemination and its solutions in VSNs are revealed.

In this paper, we propose a novel cyber-threat exploiting the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol to implement a tunneling attack. In IoT networks, sensitive and critical information are exchanged between devices or external systems to perform data analysis. For this reason, a tunneling threat could be adopted by a malicious user to steal information. In this context, a tunneling system based on MQTT can be considered since this communication protocol could be allowed to pass through enterprise firewalls because it is widely adopted in this IoT world. An attacker can exploit the MQTT protocol for various purposes such as steal information or access to not-allowed websites/servers. In particular in this work, we contribute in two main points: initially we demonstrate how the proposed threat is able to encapsulate messages through the MQTT protocol, by also comparing it with other tunneling systems exploiting different communication protocols. Obtained results show that exploiting MQTT for tunneling purposes is a good choice, compared to other communication protocols, especially for payloads up to 3000 bytes. Then, we propose and validate an initial machine learning based approach able to detect the proposed MQTT tunnel, by comparing different detection algorithms tested with and without a hyperparameter optimization, in terms of accuracy, F1 score and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. In this case, obtained results show that some algorithms are able to identify the attack, with an accuracy exceeding 95%, while others lack of such capability.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3099642","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9493887","Cyber-security;network security;IoT;MQTT;tunneling systems;machine learning;detection algorithms;data exfiltration","Protocols;Tunneling;Internet of Things;Security;Authentication;Support vector machines;Performance evaluation","Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;queueing theory;telemetry;transport protocols","Internet of Things;malicious data exfiltration activities;pervasive technology;cyber-security;message queue telemetry transport protocol;IoT networks;data analysis;communication protocols;MQTT tunnel protocol;tunneling attacks;hyperparameter optimization;F1 score;receiver operating characteristic curve;ROC curve;machine learning based approach","","","","89","CCBY","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many of these attacks have effectively accomplished their malicious goals because intruders conduct cyber-attacks using novel and innovative techniques. An anomaly-based IDS (Intrusion Detection System) uses machine learning techniques to detect and classify attacks in IoT networks. In the presence of unpredictable network technologies and various intrusion methods, traditional machine learning techniques appear inefficient. In many research areas, deep learning methods have shown their ability to identify anomalies accurately. Convolutional neural networks are an excellent alternative for anomaly detection and classification due to their ability to automatically categorize main characteristics in input data and their effectiveness in performing faster computations. In this paper, we design and develop a novel anomaly-based intrusion detection model for IoT networks. First, a convolutional neural network model is used to create a multiclass classification model. The proposed model is then implemented using convolutional neural networks in 1D, 2D, and 3D. The proposed convolutional neural network model is validated using the BoT-IoT, IoT Network Intrusion, MQTT-IoT-IDS2020, and IoT-23 intrusion detection datasets. Transfer learning is used to implement binary and multiclass classification using a convolutional neural network multiclass pre-trained model.

This paper presents a blockchain-based solution, which is designed for the smart home domain, dealing with the collection and preservation of digital forensic evidence. The system utilizes a private forensic evidence database, where the captured evidence is stored, along with a permissioned blockchain that allows providing security services like integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation, so that the evidence can be used in a court of law. The blockchain stores evidences' metadata, which are critical for providing the aforementioned services, and interacts via smart contracts with the different entities involved in an investigation process, including Internet service providers, law enforcement agencies and prosecutors.

Accordingly, it is difficult to apply machine learning-based techniques and defences in practice. Reinforcement learning (RL) may overcome this detection problem for DDoS attacks by managing and monitoring consequences; an agent's role is to learn to optimise performance criteria (which are always available) in an online manner. We advance the state-of-the-art in RL-based DDoS mitigation by introducing two agent classes designed to act on a per-flow basis, in a protocol-agnostic manner for any network topology. This is supported by an in-depth investigation of feature suitability and empirical evaluation. Our results show the existence of flow features with high predictive power for different traffic classes, when used as a basis for feedback-loop-like control.

RBM training can be performed using contrastive divergence (CD) and quantum annealing (QA). QA-based RBM training is fundamentally different from CD and requires samples from a quantum computer. We present a real-world application that uses a quantum computer. Specifically, we train a RBM using QA for cybersecurity applications. The D-Wave 2000Q has been used to implement QA. RBMs are trained on the ISCX data, which is a benchmark dataset for cybersecurity. For comparison, RBMs are also trained using CD. CD is a commonly used method for RBM training. Our analysis of the ISCX data shows that the dataset is imbalanced. We present two different schemes to balance the training dataset before feeding it to a classifier. The first scheme is based on the undersampling of benign instances. The imbalanced training dataset is divided into five sub-datasets that are trained separately. A majority voting is then performed to get the result. Our results show the majority vote increases the classification accuracy up from 90.24% to 95.68%, in the case of CD. For the case of QA, the classification accuracy increases from 74.14% to 80.04%. In the second scheme, a RBM is used to generate synthetic data to balance the training dataset. We show that both QA and CD-trained RBM can be used to generate useful synthetic data. Balanced training data is used to evaluate several classifiers. Among the classifiers investigated, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Neural Network (NN) perform better than other classifiers. They both show an accuracy of 93%. Our results show a proof-of-concept that a QA-based RBM can be trained on a 64-bit binary dataset. The illustrative example suggests the possibility to migrate many practical classification problems to QA-based techniques. Further, we show that synthetic data generated from a RBM can be used to balance the original dataset.","2471-285X","","10.1109/TETCI.2021.3074916","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9432948","RBM training;D-Wave quantum computer;quantum annealing;machine learning;synthetic data;cybersecurity;ISCX dataset","Training;Annealing;Computer security;Computational modeling;Training data;Qubit;Computer hacking","","","","","","","IEEE","17 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, the data collected from smart homes usually need to be processed by a cloud server, which means there is a risk of leaking the privacy of users during the transmission. In this situation, edge computing is considered to be an ideal platform for smart home, which enable data to be processed at edge nodes. Unfortunately, because of unsecured Wi-Fi connection and smart devices, edge nodes also have the possibility to encounter malicious attacks. Hence, in this paper, we designed an intrusion detection system (IDS) to be deployed on edge nodes. We convert network traffic to images which are applied to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the categories of network traffic. Furthermore, Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (AC-GAN) is adopted to generate synthesized samples to expand the intrusion detection dataset. We experiment on the UNSW-NB15 dataset which contains substantial network traffic about the normal and anomalies. The proposed scheme is effective to minor categories of which precision could be improved 12%. Besides, the precision can reach 96% in binary classification about normal and anomaly.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-5089-5","10.1109/ICC40277.2020.9148632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9148632","Intrusion detection;Smart home;Data augmentation;GAN;Edge computing","Smart homes;Intrusion detection;Training;Data models;Edge computing;Smart devices","cloud computing;convolutional neural nets;home computing;Internet of Things;pattern classification;security of data;wireless LAN","network traffic;auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network;intrusion detection system;edge nodes;smart devices;prompt development;edge computing;data augmentation;smart home security;intrusion detection dataset","","","","26","","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"WF-GAN: Fighting Back Against Website Fingerprinting Attack Using Adversarial Learning","C. Hou; G. Gou; J. Shi; P. Fu; G.

WF attackers recognize encrypted website traffic through constructing fingerprinting for each website using the flow-based features extracted from encrypted traffic. WF defense typically aims at modifying the features of the encrypted websites. However, those countermeasures either cause high overhead or fail to counter the subsequent WF attacks. Especially, the newest WF attacks, which are based on deep neural network, is able to classify the defended traffic by directly learning from the labeled defended traffic. In this paper, we propose an novel defense through making use of the trick that machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial exmaples. We design WF-GAN, a GAN with an additional WF classifier component, to generate adversarial examples for WF classifiers through adversarial learning. As the website set is divided into source and target website, WF-GAN are trained to map websites features from source set to adversarial examples and make adversarial examples more similar to the website features in the target set. The experimental result shows that WF-GAN achieves 90% success rate with at most 15% overhead for untargeted defense, which outperforms previous defense. In addition, adversarial examples based defense support targeted defense, which is not support by traditional defense. The result shows that WF-GAN achieves over 90% targeted defense success rate when the target websites set is twice as many as the source website set.","2642-7389","978-1-7281-8086-1","10.1109/ISCC50000.2020.9219593","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9219593","network security;privacy;adversarial learning","","computer network security;cryptography;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;telecommunication traffic;Web sites","Website features;WF classifiers;WF attacks;encrypted websites;WF defense;Website traffic;encrypted Web traffic;side-channel attack;adversarial learning;Website fingerprinting attack;WF-GAN","","","","25","","12 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the increase in the number of connected devices, several challenges are also coming up with IoT technology: heterogeneity, scalability, quality of service, security requirements, and many more. Security management takes a back seat in IoT because of cost, size, and power. It poses a significant risk as lack of security makes users skeptical towards using IoT devices. This, in turn, makes IoT vulnerable to security attacks, ultimately causing enormous financial and reputational losses. It makes up for an urgent need to assess present security risks and discuss the upcoming challenges to be ready to face the same. The undertaken study is a multi-fold survey of different security issues present in IoT layers: perception layer, network layer, support layer, application layer, with further focus on Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks are significant threats for the cyber world because of their potential to bring down the victims. Different types of DDoS attacks, DDoS attacks in IoT devices, impacts of DDoS attacks, and solutions for mitigation are discussed in detail. The presented review work compares Intrusion Detection and Prevention models for mitigating DDoS attacks and focuses on Intrusion Detection models. Furthermore, the classification of Intrusion Detection Systems, different anomaly detection techniques, different Intrusion Detection System models based on datasets, various machine learning and deep learning techniques for data pre-processing and malware detection has been discussed. In the end, a broader perspective has been envisioned while discussing research challenges, its proposed solutions, and future visions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3073408","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9405669","Anomaly detection;DDoS attacks;deep learning;machine learning;Internet of Things;intrusion detection system","Internet of Things;Security;Intrusion detection;Denial-of-service attack;Systematics;Deep learning;Machine vision","computer network security;Internet of Things;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence)","intrusion detection system models;future visions;security challenges;healthcare;IoT technology;security requirements;security management;IoT devices;IoT vulnerable;security attacks;security risks;upcoming challenges;different security issues;IoT layers;application layer;Service attacks;DDoS attacks;Intrusion Detection models;Intrusion Detection Systems;different anomaly detection techniques","","2","","170","CCBY","15 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

IoT technology finds applications in a broad spectrum of areas such as homes, health, water and sanitation, transportation, and environmental monitoring. However, the endless opportunities and benefits of IoT come with many security challenges due to the reduced computation, communication, storage, and energy capabilities of the IoT smart devices. Several computationally lightweight cryptographic protocols exist for these resource-constrained IoT smart devices. However, lightweight solutions render the resource-rich ends of the IoT systems (e.g., edge, fog, or cloud modes) vulnerable as nodes at those ends have the capacity for computationally heavier cryptographic protocols, and they operate in relatively more malicious environments. This asymmetric computational nature of IoT systems requires security protocols that can adapt to the resource availability at the node that they operate. This survey describes the IoT structure, computational capabilities of the devices at the end, edge, fog, and cloud platforms, and classifies existing lightweight cryptographic protocols. The comparative analysis of the existing lightweight cryptographic solutions along with their advantages, drawbacks, and vulnerabilities highlights the need for elastic cryptographic protocols which are capable of adapting to the asymmetric capabilities of the different nodes in IoT systems.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3026493","Ph.D. stipend scholarship from CSIRO Data61(grant numbers:50050661); International Tuition Fee scholarship from School of Science, RMIT; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9205259","Asymmetric devices;Internet of Things (IoT);IoT architecture;IoT framework;IoT layers;IoT models for lightweight protocol;lightweight cryptographic protocols;resource constrained;security challenges","Protocols;Cryptography;Internet of Things;Smart devices;Pacemakers","computer network security;cryptographic protocols;Internet of Things","IoT-constrained devices;IoT technology;computationally lightweight cryptographic protocols;resource-constrained IoT smart devices;IoT systems;security protocols;IoT structure;computational capabilities;elastic cryptographic protocols","","2","","225","IEEE","24 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For long service time and low maintenance cost, WSNs require adaptive and robust methods to address data exchange, topology formulation, resource and power optimization, sensing coverage and object detection, and security challenges. In these problems, sensor nodes are used to make optimized decisions from a set of accessible strategies to achieve design goals. This survey reviews numerous applications of the Markov decision process (MDP) framework, a powerful decision-making tool to develop adaptive algorithms and protocols for WSNs.
