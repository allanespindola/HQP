"Engineering Statistical Behaviors for Attacking and Defending Covert Channels","V. Crespi; G. Cybenko; A.

The main new result is our demonstration of how to use a behavior's or process' <i>k</i>-order statistics to build a stochastic process that has the same <i>k</i>-order stationary statistics but possesses different, deliberately designed, (<i>k</i>+1) -order statistics if desired. Such a model realizes a “complexification” of the process or behavior which a defender can use to monitor whether an attacker is shaping the behavior. We also describe a source coding technique that respects the <i>k</i> -order statistics, including entropy which is a first order statistic for example, of a process while encoding information covertly, and we show how to achieve optimizing information rates. Although the main results and examples are stated in terms of behavioral anomaly detection for covert channels, the techniques are more generally applicable to behavioral anomaly analysis. One fundamental consequence of these results is that certain types of behavioral anomaly detection techniques come down to an arms race in the sense that the advantage goes to the party that has more computing resources applied to the problem.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2012.2237378","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6400212","Behavioral anomaly detection;covert channels;exfiltration;probabilistic automata;cognitive attack;steganalysis","Entropy;Delay;Hidden Markov models;Probability;Encoding;Stochastic processes","channel coding;computer network security;higher order statistics;source coding;telecommunication traffic","engineering statistical behaviors;covert channel attack;covert channel defending;behavioral anomaly detection method;network traffic analysis;process k-order statistics;behavior k-order statistics;stochastic process;k-order stationary statistics;process complexification;source coding technique;entropy;first-order statistic;encoding information;optimizing information rates","","13","","49","","1 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The major concern is with brownfield IIoT systems since they have legacy edge systems that are not fully prepared to integrate with IoT technologies. Various existing security solutions can detect and mitigate such attacks but are often ineffective due to the heterogeneous and distributed nature of the IIoT systems and their interoperability demands. Consequently, developing new detection solutions is essential. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel targeted ransomware detection model tailored for IIoT edge systems. It uses Asynchronous Peer-to-Peer Federated Learning (AP2PFL) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques as a targeted ransomware detection algorithm. The proposed model consists of two modules: 1) Data Purifying Module (DPM) aims to refine and reconstruct a valuable and robust representation of data based on Contractive Denoising Auto-Encoder (CDAE), and 2) Diagnostic and Decision Module (DDM) is used to identify targeted ransomware and its stages based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Batch Normalization (BN). The main strengths of this proposed model include: 1) each edge gateway’s modules work cooperatively with its neighbors in an asynchronous manner and without a third party, 2) it deals with both homogeneous and heterogeneous data, and 3) it is robust against evasion attacks. An exhaustive set of experiments on three datasets prove the high effectiveness of the proposed model in detecting targeted ransomware (known and unknown attacks) in brownfield IIoT and the superiority over the state-of-the-art models.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124634","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9597509","Edge system;IIoT;federated learning;detection;targeted ransomware","Ransomware;Industrial Internet of Things;Logic gates;Feature extraction;Data models;Image edge detection;Cryptography","","","","","","43","CCBY","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, fully intelligent network orchestration and management for providing innovative services will only be realized in Beyond 5G (B5G) networks. To this end, we envisage that the sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks will be driven by on-demand self-reconfiguration to ensure a many-fold increase in the network performance and service types. The increasingly stringent performance requirements of emerging networks may finally trigger the deployment of some interesting new technologies, such as large intelligent surfaces, electromagnetic-orbital angular momentum, visible light communications, and cell-free communications, to name a few. Our vision for 6G is a massively connected complex network capable of rapidly responding to the users' service calls through real-time learning of the network state as described by the network edge (e.g., base-station locations and cache contents), air interface (e.g., radio spectrum and propagation channel), and the user-side (e.g., battery-life and locations). The multi-state, multi-dimensional nature of the network state, requiring the real-time knowledge, can be viewed as a quantum uncertainty problem. In this regard, the emerging paradigms of machine learning (ML), quantum computing (QC), and quantum ML (QML) and their synergies with communication networks can be considered as core 6G enablers. Considering these potentials, starting with the 5G target services and enabling technologies, we provide a comprehensive review of the related state of the art in the domains of ML (including deep learning), QC, and QML and identify their potential benefits, issues, and use cases for their applications in the B5G networks. Subsequently, we propose a novel QC-assisted and QML-based framework for 6G communication networks while articulating its challenges and potential enabling technologies at the network infrastructure, network edge, air interface, and user end.

This situation often requires to establish trust relationships between a user and a smart object for their secure interactions, but without the presence of prior interactions. In this work, we are interested in how a smart object can grant an access right to a human user in the absence of any prior knowledge in which some users may be malicious aiming to breach security goals of the IoT system. To solve this problem, we propose a trust-aware, role-based access control system, namely TARAS, which provides adaptive authorization to users based on dynamic trust estimation. In TARAS, for the initial trust establishment, we take a multidisciplinary approach by adopting the concept of I-sharing from psychology. The I-sharing follows the rationale that people with similar roles and traits are more likely to respond in a similar way. This theory provides a powerful tool to quickly establish trust between a smart object and a new user with no prior interactions. In addition, TARAS can adaptively filter malicious users out by revoking their access rights based on adaptive, dynamic trust estimation. Our experimental results show that the proposed TARAS mechanism can maximize system integrity in terms of correctly detecting malicious or benign users while maximizing service availability to users particularly when the system is fine-tuned based on the identified optimal setting in terms of an optimal trust threshold.","2324-9013","978-1-5386-4388-4","10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2018.00022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8455890","trust-aware;adaptive systems;Internet-of-Things;access control;I-sharing","Authorization;Estimation;Permission;Dynamic scheduling;Adaptive systems","authorisation;Internet of Things;trusted computing","trust-aware role-based access control system;public Internet-of-Things;public IoT environments;trust relationships;security goals;IoT system;dynamic trust estimation;access rights;TARAS mechanism;system integrity;adaptive authorization;I-sharing;trust threshold","","4","","27","","6 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While UAV-aided networks can potentially find applications in many areas, a number of issues, particularly security, have not been readily addressed. The intrusion detection system is the most commonly used technique to detect attackers. In this paper, we focus on addressing two main issues within the context of intrusion detection and attacker ejection in UAV-aided networks, namely, activation of the intrusion monitoring process and attacker ejection. In fact, when a large number of nodes activate their monitoring processes, the incurred overhead can be substantial and, as a consequence, degrades the network performance. Therefore, a tradeoff between the intrusion detection rate and overhead is considered in this work. It is not always the best strategy to eject a node immediately when it exhibits a bad sign of malicious activities since this sign could be provisional (the node may switch to a normal behavior in the future) or be simply due to noise or unreliable communications. Thus, a dilemma between detection and false positive rates is taken into account in this paper. We propose to address these two security issues by a Bayesian game model in order to accurately detect attacks (i.e., high detection and low false positive rates) with a low overhead. Simulation results have demonstrated that our proposed security game framework does achieve reliable detection.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2016.2600370","European project Fuse-IT; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7549080","Bayesian game;intrusion detection system (IDS);intrusion ejection system (IES);unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs);vehicular networks","Unmanned aerial vehicles;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Games;Bayes methods","autonomous aerial vehicles;Bayes methods;game theory;mobile radio;telecommunication security","intrusion detection framework;intrusion ejection framework;lethal attacks;UAV-aided networks;Bayesian game-theoretic methodology;unmanned aerial vehicle development;ground network;end-to-end delay;data processing improvement;intrusion monitoring process;intrusion detection rate;microelectronics","","64","","34","IEEE","24 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As machine learning techniques become more mainstream, they are being applied to a wider range of application domains. These algorithms are now trusted to make critical decisions in secure and adversarial environments such as healthcare, fraud detection, and network security, in which mistakes can be incredibly costly. They are also a critical component to most modern autonomous systems. However, the data driven approach utilized by these machine learning methods can prove to be a weakness if the data on which the models rely are corrupted by either nefarious or accidental means. Models that utilize on-line learning or periodic retraining to learn new patterns and account for data distribution changes are particularly susceptible to corruption through model drift. In modeling this type of scenario, specially crafted data points are added to the training set over time to adversely influence the system, inducing model drift which leads to incorrect classifications. Our work is focused on exploring the resistance of various machine learning algorithms to such an approach. In this paper we present an experimental framework designed to measure the susceptibility of anomaly detection algorithms to model drift.

Compared with the misuse intrusion detection techniques based on pattern matching, the techniques based on model checking (MC) have a series of comparative advantages. However, the temporal logics employed in the existing latter techniques cannot express conveniently the complex attacks with synchronization phenomenon. To address this problem, we formalize a novel temporal logic language called attack signature description language (ASDL). On the basis of it, we put forward an ASDL model checking algorithm. Furthermore, we use ASDL programs, which can be considered as temporal logic formulas, to describe attack signatures, and employ other ASDL programs to create an audit log. As a result, the ASDL model checking algorithm can be presented for automatically verifying whether or not the latter programs satisfy the formulas, that is, whether or not the audit log coincides with the attack signatures. Thus, an intrusion detection algorithm based on ASDL is obtained. The case studies and simulations show that the new method can find coordinated chop-chop attacks.","2329-9274","","10.1109/JAS.2017.7510754","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8232593","","Intrusion detection;Model checking;Synchronization;Wireless networks;Pattern matching;Automata","pattern matching;program verification;security of data;temporal logic","audit log;ASDL model checking algorithm;attack signatures;intrusion detection algorithm;coordinated chop-chop attacks;wireless networks;cable networks;pattern matching;U+0028 MC U+0029;ASDL programs;temporal logic formulas;temporal logic language;attack signature description language;U+0028 ASDL;cyberattacks;network security technique","","4","","","","20 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, classification research contains several experiments with different conditions such as datasets and methodologies. This study aims to benchmark the algorithms to the same dataset and features to equally measure all performances. Using a dataset that contains the typing rhythm of 51 subjects, we implement and evaluate 15 classifiers measured by F1-measure, which is the harmonic mean of a false-negative identification rate and false-positive identification rate. We also develop a methodology to process the typing data. By considering a case in which the model will reject the outsider, we tested the algorithms on an open set. Additionally, we tested different parameters in random forest and k nearest neighbors classifications to achieve better results and explore the cause of their high performance. We also tested the dataset on one-class classification and explained the results of the experiment. The top-performing classifier achieves an F1-measure rate of 92% while using the normalized typing data of 50 subjects to train and the remaining data to test.

However, adversarial examples created by adding a little noise to an original sample can lead to misclassification by a DNN. Conventional studies on adversarial examples have focused on ways of causing misclassification by a DNN by modulating the entire image. However, in some cases, a restricted adversarial example may be required in which only certain parts of the image are modified rather than the entire image and that results in misclassification by the DNN. For example, when the placement of a road sign has already been completed, an attack may be required that will change only a specific part of the sign, such as by placing a sticker on it, to cause misidentification of the entire image. As another example, an attack may be required that causes a DNN to misinterpret images according to a minimal modulation of the outside border of the image. In this paper, we propose a new restricted adversarial example that modifies only a restricted area to cause misclassification by a DNN while minimizing distortion from the original sample. It can also select the size of the restricted area. We used the CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets to evaluate the performance. We measured the attack success rate and distortion of the restricted adversarial example while adjusting the size, shape, and position of the restricted area. The results show that the proposed scheme generates restricted adversarial examples with a 100% attack success rate in a restricted area of the whole image (approximately 14% for CIFAR10 and 1.07% for ImageNet) while minimizing the distortion distance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2915971","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:2017R1A2B4006026); Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion(grant numbers:2016-0-00173); Security Technologies for Financial Fraud Prevention on Fintech; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8710245","Deep neural network (DNN);adversarial example;machine learning;evasion attack;restricted area","Distortion;Distortion measurement;Neural networks;Shape;Training;Speech recognition;Rate distortion theory","image classification;neural nets;speech recognition","DNN;restricted adversarial example;speech recognition;deep neural networks;evasion attack;image recognition","","3","","30","OAPA","9 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This closed-design paradigm has limited the capability of the switches to proprietary implementations which are hard-coded by vendors, inducing a lengthy, costly, and inflexible process. Recently, data plane programmability has attracted significant attention from both the research community and the industry, permitting operators and programmers in general to run customized packet processing functions. This open-design paradigm is paving the way for an unprecedented wave of innovation and experimentation by reducing the time of designing, testing, and adopting new protocols; enabling a customized, top-down approach to develop network applications; providing granular visibility of packet events defined by the programmer; reducing complexity and enhancing resource utilization of the programmable switches; and drastically improving the performance of applications that are offloaded to the data plane. Despite the impressive advantages of programmable data plane switches and their importance in modern networks, the literature has been missing a comprehensive survey. To this end, this paper provides a background encompassing an overview of the evolution of networks from legacy to programmable, describing the essentials of programmable switches, and summarizing their advantages over Software-defined Networking (SDN) and legacy devices.

In the recent past, threats due to hardware Trojan (HT) in the integrated circuits (IC) have become a serious concern, which affects IoT edge devices (IoT-ED). In this paper, the possibility of the IoT-ED with embedded HT that can cause serious security, privacy, and availability problems to the IoT based Home Area Network (HAN) has been discussed. Conventional network attack detection techniques work at the network protocol layers, whereas IoT-ED with HT can lead to the peculiar manifestation of attack at the physical and/or firmware level. On the other hand, in the IC design, most of the HT-based attack detection techniques require design time intervention, which is expensive for many of the IoT-ED and cannot guarantee 100% immunity. The argument in this paper is that the health of modern IoT-ED requires a final line of defense against possible HT-based attacks that goes undetected during IC design and test. The approach is to utilize power profiling (PP) and network traffic (NT) data without intervening into the IC design to detect malicious activity in HAN. The proposed technique is to effectively identify multiple attacks concurrently and to differentiate between different types of attacks. The IoT-ED behaviors for five different types of random attacks have been studied, including covert channel, DoS, ARQ, power depletion, and impersonation attacks. Data fusion has been leveraged by combining the PP and NT data and is able to detect, without design time intervention, each of the five attacks individually with up to 99% accuracy. Moreover, the proposed technique can also detect all the attacks concurrently with 92% accuracy. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first work where multiple HT based attacks are concurrently detected in IoT-ED without requiring any design time intervention.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2975016","FP7 Information and Communication Technologies(grant numbers:21N206); United Arab Emirates University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9003413","Internet of Things;hardware security;home area network;hardware Trojan;machine learning;power profile;ARQ attack;DoS attack","Security;Hardware;Integrated circuits;Privacy;Trojan horses;Image edge detection;Data integration","automatic repeat request;computer network security;distributed processing;firmware;home computing;integrated circuit design;Internet of Things;invasive software;protocols","ARQ;DoS;covert channel;NT data;network traffic data;power profiling;network protocol layers;HAN;home area network;integrated circuits;privacy preservation;fusion-on-field security;HT-based attack detection techniques;conventional network attack detection techniques work;Internet of Things devices;hardware Trojan attacks;IoT edge devices;multiple HT based attacks;impersonation attacks;random attacks;IoT-ED behaviors;IC design","","1","","59","CCBY","19 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Instead, we introduce a compelling GAN-based anomaly detection partially surrounded with User Initial information features (UI-GAN). Although GAN-based anomaly detection methods have been previously proposed, each model has its adequate suitability for each anomaly detection application. Therefore, this study firstly evaluates suitable GAN-based anomaly detection models for fall detection from among nine recently proposed GAN-based models. From UI-GAN, performance improvements are observed in the fall detection when using the UI information. To objectively demonstrate the competitive performance of UI-GAN, we compare it with eight other recently presented fall detection studies and have observed that it leads to better results. Lastly, since the target application in this study is the use of UI-GAN with a wearable device, the sufficiently satisfied latency of UI-GAN on the smartwatch is estimated.

As the adversaries are becoming more skilled and organized, traditional rule based detection systems have been proved to be quite ineffective against the continuously evolving cyber attacks. Consequently, security researchers are focusing on applying machine learning techniques and big data analytics to defend against cyber attacks. Over the recent years, several anomaly detection systems have been claimed to be quite successful against the sophisticated cyber attacks including the previously unseen zero-day attacks. But often, these systems do not consider the adversary's adaptive attacking behavior for bypassing the detection procedure. As a result, deploying these systems in active real-world scenarios fails to provide significant benefits in the presence of intelligent adversaries that are carefully manipulating the attack vectors. In this work, we analyze the adversarial impact on anomaly detection models that are built upon centroid-based clustering from game-theoretic aspect and propose adversarial anomaly detection technique for these models. The experimental results show that our game-theoretic anomaly detection models can withstand attacks more effectively compared to the traditional models.","","978-1-5386-2659-7","10.1109/IRI.2018.00009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8424680","Anomaly Detection;Adversarial Machine Learning;Clustering;Mimicry Attack","Anomaly detection;Machine learning;Data models;Cyberattack;Robustness;Games","Big Data;data analysis;game theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;security of data","sophisticated cyber attacks;zero-day attacks;intelligent adversaries;attack vectors;adversarial impact;adversarial anomaly detection technique;game-theoretic anomaly detection models;unprecedented rate;skilled rule;organized rule;traditional rule;machine learning techniques;big data analytics;anomaly detection systems;cyber attacks;centroid-based clustering","","1","","31","","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Modern vehicles are generally equipped with many (dozens of, or even hundreds of) electronic and intelligent devices so that drivers can gain a more comfortable driving experience. Protecting this increasingly complex vehicle ecosystem can be an arduous task, especially as the proliferation of data across different connected devices makes them more vulnerable than ever before. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been found extremely helpful in monitoring CAN traffic and detecting potential intrusions. The paper proposes a novel and robust intrusion detection mechanism for in-vehicle CAN network by using spatiotemporal information enabled time series prediction. The proposed IDS analyzes the CAN traffic generated by the in-vehicle network in real time and identifies the abnormal state of the vehicle practically. Our model utilizes substantially both the time and space information of the instructions information sent by the ECUs in detecting the intrusions and thus outperforms the classical Long Short Term Memory model. The intrusion detection mechanism provides strong robustness in the sense that it can perform fast online learning of packet features (while the vehicle is running) to implement new protocols for intrusion detection (enabling to capture the fresh state of the vehicle) if the underlying communication protocol of the vehicle has changed. In particular, the IDS can evolve by itself as exotic environment factors (such as road conditions, atmospheric conditions, etc.) change and manage its model by itself in a self-organized way. Experiment results demonstrate the performance of the model and the effectiveness against both known and unknown attacks.","","978-1-7281-2058-4","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2019.00193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8855559","in-vehicle network, intrusion detection systems, time series prediction","Intrusion detection;Data models;Protocols;Roads;Real-time systems;Machine learning;Correlation","automotive electronics;controller area networks;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile radio;protocols;security of data;telecommunication traffic;time series","in-vehicle network;Controller Area Network;CAN bus;ECUs;comfortable driving experience;intrusion detection systems;CAN traffic;time series prediction;vehicle bus standard;intrusion detection mechanism;Long Short Term Memory model;vehicle ecosystem","","1","","20","","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is done only if the new networking solution is fully monitored, secured and can provide rapid revenues (short Return of Investment). For example, the NDN (Named Data Networking) solution is admitted as promising but still uncertain, thus making network operators reluctant to deploy it. Having a flexible environment would allow network operators to initiate the deployment of new network solutions at low cost and low risk. The virtualization techniques, appeared a few years ago, can help to provide such a flexible networking architecture. However, with it, emerge monitoring and security issues which should be solved. In this paper, we present our secure virtualized networking environment to deploy new functions and protocol stacks in the network, with a specific focus on the NDN use-case as one of the potential Future Internet technology. As strong requirements for a network operator, we then focus on monitoring and security components, highlighting where and how they can be deployed and used.

Such signals contain digital artifacts that are unique, which may act as an identifier of a particular device component e.g., its CPU, or the entire device if one chooses to take into account a combination of multiple such components. In real-life scenarios, this “bio-metrical” fingerprinting of hardware has to be conducted only once, possibly as part of an initial device configuration process with minimum additional maintenance time and cost, by the network administrators. At a subsequent stage, devices can get “authenticated” by comparing their newly emitted signals against the preexisting database during routine checks. The experimental results attest that the proposed approach can effectively protect a network against unrecognized potentially rogue devices posing as benign or malicious substitutions of hardware components at the chip level with near-perfect accuracy.

Every device in this network is a cyber physical system that can independently get commands, do operations, move in the space, and it becomes possible to manage it remotely. For its security sensitivity, this ITC system is required to be protected with an adequate and effective intrusion detection mechanism.

By exploiting the vulnerabilities of cheap and insecure devices such as IP cameras, an attacker can create hundreds of thousands of zombie devices and then launch massive volume attacks to take down any target. For example, in 2016, a record large-scale DDoS attack launched by millions of Mirai-injected IP cameras and smart printers blocked the accessibility of several high-profile websites. To date, the state-of-the-art defense systems against such attacks rely mostly on pre-defined features extracted from the entire flows or signatures. The feature definitions are manual, and it would be too late to block a malicious flow after extracting the flow features. In this work, we present an effective anomaly traffic detection mechanism, namely D-PACK, which consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and an unsupervised deep learning model (e.g., Autoencoder) for auto-profiling the traffic patterns and filtering abnormal traffic. Notably, D-PACK inspects only the first few bytes of the first few packets in each flow for early detection. Our experimental results show that, by examining just the first two packets in each flow, D-PACK still performs with nearly 100% accuracy, while features an extremely low false-positive rate, e.g., 0.83%. The design can inspire the emerging efforts towards online anomaly detection systems that feature reducing the volume of processed packets and blocking malicious flows in time.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2973023","Advanced Institute of Manufacturing With High-Tech Innovations (AIM-HI) from the Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 107-2218-E-194-014,108-2221-E-194-022-MY3,MOST 108-2221-E-194-019-MY3); Taiwan Information Security Center, National Sun Yat-sen University; TWISC@NSYSU; TNU-University of Information and Communication Technology, Vietnam; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8990084","IoT security;anomaly detection;convolutional neural network;autoendcoder;online DL-based anomaly detection","Anomaly detection;Feature extraction;Deep learning;Internet of Things;Buildings;Telecommunication traffic;IP networks","computer network security;convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;IP networks;telecommunication traffic;unsupervised learning;Web sites","connected world;insecure devices;zombie devices;massive volume attacks;large-scale DDoS attack;Mirai-injected IP cameras;smart printers;state-of-the-art defense systems;predefined features;feature definitions;malicious flow;effective anomaly traffic detection mechanism;convolutional neural networks;unsupervised deep learning model;traffic patterns;online anomaly detection systems;processed packets;D-PACK;abnormal traffic filtering;autoprofiling;high-profile Web sites;early network traffic anomaly detection","","10","","32","CCBY","10 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The interaction between the network and the smart jammer has been modeled as an infinite-horizon general-sum (nonzero-sum) Bayesian game with asymmetric information, with the network being the uninformed player. Although significant work has been done on optimal strategy computation and control of information revelation of the informed player in repeated asymmetric information games, it has been limited to zero-sum games with perfect monitoring. Recent progress on the strategy computation of the uninformed player is also limited to zero-sum games with perfect monitoring and is focused on expected payoff formulations. Since the proposed formulation is a general-sum game with imperfect monitoring, existing formulations cannot be leveraged for estimating true state of nature (the jammer type). Hence, a threat-based mechanism is proposed for the uninformed player (the network) to estimate the informed player's type (jammer type). The proposed mechanism helps the network resolve uncertainty about the state of nature (jammer type) so that it can compute a repeated-game strategy conditioned on its estimate. The proposed algorithm does not rely on the commonly assumed “full monitoring” premise and uses a combination of threat-based mechanism and nonparametric estimation to estimate the jammer type. In addition, it requires no explicit feedback from the network users, nor does it rely on a specific distribution (e.g., Gaussian) of test statistic. It is shown that the proposed algorithm's estimation performance is quite robust under realistic modeling and observational constraints, despite all the aforementioned challenges.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2017.2672682","U.S. AFOSR/MURI(grant numbers:FA9550-10-1-0573); U.S. ARO(grant numbers:W911NF-09-1-0553); King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7862285","Bayesian games with asymmetric information;Long-term evolution (LTE)/LTE-Advanced (LTE-A);non-parametric estimation;smart jamming;threat-based mechanism","Games;Jamming;Monitoring;Bayes methods;Game theory;Long Term Evolution;Estimation","game theory;jamming;Long Term Evolution","jammer-type estimation;LTE-A;smart jammer repeated game;long-term evolution-advanced networks;infinite-horizon general-sum Bayesian game;threat-based mechanism;repeated-game strategy","","13","","43","IEEE","22 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present a novel approach for automatically creating introspection tools for security applications with minimal human effort. By analyzing dynamic traces of small, in-guest programs that compute the desired introspection information, we can produce new programs that retrieve the same information from outside the guest virtual machine. We demonstrate the efficacy of our techniques by automatically generating 17 programs that retrieve security information across 3 different operating systems, and show that their functionality is unaffected by the compromise of the guest system.

The SDN controller exercises centralized control over network software, and in doing so, it can monitor and respond to malicious traffic for network protection. This paper proposes a threat-aware system based on machine-learning for timely detection and response against network intrusion in SDN. Our proposed system consists of data preprocessing for feature selection, predictive data modeling for machine-learning and anomaly detection, and decision making for intrusion response in SDN. Due to the time-critical nature of SDN, we propose a practical approach utilizing machine-learning techniques to protect against network intrusion and reduce uncertainty in decision-making outcomes. The maliciousness of most uncertain network traffic subsets is evaluated with selected significant feature sets. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves high performance and significantly reduces uncertainty in the decision process with a small number of feature sets. The results help the SDN controller to properly react against known or unknown attacks that cannot be prevented by signature-based network intrusion detection systems.","","978-1-5090-2991-4","10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038436","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8038436","","Intrusion detection;Data models;Predictive models;Routing;Real-time systems;Classification algorithms;Systems architecture","computer network security;data protection;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);software defined networking;telecommunication control","machine-learning based threat-aware system;software defined networks;network architecture;control plane decoupling;data plane;unprecedented programmability;network control;centralized control;network software;malicious traffic;network protection;SDN network intrusion;data preprocessing;feature selection;predictive data modeling;anomaly detection;decision making;SDN intrusion response;feature sets;signature-based network intrusion detection systems","","8","","63","","18 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite tremendous advances in cryptography, physical-layer security and authentication, information attacks, both passive such as eavesdropping, and active such as unauthorized data injection, continue to thwart the reliable functioning of networked systems. In systems with joint cyber-physical functionality, the ability of an adversary to monitor transmitted information or introduce false information can lead to sensitive user data being leaked or result in critical damages to the underlying physical system. This paper investigates two broad challenges in information security in cyber-physical systems (CPSs): preventing retrieval of internal physical system information through monitored external cyber flows, and limiting the modification of physical system functioning through compromised cyber flows. A rigorous analytical framework grounded on information-theoretic security is developed to study these challenges in a general stochastic control system abstraction-a theoretical building block for CPSs-with the objectives of quantifying the fundamental tradeoffs between information security and physical system performance, and through the process, designing provably secure controller policies. Recent results are presented that establish the theoretical basis for the framework, in addition to practical applications in timing analysis of anonymous systems, and demand response systems in a smart electricity grid.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2015.2466089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7270416","Cyber-physical systems;entropy;information security;stochastic control","Control systems;Stochastic processes;Information security;Monitoring;Smart meters;Communication system security;Security;Telecommunication services;Physical layer","control engineering computing;power engineering computing;power system control;power system security;security of data;smart power grids;stochastic processes;stochastic systems","information-theoretic security;stochastic control system;cyber-physical architecture;cyber-physical system;CPS;networked controller;controller policy security;anonymous system timing analysis;demand response system;smart electricity grid","","14","","68","IEEE","16 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As market forces move increasingly towards Internet and VoIP communications, there is proportional increase in telephony denial of service (TDoS) attacks. Like denial of service (DoS) attacks, TDoS attacks seek to disrupt business and commerce by directing a flood of anomalous traffic towards key communication servers. In this work, we focus on a new class of anomalous traffic that exhibits a mimicry TDoS attack. Such an attack can be launched by crafting malformed messages with small changes from normal ones. We show that such malicious messages easily bypass intrusion detection systems (IDS) and degrade the goodput of the server drastically by forcing it to parse the message looking for the needed token. Our approach is not to parse at all; instead, we use multiple classifier systems (MCS) to exploit the strength of multiple learners to predict the true class of a message with high probability (98.50% ≤ p ≤ 99.12%). We proceed systematically by first formulating an optimization problem of picking the minimum number of classifiers such that their combination yields the optimal classification performance. Next, we analytically bound the maximum performance of such a system and empirically demonstrate that it is possible to attain close to the maximum theoretical performance across varied datasets. Finally, guided by our analysis we construct an MCS appliance that demonstrates superior classification accuracy with O(1) runtime complexity across varied datasets.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2015.2459603","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163619","SIP;machine learning;classification;SIP;machine learning;classification;anomaly;multiple classifier systems;mimicry attacks","Servers;Protocols;Grammar;Degradation;Computer crime;Electronic mail;Internet","computational complexity;computer network security;Internet telephony;optimisation;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","mimicry attacks mitigation;session initiation protocol;US national academies of science board;Internet communications infrastructure;voice-over-IP communications infrastructure;VoIP;US economic growth;telephony denial of service attacks;anomalous traffic;communication servers;mimicry TDoS attack;intrusion detection systems;IDS;multiple classifier systems;MCS;optimization problem;MCS appliance;runtime complexity","","7","1","48","IEEE","21 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The presence of anomalies prevents practical application of the electrospun nanofibrous material in nanotechnology. Hence, the automatic monitoring and quality control of nanomaterials is a relevant challenge in the context of Industry 4.0. In this paper, a novel automatic classification system for homogenous (anomaly-free) and non-homogenous (with defects) nanofibers is proposed. The inspection procedure aims at avoiding direct processing of the redundant full SEM image. Specifically, the image to be analyzed is first partitioned into subimages (nanopatches) that are then used as input to a hybrid unsupervised and supervised machine learning system. In the first step, an autoencoder (AE) is trained with unsupervised learning to generate a code representing the input image with a vector of relevant features. Next, a multilayer perceptron (MLP), trained with supervised learning, uses the extracted features to classify non-homogenous nanofiber (NH-NF) and homogenous nanofiber (H-NF) patches. The resulting novel AE-MLP system is shown to outperform other standard machine learning models and other recent state-of-the-art techniques, reporting accuracy rate up to 92.5%. In addition, the proposed approach leads to model complexity reduction with respect to other deep learning strategies such as convolutional neural networks (CNN). The encouraging performance achieved in this benchmark study can stimulate the application of the proposed scheme in other challenging industrial manufacturing tasks.","2329-9274","","10.1109/JAS.2020.1003387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9205684","","Nanomaterials;Feature extraction;Scanning electron microscopy;Machine learning;Polymers;Industries;Production","automatic optical inspection;convolutional neural nets;electrospinning;feature extraction;image classification;multilayer perceptrons;nanofibres;production engineering computing;quality control;scanning electron microscopy;supervised learning;unsupervised learning","automatic classification system;electrospun nanofiber;electrospinning process;scanning electron microscope images;structural defects;electrospun nanofibrous material;automatic monitoring;inspection procedure;redundant full SEM image;unsupervised learning;supervised learning;AE-MLP system;deep learning;industrial manufacturing tasks;nanomaterials;nanotechnology;quality control;Industry 4.0;nonhomogenous nanofibres;homogenous nanofibres;nanopatches;hybrid unsupervised and supervised machine learning system;multilayer perceptron;feature extraction;model complexity reduction;convolutional neural networks","","3","","","","24 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the very fast move and high dynamic in VANETs, it is important to quickly ascertain the reliability of information. Although intrusion detection system (IDS) has been proposed as a reliable approach to protect VANETs against attacks, its overhead is serious, which spends too much time on detection, especially when the number of vehicles increases. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel filter model based on a hidden generalized mixture transition distribution model (HgMTD) in VANETs, called FM-HgMTD, which can quickly filter the messages from neighboring vehicles so as to reduce the overhead and detection time.

One of the methods malware writers use for hiding their creations is executable packing. Packing consists of encrypting or hiding the real code of the executable in such a way that it is decrypted or unhidden in its execution. Widespread solutions to this issue first try to identify the packer used and next apply the corresponding unpacking routine for each packing algorithm. As it happens with malware obfuscations, this approach fails to detect new and custom packers. Generic unpacking is a technique that has been proposed to solve this issue. These methods usually execute the binary in a contained environment or sandbox to retrieve the real code of the packed executable. Because these approaches incur in a high performance overhead, a filter step is required to determine whether an executable is packed or not. Supervised machine-learning approaches have been proposed to handle this filtering step. However, the usefulness of supervised learning is far to be complete because it requires a high amount of packed and not packed executables to be identified and labelled previously. In this paper, we propose a new method for packed executable detection that adopts a well-known semi-supervised learning approach to reduce the labelling requirements of completely supervised approaches. We performed an empirical validation demonstrating that the labelling efforts are lower than when supervised learning is used while the system maintains high accuracy rates.","","978-1-4577-0460-4","10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6060027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6060027","","Malware;Entropy;Accuracy;Software;Feature extraction;Labeling;Detectors","cryptography;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence)","semisupervised machine learning;packed executable detection;malware;executable packing;generic unpacking","","5","","28","","27 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, the state estimation process for monitoring AV dynamics, in presence of CP attacks, is analyzed and a novel adversarial deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to maximize the robustness of AV dynamics control to CP attacks. The attacker's action and the AV's reaction to CP attacks are studied in a game-theoretic framework. In the formulated game, the attacker seeks to inject faulty data to AV sensor readings so as to manipulate the inter-vehicle optimal safe spacing and potentially increase the risk of AV accidents or reduce the vehicle flow on the roads. Meanwhile, the AV, acting as a defender, seeks to minimize the deviations of spacing so as to ensure robustness to the attacker's actions. Since the AV has no information about the attacker's action and due to the infinite possibilities for data value manipulations, each player uses long short term memory (LSTM) blocks to learn the expected spacing deviation resulting from its own action and feeds this deviation to a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. Then, the attacker's RL algorithm chooses the action which maximizes the spacing deviation, while the AV's RL algorithm seeks to find the optimal action that minimizes such deviation. Simulation results show that the proposed adversarial deep RL algorithm can improve the robustness of the AV dynamics control as it minimizes the intra-AV spacing deviation.","2153-0017","978-1-7281-0323-5","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569635","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569635","","Sensors;Heuristic algorithms;Security;Vehicle dynamics;Robustness;Cameras;Radar","control engineering computing;game theory;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;neural nets;safety;security of data;state estimation","data value manipulations;adversarial deep RL algorithm;AV dynamics control;intra-AV spacing deviation;autonomous vehicle systems;cyber-physical attacks;CP attacks;game-theoretic framework;AV sensor readings;inter-vehicle optimal safe spacing;AV accidents;adversarial deep reinforcement learning algorithm;state estimation process;long short term memory;LSTM blocks","","26","","24","","9 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is significant for numerous domain applications, such as industrial inspection, medical imaging, and security enforcement. There are two key research challenges associated with existing anomaly detection approaches: (1) many approaches perform well on low-dimensional problems however the performance on high-dimensional instances, such as images, is limited; (2) many approaches often rely on traditional supervised approaches and manual engineering of features, while the topic has not been fully explored yet using modern deep learning approaches, even when the well-label samples are limited. In this paper, we propose a One-for-all Image Anomaly Detection system (OIAD) based on disentangled learning using only clean samples. Our key insight is that the impact of small perturbation on the latent representation can be bounded for normal samples while anomaly images are usually outside such bounded intervals, referred to as structure consistency. We implement this idea and evaluate its performance for anomaly detection. Our experiments with three datasets show that OIAD can detect over 90% of anomalies while maintaining a low false alarm rate. It can also detect suspicious samples from samples labeled as clean, coincided with what humans would deem unusual.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-6926-2","10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9207434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9207434","Anomaly detection;deep learning;disentangled learning;latent representation;unsupervised learning","Image reconstruction;Anomaly detection;Decoding;Perturbation methods;Machine learning;Australia;Training","image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data","high-dimensional instances;deep learning;OIAD;disentangled learning;anomaly images;disentanglement learning;anomalous patterns;industrial inspection;medical imaging;security enforcement;low-dimensional problems;one-for-all image anomaly detection;latent representation","","1","","26","","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traffic encryption has become extremely common, and the quick proliferation of mobile apps and their simple distribution and update have created a specifically challenging scenario for traffic classification and its uses, especially network-security related ones. The recent rise of Deep Learning (DL) has responded to this challenge, by providing a solution to the time-consuming and human-limited handcrafted feature design, and better clas-sification performance. The counterpart of the advantages is the lack of interpretability of these black-box approaches, limiting or preventing their adoption in contexts where the reliability of results, or interpretability of polices is necessary. To cope with these limitations, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques have seen recent intensive research. Along these lines, our work applies XAI-based techniques (namely, Deep SHAP) to interpret the behavior of a state-of-the-art multimodal DL traffic classifier. As opposed to common results seen in XAI, we aim at a global interpretation, rather than sample-based ones. The results quantify the importance of each modality (payload- or header-based), and of specific subsets of inputs (e.g., TLS SNI and TCP Window Size) in determining the classification outcome, down to per-class (viz. application) level.

Often, however, these attacks leave visible artifacts in the images that can be visually detected and weaken the efficacy of the attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for hiding backdoor and poisoning attacks. Our approach builds on a recent class of attacks against image scaling. These attacks enable manipulating images such that they change their content when scaled to a specific resolution. By combining poisoning and image-scaling attacks, we can conceal the trigger of backdoors as well as hide the overlays of clean-label poisoning. Furthermore, we consider the detection of image-scaling attacks and derive an adaptive attack. In an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy. First, we show that backdoors and poisoning work equally well when combined with image-scaling attacks. Second, we demonstrate that current detection defenses against image-scaling attacks are insufficient to uncover our manipulations. Overall, our work provides a novel means for hiding traces of manipulations, being applicable to different poisoning approaches.","","978-1-7281-9346-5","10.1109/SPW50608.2020.00024","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(grant numbers:EXC 2092 CASA - 390781972,RI 2469/3-1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9283824","Poisoning;Backdoor;Deep Neural Network","Privacy;Image resolution;Machine vision;Conferences;Neural networks;Machine learning;Security","deep learning (artificial intelligence);image processing","image-scaling attacks;backdoor attacks;poisoning attacks;adaptive attack;neural networks;machine-learning;vision systems;clean-label poisoning","","","","21","","18 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional FDI attacks mostly require adversaries to know the full system topology, i.e., hundreds or thousands of lines and buses, while having unpredictable consequences. In this paper, we present a new class of FDI attacks directly against individual Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), which are ubiquitous in power generation and distribution. Our attack allows the adversary to have only partial information about the victim subsystem, and produces a predictable malicious result. Our attack tool analyzes an I/O trace of the compromised PLCs to produce a set of inputs to achieve the desired PLC outputs, i.e., the system behavior. It proceeds in two steps. First, our tool constructs a model of the PLC's internal logic from the I/O traces. Second, it searches for a set of inputs that cause the model to calculate the desired malicious behavior. We evaluate our tool against a set of representative control systems and show that it is a practical threat against insecure sensor configurations.","","978-1-4799-4934-2","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2014.7007754","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7007754","","Automata;Vectors;Control systems;State estimation;Power systems;Servers;Process control","power distribution control;power generation control;power system security","controller-aware false data injection;physical process;false data injection attacks;forged sensor measurements;misguiding control;full system topology;power generation;power distribution;victim subsystem;predictable malicious result;attack tool analyzis;representative control systems","","6","","30","","15 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The role of Intrusion Detection System within security architecture is to improve a security level by identification of all malicious and also suspicious events that could be observed in computer or network system. One of the more specific research areas related to intrusion detection is anomaly detection. Anomaly-based intrusion detection in networks refers to the problem of finding untypical events in the observed network traffic that do not conform to the expected normal patterns. It is assumed that everything that is untypical/anomalous could be dangerous and related to some security events. To detect anomalies many security systems implements a classification or clustering algorithms. However, recent research proved that machine learning models might misclassify adversarial events, e.g. observations which were created by applying intentionally non-random perturbations to the dataset. Such weakness could increase of false negative rate which implies undetected attacks. This fact can lead to one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities of intrusion detection systems. The goal of the research performed was verification of the anomaly detection systems ability to resist this type of attack. This paper presents the preliminary results of tests taken to investigate existence of attack vector, which can use adversarial examples to conceal a real attack from being detected by intrusion detection systems.","","978-1-5386-5150-6","10.1109/INISTA.2018.8466271","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8466271","Anomaly detection;Adversarial examples;intrusion detection systems","Intrusion detection;Anomaly detection;Training;Classification algorithms;Biological neural networks;Neurons","security of data","anomaly detection systems ability;anomaly-based intrusion detection;intrusion detection systems vulnerability;attack vector;security events","","4","","14","","20 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In our problem setting, the patrol officers are assisted by the information collected by a network of binary proximity sensors installed in the building. We claim that learning even common movement sub-patterns that originate due to the constrained physical environment helps to find likely locations of intruders where each major location is instrumented using a sensor node. We use a series of binary detection events to infer likely future trajectories in a real-world building. For a given set of detectable nodes on the inferred future trajectories, we aim to find the optimal patrol dispatch node location with high exposure to intruders' future appearance using patrol officers in limited numbers, ideally fewer than the intruders. In order to prevent possible crime and perform responsive defense against potential intruders, our algorithm also tries to reduce the travel distance from patrols current positions to their dispatched positions at the same time. We validate our proposed scheme in terms of detection accuracy by varying the number of intruders, robustness against missing events, and responsiveness compared to a practical baseline counterpart through real-world system experiments.","","978-1-4673-9953-1","10.1109/INFOCOM.2016.7524369","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7524369","","Buildings;Surveillance;Trajectory;Mobile communication;Sensor systems;Security","building management systems;mobile computing;optimisation;probability;safety systems;surveillance;wireless sensor networks","proactive patrol dispatch surveillance system;mobile trajectory inference;intruder detection;binary proximity sensor;probability maximization;building automation","","","","27","","28 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"VidAnomaly: LSTM-Autoencoder-Based Adversarial Learning for One-Class Video Classification With Multiple Dynamic Images","S. Li; W.

However, one-class video classification is challenging. Due to the unavailability of abnormal samples, it is a cumbersome task to train an end-to-end deep supervised learning model. Meanwhile, video data representation is challenging because of the unstructured scheme of video contents. To represent video data with temporal and spatial information, we propose multiple dynamic images in our task because dynamic image encodes the temporal evolution of video frames and represents video contents at the level of the image pixels. Multiple dynamic images are viewed as the input sequence with temporal and spatial information and achieve dimension reduction of original video data. In this paper, we propose a LSTM-autoencoder-based adversarial learning model for one-class video classification (""VidAnomaly"") without abnormal samples in the training stage. Our architecture is composed of three sub-networks. LSTM-autoencoder network (R) learns the temporal dependence of the input sequence and reconstructs the input sequence for the discriminator network (D) to achieve adversarial learning. The novelty of the proposed model is that we add an additional LSTM-encoder network (A) to obtain the latent representation of the reconstructed sequence. Minimizing the distance between the two latent representations from R and A benefits the model to further capture the training data distribution because it forces the LSTM-autoencoder network to yield an essential representation of training samples in latent space. In the inference stage, for a given abnormal sample as the input, the model poorly reconstructs the input abnormal sample and the reconstruction error would be high because the proposed model is trained merely on normal samples and its parameters are only suitable for reconstructing normal samples. Based on this, we detect abnormal samples. The experimental results show that VidAnomaly learns the target class distribution effectively and is superior to other methods.","","978-1-7281-0858-2","10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006260","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9006260","Anomalous video detection;LSTM autoencoder;Adversarial learning;Dynamic image","Training;Image reconstruction;Task analysis;Anomaly detection;Training data;Data models;Image segmentation","feature extraction;image classification;image representation;image sequences;recurrent neural nets;supervised learning;video signal processing","deep supervised learning model;video data representation;abnormal videos;anomalous video detection;normal samples;input abnormal sample;training data distribution;LSTM-autoencoder network;one-class video classification;LSTM-autoencoder-based adversarial learning model;temporal information;video contents;video frames;multiple dynamic images;spatial information","","","","40","","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Shah",Snap Inc.,"2019 IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)","23 Jan 2020","2019","","","337","350","Online social platforms are constantly under attack by bad actors. These bad actors often leverage resources (e.g. IPs, devices) under their control to attack the platform by targeting various, vulnerable endpoints (e.g. account authentication, sybil account creation, friending) which may process millions to billions of events every day. As the scale and multifacetedness of malicious behaviors grows, and new endpoints and corresponding events are utilized and processed every day, the development of fast, extensible and schema-agnostic anomaly detection approaches to enable standardized protocols for different classes of events is critical. This is a notable challenge given that practitioners often have neither time nor means to custom-build anomaly detection services for each new event class and type. Moreover, labeled data is rarely available in such diverse settings, making unsupervised methods appealing. In this work, we study unsupervised, schema-agnostic characterization and detection of resource usage anomalies in social event logs. We propose an efficient algorithmic approach to this end, and evaluate it with promising results on several log datasets of different event classes. Specifically, our contributions include a) formulation: a novel articulation of the schema-agnostic anomaly detection problem for event logs, b) approach: we propose FARE (Finding Anomalous Resources and Events), which integrates online resource anomaly detection and offline event culpability identification components, and c) efficacy: demonstrated accuracy (100% precision@250 on two industrial datasets from the Snapchat platform, with ~50% anomalies previously uncaught by state-of-the-art production defenses), robustness (high precision/recall over suitable synthetic attacks and parameter choices) and scalability (near-linear in the number of events).","","978-1-7281-4493-1","10.1109/DSAA.2019.00049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8964216","misbehavior;event log;anomaly;schema agnostic;abuse","","data mining;security of data;social networking (online)","finding anomalous resources and events;Snapchat platform;offline event culpability identification components;online resource anomaly detection;schema-agnostic anomaly detection problem;log datasets;resource usage anomalies;schema-agnostic characterization;event class;custom-build anomaly detection services;sybil account creation;vulnerable endpoints;leverage resources;online social platforms;social event;parameter choices;suitable synthetic attacks","","","","40","","23 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Machine learning algorithms have been proposed for hindering cyber-attacks on CPSs, but the absence of labeled data from novel attacks makes their detection quite challenging. In this context, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a promising unsupervised approach to detect cyber-attacks by implicitly modeling the system. However, the detection of cyber-attacks on CPSs has strict latency requirements, since the attacks need to be stopped before the system is compromised. In this article, we propose FID-GAN, a novel fog-based, unsupervised intrusion detection system (IDS) for CPSs using GANs. The IDS is proposed for a fog architecture, which brings computation resources closer to the end nodes and thus contributes to meeting low-latency requirements. In order to achieve higher detection rates, the proposed architecture computes a reconstruction loss based on the reconstruction of data samples mapped to the latent space. Other works that follow a similar approach struggle with the time required to compute the reconstruction loss, which renders them impractical for latency constrained applications. We address this problem by training an encoder that accelerates the reconstruction loss computation. Experiments show that the proposed solution achieves higher detection rates and is at least 5.5 times faster than a baseline approach in the three studied data sets.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3024800","Tier 2 Canada Research Chair on the Next Generations of Wireless IoT Networks; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9199878","Cyber–physical systems (CPSs);generative adversarial networks (GANs);industrial security;intrusion detection systems (IDSs);machine learning","Gallium nitride;Computer architecture;Generators;Generative adversarial networks;Training;Sensors;Security","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","strict latency requirements;unsupervised intrusion detection system;CPS;GANs;higher detection rates;reconstruction loss;generative adversarial networks;fog environment;cyber-attacks cyber-physical systems;physical objects;novel attacks;promising unsupervised approach","","2","","44","IEEE","18 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Communication in these applications is often regular, but with very long periods, ranging from minutes to hours. This infrequent communication and the complexity of today's systems makes these applications difficult for users to detect and diagnose. In this paper we present a new approach to identify low-rate periodic network traffic and changes in such regular communication. We employ signal-processing techniques, using discrete wavelets implemented as a fully decomposed, iterated filter bank. This approach not only detects low-rate periodicities, but also identifies approximate times when traffic changed.

Data-driven learning of discrimination functions is especially hard when deployment sites are remote or hazardous, necessitating reliance on surrogate environments for data collection. The challenge is exacerbated if sensors are resource constrained. We present an intruder discrimination system that addresses these challenges in the context of a battery powered radar mote. The system robustly rejects clutter moving in-situ to trigger discrimination of humans versus other targets only when said targets displace across the scene. Its learning uses a new, generic extension to feature selection methods that leverages cross-environmental robustness instead of a random or bounded model of feature noise. We experimentally validate that our scheme improves the cross-environmental performance medians and dispersions of extant methods by up to 70% and 100% respectively. It achieves optimal performance with very few features given a modest number of diverse training environments, allowing for efficient mote-scale implementation. A mote mesh network has been deployed to detect poachers while rejecting cattle and other non-targets at a rhino reserve in South Africa.","2155-6814","978-1-5386-2324-4","10.1109/MASS.2017.54","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8108775","","Robustness;Training;Radar;Clutter;Wireless sensor networks;Machine learning;Feature extraction","object recognition;radar target recognition;sensor placement;wireless sensor networks","structured electronic noise;feature selection methods;South Africa;battery powered radar mote;data-driven learning;electronic noise;wireless sensor networks;target discrimination;cross-environmentally robust intruder discrimination","","","","25","","16 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Examples include transportation systems where a group of moving cars communicate in order to avoid collisions, teams of robotic agents that work together in support of disaster recovery, and sensor networks deployed for health-care monitoring, monitoring the operation of a factory plant or to coordinate and actuate mechanisms for energy conservation in a building. These networks may face a variety of threats that puncture their connectivity and, should their performance degrade, the result could be catastrophic. Consider, for example, a vehicular ad hoc network where communication assists collision avoidance. In such a case, degradation could lead to vehicle accidents. Therefore, in order to overcome network performance degradations and the puncture of a network (such as blackhole or jamming) which is under attack, we propose an algorithm called the Fiedler Value Power Adjustment Topology Adaption (FVPATA). FVPATA aims to dynamically adapt an ad hoc network’s topology, even if the attacker varies its location and in the case of an interference-style attack by increasing the interference power. The algorithm utilizes the formulation from the graph theory which works with the Fiedler value to guide each node in wireless ad hoc network utilizing power adjustments to enhance the network’s overall robustness. The advantage of the proposed mechanism is that it is a light-weight approach which is totally distributed, based on topology updates inherent in the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol and, hence, it is unnecessary to introduce additional messages. Additionally, an algorithm was developed to resolve problems involving asymmetric links that arise in ad hoc networks by eliminating unnecessary energy consumption of Fiedler nodes. Simulation results using NS3 show that the proposed mechanism successfully decreases the average amount of hops used by 50% and the delay of flows when nodes are migrating at a modest rate below 60 m/min.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2015.7173452","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7173452","algebraic connectivity;Fiedler value;topology adaptation;distributed power control;ad hoc networks","Network topology;Ad hoc networks;Topology;Robustness;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Protocols;Routing","computer network security;peer-to-peer computing;topology;vehicular ad hoc networks","NS3;Fiedler nodes;OLSR protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;Fiedler value;graph theory;ad hoc network topology;FVPATA;Fiedler value power adjustment topology adaption;vehicle accident;collision avoidance;vehicular ad hoc network;health-care monitoring;robotic agent;peer-to-peer communication;Puncture-Style Attacks;robust ad hoc cyberphysical network","","","","","","3 Aug 2015","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

However, researchers focused on how to improve models' detection performance and work out new blockchain-based protection technologies during the past decades. Due to lack of evolving data, these models and technologies may have poor stability in the face of confrontational samples. To cope with the problem, this paper proposes a novel LSTM-CGAN method to generate high-quality LDDoS adversarial samples for blockchain-based wireless network detection models. In this method, we give a brief feature analysis about LDDoS attack in blockchain-based wireless network and work out its corresponding time series model firstly. And then, we take use of Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) to learn relationships among sequenced network packages in the same flow. At last, we establish a Condition Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) model to use above relationships as specific conditions for generating mimicking behaviors of LDDoS attacks in blockchain-based wireless network. The experimental results show that these generated adversarial samples based on both public and private datasets can cheat the machine learning detection models, and have the similar attack characteristics with the real samples.

Reputation represents the network-wide belief or perception of the trustworthiness of an entity. Each entity computes and assigns a trust or reputation value, which increases and decreases with the appropriateness of actions and reactions, to another entity in order to ensure a healthy collaborative relationship. Trust and reputation management (TRM) has been investigated to improve the security of traditional networks, particularly the access networks. In 5G, the access networks are multi-hop networks formed by entities which may not be trustable, and so such networks are prone to attacks, such as Sybil and crude attacks. TRM addresses such attacks to enhance the overall network performance, including reliability, scalability, and stability. Nevertheless, the investigation of TRM in 5G, which is the next-generation wireless networks, is still at its infancy. TRM must cater for the characteristics of 5G. Firstly, ultra-densification due to the exponential growth of mobile users and data traffic. Secondly, high heterogeneity due to the different characteristics of mobile users, such as different transmission characteristics (e.g., different transmission power) and different user equipment (e.g., laptops and smartphones). Thirdly, high variability due to the dynamicity of the entities' behaviors and operating environment. TRM must also cater for the core features of 5G (e.g., millimeter wave transmission, and device-to-device communication) and the core technologies of 5G (e.g., massive MIMO and beamforming, and network virtualization). In this paper, a review of TRM schemes in 5G and traditional networks, which can be leveraged to 5G, is presented. We also provide an insight on some of the important open issues and vulnerabilities in 5G networks that can be resolved using a TRM framework.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2984318","Malaysian Ministry of Education under Fundamental Research Grant Scheme through the part of the Project “A Novel Clustering Algorithm based on Reinforcement Learning for the Optimization of Global and Local Network Performances in Mobile Networks”(grant numbers:FRGS/1/2019/ICT03/SYUC/01/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9050780","Next-generation networks;5G;cooperation;trust and reputation management;artificial intelligence","5G mobile communication;Transmission line measurements;Collaboration;Security;Performance evaluation;Next generation networking;Roads","5G mobile communication;MIMO communication;next generation networks;radio access networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","5G access networks;mobile device;network-wide belief;healthy collaborative relationship;multihop networks;TRM addresses;next-generation wireless networks;mobile users;transmission characteristics;user equipment;device-to-device communication;network virtualization;TRM schemes;trust-reputation managemen;millimeter wave transmission;massive MIMO","","2","","59","CCBY","30 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For a long time, the networking and distributed computing system is the key infrastructure to provide efficient computational resources for machine learning. Networking itself can also benefit from this promising technology. This article focuses on the application of MLN, which can not only help solve the intractable old network questions but also stimulate new network applications. In this article, we summarize the basic workflow to explain how to apply machine learning technology in the networking domain. Then we provide a selective survey of the latest representative advances with explanations of their design principles and benefits. These advances are divided into several network design objectives and the detailed information of how they perform in each step of MLN workflow is presented. Finally, we shed light on the new opportunities in networking design and community building of this new inter-discipline. Our goal is to provide a broad research guideline on networking with machine learning to help motivate researchers to develop innovative algorithms, standards and frameworks.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.2017.1700200","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8121867","","Hidden Markov models;Feature extraction;Data models;Training;Machine learning algorithms;Decision making;Predictive models","computer network management;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication computing","distributed computing system;MLN workflow;networking design;community building;machine learning for networking","","87","","15","","28 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Organizations safeguarding sensitive information have difficulty in identifying new malware threats among millions of benign executables using only signature-based antivirus systems. This paper extends a performance-based malware target recognition architecture that currently uses only static heuristic features. Experimental results show that this architectural component achieves an overall test accuracy of 98.5% against a malware set collected from operational environments, while three commercial antivirus products combine for a detection accuracy of only 60% with their most sensitive settings. Implementations of this architecture will enable organizations to self-discover new malware threats, providing enhanced situation awareness for cyberspace operators in hostile threat environments.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2012.2221913","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6365737","Advanced persistent threat;antivirus;intrusion detection;malware detection;situation awareness","Malware;Organizations;Training;Decision trees;Accuracy;Sensitivity;Feature extraction","digital signatures;invasive software","malware target recognition;unknown threats;organizations;signature-based commercial antivirus products;frontline defense;custom malicious tools;malware threats;architectural component;cyberspace operators;hostile threat environments","","10","","32","","30 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
