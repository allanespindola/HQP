Although the state-of-the-art detection algorithms have shown quite promising detection performance, they suffer from computationally intensive operations and large memory footprint, making themselves infeasible to applications at the resourceconstrained edge devices. We propose a lightweight yet effective NIDS scheme that incorporates a stacked autoencoder with a network pruning technique. By removing a set of ineffective neurons across layers in the autoencoder network with a certain probability based on their importance, a considerably large portion of relatively nominal training parameters are reduced. Then, the pruned and pre-trained encoder network is used as-is and is connected with a separate classifier network for attack type inference, avoiding a full retraining from scratch. Experimental results indicate that our stacked autoencoder-based classification network with probabilistic feature extraction has outperformed the state-of-the-art NIDSs in terms of attack detection rate. Further, we have shown that our lightweight NIDS scheme has significantly reduced the computational complexity throughout the architecture, making it feasible to the edge, while maintaining a similar attack type detection quality compared with its original fully-connected neural network.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3078292","Samsung Research Funding and Incubation Center of Samsung Electronics(grant numbers:SRFC-IT1803-00); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9425583","Network Intrusion Detection System;On-Device AI;Anomaly Classification;Feature Extraction.","Feature extraction;Neurons;Image edge detection;Network intrusion detection;Internet of Things;Computational modeling;Probabilistic logic","","","","2","","","IEEE","7 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This approach models illegitimate users as ones who randomly access records. The goal is to use statistics, machine learning, knowledge of workflows and other techniques to support an anomaly detection framework that finds such users. In this paper we introduce and study a random topic access model or RTA aimed at users whose access may be illegitimate but is not fully random because it is focused on common semantic themes. We argue that this model is appropriate for a meaningful range of attacks and develop a system based on topic summarization that is able to formalize the model and provide anomalous user detection effectively for it. To this end, we use healthcare as an example and propose a framework for evaluating the ability to recognize various types of random users called random topic access detection or RTAD. Specifically, we utilize a combination of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), for feature extraction, a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm for outlier detection and evaluate the ability to identify different adversarial types. We validate the technique in the context of hospital audit logs where we show varying degrees of success based on user roles and the anticipated characteristics of attackers. In particular, it was found that RTAD exhibits strong performance for roles are described by a few topics, but weaker performance when users are more topic-agnostic.","","978-1-4673-6213-9","10.1109/ISI.2013.6578795","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6578795","Data Mining;Anomaly Detection;Healthcare Security;Electronic Health Records;Access Logs;Insider threats","Hospitals;Medical diagnostic imaging;Context;Information systems;Sociology;Statistics","data mining;feature extraction;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;random processes;security of data","anomalous topic access detection;anomalous topic access modeling;strategy development;insider threat detection;information systems;random object access model;ROA model;random record access;machine learning;statistics;workflow knowledge;anomaly detection framework;random topic access model;RTA;topic summarization;model formalization;anomalous user detection;healthcare;random users;random topic access detection;RTAD;latent Dirichlet allocation;LDA;feature extraction;k-nearest neighbor algorithm;k-NN algorithm;outlier detection;hospital audit logs;user roles;attacker characteristics","","9","","13","","15 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Additionally, as the Fog-CPS systems could be deployed in open and unprotected environments, the CPS devices and fog nodes are vulnerable to numerous attacks namely, collusion, self-promotion, badmouthing, ballot-stuffing, and opportunistic service. The compromised entities can impact the accuracy of trust computation model by increasing/decreasing the trust of other nodes. These challenges are addressed by designing a generic trust credibility model which can countermeasures the compromise of both CPS devices and fog nodes. The credibility of each newly computed trust value is evaluated and subsequently adjusted by correlating it with a standard deviation threshold. The standard deviation is quantified by computing the trust in two configurations of hostile environments and subsequently comparing it with the trust value in a legitimate/normal environment.

In this paper, we provide a mechanism that not only detects the presence of a DDoS attacks but also identifies the route of attack and commences a process of mitigation at the initial stage of identification. The proposed research involves an optimized SVM classification algorithm integrated with SNORT IPS to provide prevention mechanisms for the entire network when subject to DDoS attack.

The first step is to extract the number of data collection points of each machine tool and the length of TCP payload of each packet. And the second step is to use data response processing times of machine tools to construct unique fingerprint for each machine.

The vulnerability of attacks is on a hike that manual or simple rule-based detection of cyber-attacks is not robust. In order to tackle cyber attacks in a reliable manner, an automated Intrusion Detection system equipped with a swarm intelligence (SI) based machine learning model (ML) is essential to deploy at entry points of the network. Nowadays, the application of SI with ML is used in various research areas. For an efficient IDS, choosing relevant features from the noisy data is an open question. In this regard, this paper proposes a method that utilizes the Whale Pearson hybrid feature selection wrapper for reducing the irrelevancy in the IDS model. Whale Pearson hybrid wrapper is an improved version of the binary Whale optimization Algorithm (WOA). The WOA is a type of SI algorithm which is inspired by the behavior of humpback whales. The proposed method has chosen 8 out of 42 features from the Hackereath Network attack prediction data-set, which are sufficient for building an efficient Intrusion detection model. The model trained with the eight features produces an accuracy of 80%, which is 8% greater than the accuracy produced by the original data-set with the KNN algorithm on ten-fold cross-validation.","","978-1-7281-6929-3","10.1109/CEC48606.2020.9185887","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185887","Intrusion Detection;Cloud Computing;Machine Learning;Feature Selection;Whale Pearson wrapper","Whales;Cloud computing;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Correlation;Particle swarm optimization;Machine learning","cloud computing;computer network security;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;swarm intelligence","cloud infrastructure;network intrusion;cloud computing service providers;rule-based detection;cyber-attacks;automated intrusion detection system;swarm intelligence based machine learning model;Whale Pearson hybrid feature selection wrapper;IDS model;Whale Pearson hybrid wrapper;binary whale optimization algorithm;Hackereath Network attack prediction data-set;model training","","1","","33","","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Santra",Infineon Technologies AG; Infineon Technologies AG,"2019 18th IEEE International Conference On Machine Learning And Applications (ICMLA)","17 Feb 2020","2019","","","175","182","We present a radar-based detection processing framework for accurate detection and counting of human targets in an indoor environment. This can be used to control lighting, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) in smart homes and other presence related loads in commercial, office, and public spaces. Such smart home applications can facilitate monitoring, controlling, and saving energy. Conventionally, the radar range-Doppler processing pipeline includes moving target indicators (MTI) to remove static targets, maximal ratio combining (MRC) to integrate data across antennas, constant false alarm rate (CFAR) based detectors and then clustering algorithms to generate the target range-Doppler detections. However, the conventional pipeline suffers from ghost targets and multi-path reflections from static objects such as walls, furniture, etc. Further, conventional parametric clustering algorithms lead to single target splits and adjacent target merges in the target range-Doppler detections. To overcome such issues, we propose a deep residual U-net architecture that generates human target detections directly from static target removed range-Doppler images (RDI). To train this network, we record RDIs from a variety of indoor scenes with different configurations and multiple humans targets. We devise a custom loss function and apply augmentation strategies to generalize this model during real-time inference of the model. We demonstrate that the proposed network can efficiently learn to detect and correctly count human targets under different indoor environments while the conventional signal processing pipeline fails.","","978-1-7281-4550-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2019.00035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8999233","60 GHz mm-wave radar;deep residual UNet;Receiver Operating Characteristics;Detection Strategy;DBSCAN;People Counting","Chirp;Radar antennas;Doppler radar;Object detection;Pipelines;Clustering algorithms","Doppler radar;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;radar detection;radar imaging;radar tracking;target tracking;ultra wideband radar","radar-based human target detection;deep residual U-net;radar-based detection processing framework;heating-ventilation and air conditioning;smart homes;radar range-Doppler processing pipeline;constant false alarm rate based detectors;target range-Doppler detections;ghost targets;parametric clustering algorithms;single target splits;adjacent target merges;human target detections;static target removed range-Doppler images;multiple humans targets;signal processing pipeline;indoor environment;maximal ratio combining;constant false alarm rate","","10","","24","","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent studies have shown that the potential threats targeting AMI are significant. Despite the need of developing intrusion detection systems (IDS) tailored for the smart grid [4], very limited progress has been made in this area so far. Unlike traditional networks, smart grid has its unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, which restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. However, smart grid exhibits behavior that can be accurately modeled based on its configuration, which can be exploited to design efficient intrusion detectors. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the specifications invariant generated from the configurations of the AMI devices. We model the AMI behavior using the fourth order Markov chain and the stochastic model is then probabilistically verified using specifications written in Linear Temporal Logic. Our model is capable of detecting malicious behavior in the AMI network due to intrusions or device malfunctioning. We validate our approach on a real-world dataset of thousands of meters collected at the AMI of a leading utility provider.","","978-1-4799-1526-2","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6688002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6688002","","Markov processes;Smart grids;Correlation;Entropy;Monitoring;Accuracy","energy management systems;Markov processes;power engineering computing;safety systems;smart meters;smart power grids;temporal logic","advanced metering infrastructure;AMI;intrusion detection systems;IDS;probabilistic model checking;smart grids;bidirectional communication;smart meters;user premises;utility provider;energy management;event log collection;smart collectors;fourth order Markov chain;stochastic model;linear temporal logic;malicious behavior detection;device malfunctioning;real-world dataset","","3","","14","","19 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given the rigorous validation process and the requirements for the highest level of safety standards and risk management, AI needs to prove itself being safe to operate. This paper addresses the safety issues of AI deployment in an aviation network compatible with the Future Communication Infrastructure that utilizes heterogeneous wireless access technologies for communications between the aircraft and the ground networks. It further considers the exploitation of software defined networking (SDN) technologies in the ground network while the adoption of SDN in the airborne network can be optional. Due to the nature of centralized management in SDN-based network, the SDN controller can become a single point of failure or a target for cyber attacks. To countermeasure such attacks, an intrusion detection system utilises AI techniques, more specifically deep neural network (DNN), is considered. However, an adversary can target the AI-based intrusion detection system. This paper examines the impact of AI security attacks on the performance of the DNN algorithm. Poisoning attacks targeting the DSL-KDD datasets which were used to train the DNN algorithm were launched at the intrusion detection system.

In detail, we report on a novel lightweight and scalable approach to increase the security of DCs/SCs, which involves AI-powered edge computing on high-resolution power consumption. The method-called pAElla-targets real-time malware detection (MD), it runs on an out-of-band IoT-based monitoring system for DCs/SCs, and involves power spectral density of power measurements, along with autoencoders. Results are promising, with an F1-score close to 1, and a false alarm and malware miss rate close to 0%. We compare our method with State-of-the-Art (SoA) MD techniques and show that, in the context of DCs/SCs, pAElla can cover a wider range of malware, significantly outperforming SoA approaches in terms of accuracy. Moreover, we propose a methodology for online training suitable for DCs/SCs in production, and release open data set and code.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.2986702","EU H2020 Project IoTwins(grant numbers:857191); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9060937","Artificial intelligence (AI);data center (DC);edge computing;Internet-of-Things (IoT) monitoring;malware detection (MD);supercomputer","Malware;Monitoring;Real-time systems;Edge computing;Power measurement;Training;Internet of Things","computer centres;computer network security;data analysis;data mining;Internet of Things;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification","open data;State-of-the-Art MD techniques;malware miss rate;power measurements;power spectral density;out-of-band IoT-based;method-called pAElla-targets real-time malware detection;high-resolution power consumption;AI-powered edge computing;scalable approach;anomaly detection;high-resolution monitoring systems;supercomputers;network edge;smart approaches;particular approaches;emerging edge computing paradigm;data analysis;big data;Internet-of-Things devices;data centers;edge AI-based real-time malware detection","","3","","74","IEEE","8 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a new method known as the brute-force attack method to better evaluate the robustness of the machine learning classifiers in cybersecurity against adversarial examples. The proposed method, which works in a black-box way and covers some shortages of the existing adversarial attack methods based on generative adversarial networks, is simple to implement and only needs the output of the target classifiers to generate adversarial examples. To have a comprehensive evaluation of the attack performance of the proposed method, we use our method to generate adversarial examples against the common machine learning based security systems in cybersecurity including host intrusion detection systems, Android malware detection systems, and network intrusion detection systems. We compare the attack performance of the proposed method against these security systems with that of state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods based on generative adversarial networks.

To achieve these, industrial control system (ICS) networks and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are deployed in critical infrastructure assets. Many events in ICS networks present strong periodical patterns because of process repetition or cyclic communication. From the security viewpoint, inferring the periodicity primarily in the device-level communications where the actuator/sensor, field, and the cell-level transmissions are performed is important for detecting anomalies. The synchronization period and traffic pattern need to be known for anomaly detection. This article presents a novel periodicity detection approach specifically for Ethernet for control automation technology (EtherCAT) networks. It uses protocol-specific operations and fields for detecting device-level periodicity. Using the period, an anomaly detection method that uncovers traffic pattern statistics is also proposed. The periodicity can be detected with different precision, significance levels, and lag sizes. Four programmable logic controller (PLC) programs were developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the periodicity detection approach, and the periodicity was automatically obtained with high accuracy. As any malicious activity on the system causes variances in the periodic pattern, the approach was also tested on synthetic traffic traces that contain denial of service (DoS) and code-injection attacks. The traffic patterns were uncovered by an anomaly detection module, which was developed on a Snort intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) and used the captured period. The tests demonstrated that intrusions that exploit communication patterns are fully flagged.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2020.3037050","BAPK, Scientific Research Projects Unit of the Sakarya University(grant numbers:2015-50-02-025); TUBITAK; Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey(grant numbers:118E263); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9253613","EtherCAT;critical infrastructure systems;industrial control systems;periodicity detection;SCADA security;zero-day attacks","Integrated circuits;Protocols;Anomaly detection;Monitoring;TCPIP;Traffic control;Critical infrastructure","computer network security;control engineering computing;industrial control;local area networks;programmable controllers;protocols;SCADA systems;synchronisation;telecommunication traffic","protocol-specific operations;anomaly detection method;traffic pattern statistics;programmable logic controller programs;anomaly detection module;EtherCAT-based industrial control network;critical infrastructure networks;supervisory control and data acquisition systems;critical infrastructure assets;device-level communications;cell-level transmissions;ICS network;SCADA systems;Snort intrusion detection/prevention system;Ethernet for control automation technology networks;denial of service attacks;DoS attacks;code-injection attacks","","1","","45","IEEE","10 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, detecting attacks in large-scale networks is very challenging because they require high detection rates under real-time resource constraints. In this paper, we focus on detecting infected Internet of Things (IoT) hosts from domain name system (DNS) traffic data. IoT hosts, such as streaming cameras, printers, air conditioners, are hard to protect, unlike PCs and servers. Enterprises are often unaware of the devices which are connected to the network, their types, makes, and vulnerabilities. Since IoT hosts make use of the DNS protocol, analyzing DNS data can give a broad view of malicious activities, because they abuse the DNS protocol and leave fingerprints as part of their attack vector. In this collaborative research between Ben-Gurion University, and IBM, we establish a novel algorithm to detect infected IoT hosts in large-scale DNS traffic, named Anomaly and Reputation Based Algorithm (ARBA). Its novelty resides in developing a framework that combines host classification and domain reputation in a real-time production environment. ARBA is highly computational efficient and meets real-time requirements in terms of run time and computational complexity. By contrast to existing algorithms, it does not require a massive traffic volume for training, which is of significant interest in detecting infected hosts in real-time. The research was conducted on real live streaming data from IBM internal network traffic, and confirm the algorithm's strong performance in a real-time production environment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3014619","IBM Cyber Security Center of Excellence, Gav-Yam Negev; Israeli National Cyber Bureau via the Cyber Security Research Center, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9160931","Cyber security;anomaly detection;domain name system (DNS);detection algorithms;real-time algorithms","Real-time systems;Machine learning algorithms;Botnet;Computer crime;Internet of Things;Anomaly detection","computer network security;Internet;Internet of Things;invasive software;telecommunication traffic","ARBA;infected IoT devices;cyber attacks;large-scale networks;high detection rates;real-time resource constraints;infected Internet;domain name system traffic data;IoT hosts;DNS protocol;DNS data;attack vector;large-scale DNS traffic;host classification;domain reputation;real-time production environment;real-time requirements;infected hosts;live streaming data;IBM internal network traffic","","2","","58","CCBY","6 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, the accurate and timely detection of such threats is of great importance. Detecting machines infected with malware by identifying their malicious activities at the network level is an appealing approach, due to the ease of deployment. Nowadays, the most common communication channels used by attackers to control the infected machines are based on the HTTP protocol. To evade detection, HTTP-based malware adapt their behavior to the communication patterns of the benign HTTP clients, such as web browsers. This poses significant challenges to existing detection approaches like signature-based and behavioral-based detection systems. In this paper, we propose BOTHOUND: a novel approach to precisely detect HTTP-based malware at the network level. The key idea is that implementations of the HTTP protocol by different entities have small but perceivable differences. Building on this observation,BOTHOUND automatically generates models for malicious and benign requests and classifies at real time the HTTP traffic of a monitored network. Our evaluation results demonstrate that BOTHOUND outperforms prior work on identifying HTTP-based botnets, being able to detect a large variety of real-world HTTP-based malware, including advanced persistent threats used in targeted attacks, with a very low percentage of classification errors.","","978-1-4799-3503-1","10.1109/PST.2014.6890946","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890946","","Malware;Protocols;Accuracy;Browsers;Monitoring;Training;Software","Internet;invasive software","HTTP-based malware detection;malicious software;botnets;security threats;Internet;HTTP protocol;hypertext transfer protocol;Web browsers;signature-based detection system;behavioral-based detection system;BOTHOUND approach;HTTP traffic;classification errors","","23","","32","","8 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a novel method to detect malicious queries using a twin Hidden Markov Model (HMM) ensemble and validate it with large set of benign and malicious queries collected from five sample web applications written in PHP and MySQL. Following the Multiple Classifier System (MCS) paradigm, we combine the output of individual HMMs to arrive at the final decision, which provides better accuracy and lower false alarms. The system is intended to work at the database firewall layer, therefore it can protect multiple web applications hosted on a shared server. The initial experimental results are very encouraging and indicate that the approach can effectively identify wide varieties of SQLIA with negligible impact on performance.

At the same time, network operators must support these devices with differentiated services, which rely on the ability to automatically recognize and classify the nature of the communication flows. In this paper, we present a supervised learning approach to discriminate between IoT and non-IoT traffic, and to determine the class of the device originating the packet flows. We make use of a reduced set of features based on the spectral analysis of the packet lengths of a flow, and evaluate an ensemble learning algorithm that uses a Random Forest classifier. We first discuss the datasets and the procedure that we use to extract the features, with examples from different devices. The evaluation is performed using both 10-fold cross validation and a split between training, validation and test-set. The latter is used for hyperparameter tuning. The results show that for reasonably large datasets the classifier achieves very high accuracy, as well as Precision and Recall rates. We further improve the performance on individual devices by selectively replicating the flows in the dataset, to achieve a better balance. We then evaluate a real-time implementation, and propose a runtime procedure to evaluate the model confidence level and trigger a retraining phase to adapt to a changing environment. A detailed analysis of the performance shows that the algorithm can support networks up to 100 Gbps on standard computing platforms.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3012203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9149907","Ensemble learning;FFT;IoT;random forest;spectral analysis;traffic classification","Spectral analysis;Machine-to-machine communications;Forestry;Performance evaluation;Decision trees;Internet of Things;Protocols","feature extraction;Internet of Things;random forests;spectral analysis;supervised learning;telecommunication traffic","packet length spectral analysis;IoT flow classification;ubiquitous devices;autonomous devices;differentiated services;communication flows;supervised learning approach;nonIoT traffic;packet flows;ensemble learning algorithm;random forest classifier;10-fold cross validation;Internet of Things","","","","50","CCBY","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result, the availability of the server could suffer from a bad IP address reputation and thus, blocked access to all accounts in the server, not only the compromised account. The emergence of web application firewalls (WAF) manages to close the gap by thoroughly analysing HTTP requests in search of known vulnerabilities. However, as any misuse type mechanism, it falls short at discovering zero-day attacks or already compromised environment. In this paper, an anomaly detection model is proposed as a very helpful tool to start building an efficient intrusion detection system adapted to a specific web application or to assist a forensic analysis.

The dynamic complexity of their cyber-physical systems (CPSs) and their strong interdependences with power systems are bringing about a significant increase in security problems that may be exploited by attackers. These security holes may, for example, trigger the disintegration of the structural controllability properties due to the problem of nonlocality, affecting, sooner or later, the provision of the essential services to end-users. One way to address these situations could be through automatic checkpoints in charge of inspecting the healthy status of the control network and its critical nature. This inspection can be subject to special mechanisms composed of trustworthy cyber-physical elements capable of detecting structural changes in the control and activating restoration procedures with support for warning. This is precisely the aim of this paper, which presents a CPSs-based checkpoint model with the capacity to manage heterogeneous replications that help ensure data redundancy, thereby guaranteeing the validity of the checkpoints. As a support to this study, a theoretical and practical analysis is addressed to show the functionality of the approach in real contexts.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2017.2740719","PERSIST(grant numbers:TIN2013-41739-R); SADCIP(grant numbers:RTC-2016-4847-8); Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad; NECS(grant numbers:H2020-MSCA-ITN-2015); European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(grant numbers:675320); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8057984","Critical control systems;cyber-physical systems (CPSs);smart grids;structural controllability","Peer-to-peer computing;Controllability;Monitoring;Smart grids;Network topology;Topology;Cyber-physical systems","checkpointing;cyber-physical systems;security of data;trusted computing","monitoring systems;cutting-edge research areas;dynamic complexity;strong interdependences;power systems;security problems;security holes;structural controllability properties;end-users;automatic checkpoints;control network;critical nature;trustworthy cyber-physical elements;structural changes;CPSs-based checkpoint model;cyber-physical systems-based checkpoint model;critical user-centric applications;smart grids;restoration procedures;data redundancy","","","","39","IEEE","4 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, in this article, we focus on the transmission path selection strategy design to guarantee the secure state estimation on the edge side against dynamic denial-of-service attacks. First, we present a novel learning-based secure routing algorithm (LSRA) to learn the attack rule and predict the attacker's next conduct with the use of both historical and online data. With lower computational complexity, the proposed learning algorithm could track the attack rule in real time whenever new data comes. Meanwhile, we derive the analytical relationship between the probability upper bound of learning error and the learning time. Based on the predicted attacker's behavior obtained by the learning algorithm, we flexibly select the secure routing path to avoid being attacked and, thus, improve successful transmission probability. Furthermore, this secure routing path selection method improves the performance of the state estimation system. The theoretical analysis of estimator stability is given.

Most existing works are established on the assumption that the maximum tolerable number of attacks, which depends on the network connectivity, is known by all normal agents. All normal agents will use the maximum number of attacks to decide whether the received information will be used for iterations. In this article, we relax this assumption and propose a novel resilient distributed optimization algorithm. The proposed algorithm exploits the trusted agents which cannot be compromised by adversarial attacks and form a connected dominating set in the original graph to constrain effects of adversarial attacks. It is shown that local variables of all normal and trusted agents converge to the same value under the proposed algorithm. Further, the final solution belongs to the convex set of minimizers of the weighted average of local cost functions of all trusted agents. The upper bound of the distance between the final solution and the optimal one has also been provided.

A comprehensive risk assessment method should consider the risk propagation among risky hosts and flows. In this paper, this is achieved by introducing two novel concepts. First, an interdependency relationship among the risk scores of a network flow and its source and destination hosts. On the one hand, the risk score of a host depends on risky flows initiated by or terminated at the host. On the other hand, the risk score of a flow depends on the risk scores of its source and destination hosts. Second, which we call flow provenance, represents risk propagation among network flows which considers the likelihood that a particular flow is caused by the other flows. Based on these two concepts, we develop an iterative algorithm for computing the risk score of hosts and network flows. We give a rigorous proof that our algorithm rapidly converges to unique risk estimates, and provide its extensive empirical evaluation using two real-world data sets. Our evaluation shows that our method is effective in detecting high risk hosts and flows and is sufficiently efficient to be deployed in the high throughput networks.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2455414","ICT Centre, CSIRO, Australia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7154480","network risk assessment;flow provenance;risk propagation;Network risk assessment;flow provenance;risk propagation","Risk management;Correlation;Web servers;Monitoring;Iterative methods;Computational modeling","computer network security;invasive software;risk management","interdependent security risk analysis;high risk host detection;high risk flow detection;high throughput network security monitoring;comprehensive risk assessment method;risk propagation;interdependency relationship;risk scores;flow provenance;real-world data sets;distributed denial-of-service attacks;botnet initiated attacks","","17","","21","IEEE","10 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many papers in the literature rely on explicit features derived from network, file system, or registry interaction. While effective, use of these fine-granularity data points makes these techniquse computationally expensive. Moreover, the signatures and heuristics this analysis produces are often circumvented by subsequent malware authors. To this end we propose CHATTER, a system that is concerned only with the order in which high-level system events take place. Individual events are mapped onto an alphabet and execution traces are captured via terse concatenations of those letters. Then, leveraging an analyst labeled corpus of malware, n-gram document classification techniques are applied to produce a classifier predicting malware family. This paper describes that technique and its proof-of-concept evaluation. In its prototype form only network events are considered and three malware families are highlighted. We show the technique achieves roughly 80% accuracy in isolation and makes non-trivial performance improvements when integrated with a baseline classifier of non-ordered features (with an accuracy of roughly 95%).","","978-1-4799-5890-0","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997496","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997496","","Malware;Accuracy;Support vector machines;Machine learning algorithms;Decision trees;Feature extraction","document handling;invasive software;pattern classification","Chatter;malware families classification;system event ordering;runtime execution artifacts;malware identification;security domain;file system;registry interaction;fine granularity data points;heuristics;malware authors;high level system events;n-gram document classification;classifier predicting malware family;proof-of-concept evaluation;network events","","10","1","53","","29 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition to the different communication protocols, securing such communications and establishing a certain trustiness among vehicles are among the main challenges to address, since the presence of dishonest peers can lead to unwanted situations. To this end, existing security solutions are typically divided into two main categories, cryptography and trust, where trust appeared as a complement to cryptography on some specific adversary models and environments where the latter was not enough to mitigate all possible attacks. In this paper, we provide an adversary-oriented survey of the existing trust models for VANETs. We also show when trust is preferable to cryptography, and the opposite.

In our model, a defender and an attacker play out a game with resources consisting of both real and decoy systems, a set of pre-determined actions for each player, and a method for defining and evaluating individual player strategies and payoffs. Our research provides a general framework for representing deception games using multiple game trees and an explicit representation of each individual player's knowledge of game structure and payoffs.

In this article, to mitigate the inconsistency between dimensionality reduction and feature retention in imbalanced IBD, we propose a variational long short-term memory (VLSTM) learning model for intelligent anomaly detection based on reconstructed feature representation. An encoder-decoder neural network associated with a variational reparameterization scheme is designed to learn the low-dimensional feature representation from high-dimensional raw data. Three loss functions are defined and quantified to constrain the reconstructed hidden variable into a more explicit and meaningful form. A lightweight estimation network is then fed with the refined feature representation to identify anomalies in IBD. Experiments using a public IBD dataset named UNSW-NB15 demonstrate that the proposed VLSTM model can efficiently cope with imbalance and high-dimensional issues, and significantly improve the accuracy and reduce the false rate in anomaly detection for IBD according to F1, area under curve (AUC), and false alarm rate (FAR).","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2020.3022432","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFE0117500); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2019JJ40150); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61702183); Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Department(grant numbers:2019GK2131); Key Project of Hunan Provincial Education Department(grant numbers:17A113); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9195000","Anomaly detection;feature representation;industrial big data (IBD);long short-term memory (LSTM);variational Bayes","Anomaly detection;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Dimensionality reduction;Neural networks;Estimation","Big Data;learning (artificial intelligence);production engineering computing;recurrent neural nets;security of data","encoder-decoder neural network;variational reparameterization scheme;low-dimensional feature representation;high-dimensional raw data;public IBD dataset;variational LSTM enhanced anomaly detection;industrial big data;digital industry field;intelligent industry field;data stream;high-dimensional anomaly detection;intelligent industrial application;dimensionality reduction;feature retention;imbalanced IBD;intelligent anomaly detection;reconstructed feature representation;variational long short-term memory learning model","","19","","27","CCBY","11 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, Android does not allow write access to any of the sensors. Sensing-based security and non-security applications, therefore, crucially rely upon the sanity of the Android sensor security model. In this paper, we show that such a model can be effectively circumvented. Specifically, we build SMASheD, a legitimate framework under the current Android ecosystem that can be used to stealthily sniff as well as manipulate many of the Android's restricted sensors (even touch input). SMASheD exploits the Android debug bridge functionality and enables a malicious app with only the INTERNET permission to read, and write to, multiple different sensor data files at will. SMASheD is the first framework, to the best of our knowledge, that can sniff and manipulate protected sensors on unrooted Android devices, without user awareness, without constant device-PC connection and without the need to infect the PC. The primary contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we design and develop the SMASheD framework, and evaluate its effectiveness on multiple Android devices, including phones, watches, and glasses. Second, as an offensive implication of the SMASheD framework, we introduce a wide array of potentially devastating attacks. Our attacks against the touch sensor range from accurately logging the touchscreen input (TouchLogger) to injecting touch events for accessing restricted sensors and resources, installing and granting special permissions to other malicious apps, accessing user accounts, and authenticating on behalf of the user-essentially almost doing whatever the device user can do (secretively).

In reality, intrusion detection systems pay more attention to the detection accuracy of a small number of classes, that is, attack samples. In order to improve the detection accuracy of intrusion detection system, a network intrusion detection method based on deep convolution generative adversarial networks (DCGAN) was proposed. Firstly, the sample data of network intrusion is preprocessed, and the character data set is replaced by image data. Then, DCGAN is used to train and test the sample data. Both the generator and the discriminator are constructed by CNN. The generator is used to construct attack samples, balance the number of training samples, and solve the over fitting problem caused by insufficient training samples. Finally, the trained discriminator is used to test the classification accuracy of samples. Experimental results show that, compared with the traditional algorithm, the proposed algorithm can not only balance the detection accuracy of various types of samples, but also has higher detection accuracy for attack samples.","2689-6621","978-1-7281-8028-1","10.1109/IAEAC50856.2021.9390891","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9390891","Intrusion detection;DCGAN;CNN;Data preprocessing","Training;Fitting;Network intrusion detection;Generative adversarial networks;Generators;Classification algorithms;Information technology","computer network security;convolutional neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","network intrusion detection technology;DCGAN;data imbalance;intrusion detection system;attack samples;network intrusion detection method;deep convolution generative adversarial networks;sample data;character data;image data;detection accuracy;CNN;classification accuracy","","","","10","","5 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, an amalgamation of work has realized such defenses using Deep Learning (DL) based algorithms. Although DL-based algorithms are generally prone to adversarial learning attacks, the extent to which those attacks are applicable to DDoS defenses in SDN is unexamined. In this work, we explore the robustness of DL-based DDoS defenses in SDN against adversarial learning attacks. First, we investigate generic off-the-shelf adversarial attacks to test the robustness of DDoS defenses in SDN, and demonstrate that while they lead to misclassification, these attacks do not preserve the characteristics of flows. As a result, we propose Flow-Merge for realistic adversarial flows while achieving a high evasion rate, with both targeted and untargeted misclassification attacks. The proposed Flow-Merge is able to force the DL-based DDoS defenses to misclassify 100% of benign flows as malicious, while preserving original characteristics of flows. Using state-of-the-art defenses, we show that the adversarial flows generated using Flow-Merge are difficult to detect, with only 49.31% detection rate when using adversarial training.","","978-1-7281-2319-6","10.1109/DSC47296.2019.8937669","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8937669","Intrusion Detection Systems;Deep Learning;Adversarial Machine Learning;Software Defined Networking","Perturbation methods;Computer crime;Control systems;Robustness;Software;Deep learning;Force","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;software defined networking","software-defined networking;centralized SDN controller;deep learning based algorithms;adversarial learning attacks;DL-based DDoS defenses;Flow-Merge;learning-based DDoS detection;Distributed Denial of Service defenses;misclassification attacks","","4","","32","","23 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose the first framework that can protect botnet detectors from adversarial attacks through deep reinforcement learning mechanisms. It automatically generates realistic attack samples that can evade detection, and it uses these samples to produce an augmented training set for producing hardened detectors. In such a way, we obtain more resilient detectors that can work even against unforeseen evasion attacks with the great merit of not penalizing their performance in the absence of specific attacks. We validate our proposal through an extensive experimental campaign that considers multiple machine learning algorithms and public datasets.

A set of rules are used by Signature based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) to detect hostile traffic in network segments or packets, which are so important in detecting malicious and anomalous behavior over the network like known attacks that hackers look for new techniques to go unseen. Sometime, a single failure at any layer will cause the NIDS to miss that attack. To overcome this problem, a technique is used that will trigger a failure in that layer. Such technique is known as Evasive technique. An Evasion can be defined as any technique that modifies a visible attack into any other form in order to stay away from being detect. The proposed system is used for detecting attacks which are going on the network and also gives actual categorization of attacks. The proposed system has advantage of getting low false alarm rate and high detection rate. So that leads into decrease in complexity and overhead on the system.

We propose a practical reference model for incorporating a learning analytics approach into the cybersecurity exercise life-cycle. To facilitate this application, we have performed an extensive review of existing academic research on applying learning analytics in the context of cybersecurity exercises. We specifically focus on the learning indicators used to measure empirical impact and training effectiveness that could indicate achievement of defined learning outcomes.

One of the greatest concerns is the possibility of breach in security and privacy if the device is seized by an outside party. It is possible that threats can come from friends as well as strangers. Due to the size of smart devices, they can be easily lost and may expose details of users' private lives.

Adversarial patch refers to a class of a real-world attack on a machine learning system that adds a `patch' onto the image. However, unlike existing methods, they are highly conspicuous to human perception. As these attacks are performed in the real world, they require users to manipulate the scene. However, not only the patch catches the attention of the classification system but also bystanders' attention as well. We believe that forcing the adversarial patch into the form of a scan-ready QR code can conceal its primary reason to exist in the scene. The main challenge of the research is the process of forcing an adversarial patch into a scan-ready QR code while trying to retain as much information for the patch to work as a real-world adversarial example.

A number of approaches have been developed that can render a machine learning algorithm ineffective through poisoning or other types of attacks. Most attack algorithms typically use sophisticated optimization approaches, whose objective function is designed to cause maximum damage to accuracy or performance of the algorithm with respect to some task. In this effort, we show that while such an objective function is indeed brutally effective in causing maximum damage on an embedded feature selection task, it often results in an attack mechanism that can be easily detected with an embarrassingly simple novelty or outlier detection algorithm. We then propose an equally simple yet elegant solution by adding a regularization term to the attacker's objective function that penalizes outlying attack points.","2161-4407","978-1-5090-6014-6","10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489495","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8489495","","Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Feature extraction;Mathematical model;Linear programming;Security;Anomaly detection","learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;security of data","attack strength;detectability dilemma;adversarial machine learning;machine learning algorithms;poisoning;attack mechanism;optimization approaches","","10","","38","","14 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cyber-physical attacks can cause tangible effects in the physical world. The attacker's goal is to disrupt the normal operations of the CPS for example: equipment overstress, safety limits violation, damage to the product quality, safety compliance violation etc. The continued rise of cyber-attacks together with the evolving skills of the attackers, and the inefficiency of the traditional security algorithms to defend against advanced and sophisticated attacks such as Distributed Denial of service (DDoS), slow DoS and zero-day, necessitate the development of novel defense and resilient detection techniques compared to traditional approaches like signature and behavior-based methods. To deal with this, we propose a novel approach for learning detection model that includes operational and network data to detect advanced attacks. More precisely, our approach is able to learn a relational network that connects events at different system layers so that attacks can be identified with higher confidence level. In this paper, we propose a decision model by learning a set of constraints/relations from the data that conjunctively defines the normal operation of a CPS. The solutions of the decision model characterize the normal states of a given CPS. The malicious operations are detected when one or more constraints fail for a given state of CPS. The results demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach. The main advantage of our approach is the interpretability of the model.","","978-1-7281-4034-6","10.1109/SmartWorld-UIC-ATC-SCALCOM-IOP-SCI.2019.00253","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9060371","Constraint Programming;Cyber-Physical Systems;Model learning;Anomaly detection","Data models;Feature extraction;Monitoring;Sensors;Intrusion detection;Safety","cloud computing;computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence)","cyber-physical attacks;Cyber-Physical Systems;cloud computing;malicious activities;constraint-based model;malicious operations;CPS;decision model;system layers;operational network data;detection model;behavior-based methods;resilient detection techniques;safety compliance violation;safety limits violation;normal operation;physical world","","1","","16","","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we adapt and describe a GAN method for creating network traffic data at the IP packet layer. Generating realistic network traffic is essential for development and testing of techniques in Cyber and network security related tasks such as anomaly or intrusion detection. The effectiveness of such network monitoring techniques depends directly on the traffic data. Despite this, traffic generation is often considered low priority because it is difficult. Using GANs, we prototype and prove feasibility in the generation of real traffic flows such as ICMP Pings, DNS queries, and HTTP web requests. Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) GANs, we propose an alternative encoding of network traffic data into the CNN model. Experiments show our generated traffic can be successfully transmitted through the Internet eliciting desired responses from the network.

In the context of a data-driven paradigm, this article reviews recent analytic research on cyber traffic over social networks and the Internet by using a set of common concepts of similarity, correlation, and collective indication, and by sharing security goals for classifying network host or applications and users or Tweets. The ability to do so is not determined in isolation, but rather drawn for a wide use of many different network or social flows. Furthermore, the flows exhibit many characteristics, such as fixed sized and multiple messages between source and destination. This article demonstrates a new research methodology of data-driven cyber security (DDCS) and its application in social and Internet traffic analysis.

The detection module extracts network features and analyzes them to decide whether the network is in a normal state. We use smart energy profile 2.0 specification as well as IEEE 802.15.4 standard to precisely characterize the expected normal behavior. A set of defensive actions are defined for the prevention system which are effective in stopping various attack types. HANIDPS uses Q-learning and through interactions with environment learns the best strategy against an attack. Use of model-based approach for intrusion detection and dynamic learning for intrusion prevention, as well as employment of effective mechanisms to stop the attacks, provide a high performance for HANIDPS without the need for prior knowledge of the attacks.

This generation capability can be general while the networks gain deep understanding regarding the data distribution. In many domains, this data distribution consists of anomalies and normal data, with the anomalies commonly occurring relatively less, creating datasets that are imbalanced. The capabilities that generative adversarial networks offer can be leveraged to examine these anomalies and help alleviate the challenge that imbalanced datasets propose via creating synthetic anomalies. This anomaly generation can be specifically beneficial in domains that have costly data creation processes as well as inherently imbalanced datasets. One of the domains that fits this description is the host-based intrusion detection domain. In this work, ADFA-LD dataset is chosen as the dataset of interest containing system calls of small foot-print next generation attacks. The data is first converted into images, and then a Cycle-GAN is used to create images of anomalous data from images of normal data. The generated data is combined with the original dataset and is used to train a model to detect anomalies. By doing so, it is shown that the classification results are improved, with the AUC rising from 0.55 to 0.71, and the anomaly detection rate rising from 17.07% to 80.49%. The results are also compared to SMOTE, showing the potential presented by generative adversarial networks in anomaly generation.","","978-1-5386-7693-6","10.1109/UEMCON.2018.8796769","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8796769","Anomaly Generation;Cycle-GAN;Generative Adversarial Networks;Host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS);Low foot print attacks","","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","inherently imbalanced datasets;host-based intrusion detection domain;generation attacks;anomalous data;normal data;anomaly detection rate;anomaly generation;generation capability;data distribution;synthetic anomalies;costly data creation;generative adversarial networks","","3","","9","","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, security attacks that violate safety constraints and cause accidents are a significant deterrent to achieving public trust in AVs, and that hinders a vendor's ability to deploy AVs. Creating a security hazard that results in a severe safety compromise (for example, an accident) is compelling from an attacker's perspective. In this paper, we introduce an attack model, a method to deploy the attack in the form of smart malware, and an experimental evaluation of its impact on production-grade autonomous driving software. We find that determining the time interval during which to launch the attack is{ critically} important for causing safety hazards (such as collisions) with a high degree of success.

Coupled with advancements in Deep Learning (DL), this opens up countless possibilities for meaningful applications, e.g., for medical purposes and in vehicular networks. Traditional cloud-based Machine Learning (ML) approaches require the data to be centralized in a cloud server or data center. However, this results in critical issues related to unacceptable latency and communication inefficiency. To this end, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been proposed to bring intelligence closer to the edge, where data is produced. However, conventional enabling technologies for ML at mobile edge networks still require personal data to be shared with external parties, e.g., edge servers. Recently, in light of increasingly stringent data privacy legislations and growing privacy concerns, the concept of Federated Learning (FL) has been introduced. In FL, end devices use their local data to train an ML model required by the server. The end devices then send the model updates rather than raw data to the server for aggregation. FL can serve as an enabling technology in mobile edge networks since it enables the collaborative training of an ML model and also enables DL for mobile edge network optimization. However, in a large-scale and complex mobile edge network, heterogeneous devices with varying constraints are involved. This raises challenges of communication costs, resource allocation, and privacy and security in the implementation of FL at scale. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the background and fundamentals of FL. Then, we highlight the aforementioned challenges of FL implementation and review existing solutions. Furthermore, we present the applications of FL for mobile edge network optimization.

The problem of between-class imbalance is a challenge that has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry, because of its critical influence on the performance of learning systems. Many solutions were proposed to resolve this problem: Generally, the common practice for dealing with imbalanced data sets is to rebalance them artificially by using sampling methods. In this paper, we propose a method based on Sample Selection (SS), to deal with the problem of between class imbalance. We consider that creating balance between classes by paying more attention to those examples located near the border line improves the performance of the classifier. To reduce the computational cost of selecting samples, we propose a clustering method as a first step in order to determine the critical centers, and then we select samples from those critical clusters.

Detection of malware variants can inhibit the spread of malicious code from the traditional network to the IoT, and can also inhibit the spread of malicious code within the IoT, which is of great significance to the security detection and defense of the IoT. Since the terminals and the operating systems of IoT are very different from the traditional network, when malicious code is transferred from the traditional network to the IoT platform, the characteristics of the variants may change significantly. As a result, malicious code variant detection methods for traditional platforms cannot be directly applied to the IoT. In this article, a malware variant detection method for the IoT is proposed. First, we propose a feature representation method based on RGB image for IoT to solve the problem of representation difficulty caused by platform difference, which pays more attention to the assembly code and developer information of the malware. The generated image has richer texture information, which can dig out the deep association between the IoT variants and the original malicious code. Moreover, this article improves the convolutional neural network model by combining the self-attention mechanism and spatial pyramid pooling to solve the problem of large differences in the size of IoT malware. Experimental results show that our method can be used in cross-platform to detect malware variants in the IoT effectively.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3075694","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U20B2045,U1836103,U20A20161); National Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2018YFB0804503,2019QY1400,C18613); Basic Research Program of China(grant numbers:2019-JCJQ-ZD-113); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9416280","Convolutional neural network (CNN);cross-platform;Internet of Things (IoT);malware variant detection;RGB image","Malware;Internet of Things;Feature extraction;Operating systems;Security;Telecommunications;Linux","","","","","","40","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The CPPS consists of a physical system tightly integrated with cyber systems (control, computing, and communication functions) and allows the two-way flows of electricity and information for enabling smart grid technologies. Even though the digital technologies monitoring and controlling the electric power grid more efficiently and reliably, the power grid is vulnerable to cybersecurity risk and involves the complex interdependency between cyber and physical systems. Analyzing and resolving the problems in CPPS needs the modelling methods and systematic investigation of a complex interaction between cyber and physical systems. The conventional way of modelling, simulation, and analysis involves the separation of physical domain and cyber domain, which is not suitable for the modern CPPS. Therefore, an integrated framework needed to analyze the practical scenario of the unification of physical and cyber systems. A comprehensive review of different modelling, simulation, and analysis methods and different types of cyber-attacks, cybersecurity measures for modern CPPS is explored in this paper.

Since the smart mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops are also equipped with the same communication channels (WiFi/Bluetooth), attacks on medical devices can be initiated from a compromised or malware infected mobile device. Attackers can steal confidential medical records from a wireless-enabled medical device. Medical devices or communication channels can also be compromised to feed incorrect medical records to doctors or send life threatening commands to the devices. Moreover, since the compromised mobile devices are already inside the security perimeter of a healthcare network, it is very challenging to block attacks from such compromised mobile devices. In this paper, we systematically analyze the novel threats on healthcare devices and networks, which can be initiated from compromised mobile devices.

This paper exploits the distributional learning capability of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to propose MoGAN for the prediction of user's next PoA. The generator in MoGAN uses Gated Recurrent Unit to learn the distribution of time-series data and generates the next PoA. Meanwhile, the discriminator evaluates the generated output against the real data to determine its correctness. The model is trained in adversary mode by using the output from the discriminator. The dataset utilized in training and evaluation is collected from one of the university campuses, and the results show 96.33% of prediction accuracy, which is 5% higher than the previous study.

To achieve goal of full automation (i.e., self-driving), it is important to know how AI works in AV systems. Existing research have made great efforts in investigating different aspects of applying AI in AV development. However, few studies have offered the research community a thorough examination of current practices in implementing AI in AVs. Thus, this paper aims to shorten the gap by providing a comprehensive survey of key studies in this research avenue.

Existing DTA techniques use rule-based taint-propagation, which is neither accurate (i.e., high false positive rate) nor efficient (i.e., large runtime overhead). It is hard to specify taint rules for each operation while covering all corner cases correctly. Moreover, the overtaint and undertaint errors can accumulate during the propagation of taint information across multiple operations. Finally, rule-based propagation requires each operation to be inspected before applying the appropriate rules resulting in prohibitive performance overhead on large real-world applications.In this work, we propose Neutaint, a novel end-to-end approach to track information flow using neural program embeddings. The neural program embeddings model the target's programs computations taking place between taint sources and sinks, which automatically learns the information flow by observing a diverse set of execution traces. To perform lightweight and precise information flow analysis, we utilize saliency maps to reason about most influential sources for different sinks. Neutaint constructs two saliency maps, a popular machine learning approach to influence analysis, to summarize both coarse-grained and fine-grained information flow in the neural program embeddings.We compare Neutaint with 3 state-of-the-art dynamic taint analysis tools. The evaluation results show that Neutaint can achieve 68% accuracy, on average, which is 10% improvement while reducing 40× runtime overhead over the second-best taint tool Libdft on 6 real world programs. Neutaint also achieves 61% more edge coverage when used for taint-guided fuzzing indicating the effectiveness of the identified influential bytes. We also evaluate Neutaint's ability to detect real world software attacks. The results show that Neutaint can successfully detect different types of vulnerabilities including buffer/heap/integer overflows, division by zero, etc. Lastly, Neutaint can detect 98.7% of total flows, the highest among all taint analysis tools.","2375-1207","978-1-7281-3497-0","10.1109/SP40000.2020.00022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9152790","","Tools;Fuzzing;Runtime;Neural networks;Security;Performance analysis;Task analysis","data flow analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data","neural networks;runtime execution;DTA techniques;rule-based taint-propagation;high false positive rate;taint rules;taint information;neural program embeddings model;lightweight information flow analysis;saliency maps;Neutaint constructs;taint tool Libdft;machine learning approach;fine-grained information flow;coarse-grained information flow;taint-guided fuzzing;software attacks;efficient dynamic taint analysis tools","","","","64","","30 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conventional security measures that rely on the manual analysis of security incidents and attack development inherently fail to provide a timely protection from these threats. As a consequence, computer systems often remain unprotected over longer periods of time. The field of machine learning has been considered an ideal match for this problem, as learning methods provide the ability to automatically analyze data and support early detection of threats. However, only few research has produced practical results so far and there is notable skepticism in the community about learning-based defenses. In this paper, we reconsider the problems, challenges and advantages of combining machine learning and computer security.

The algorithm's objective is to produce small changes to the data distribution defined over positive and negative class labels so that the resulting data distribution is misclassified by the CNN. The theoretical goal is to determine a manipulating change on the input data that finds learner decision boundaries where many positive labels become negative labels. Then we propose a CNN which is secure against such unforeseen changes in data. The algorithm generates adversarial manipulations by formulating a multiplayer stochastic game targeting the classification performance of the CNN. The multiplayer stochastic game is expressed in terms of multiple two-player sequential games. Each game consists of interactions between two players-an intelligent adversary and the learner CNN-such that a player's payoff function increases with interactions. Following the convergence of a sequential noncooperative Stackelberg game, each two-player game is solved for the Nash equilibrium. The Nash equilibrium finds a pair of strategies (learner weights and evolutionary operations) from which there is no incentive for either learner or adversary to deviate. We then retrain the learner over all the adversarial manipulations generated by multiple players to propose a secure CNN which is robust to subsequent adversarial data manipulations. The adversarial data and corresponding CNN performance is evaluated on MNIST handwritten digits data. The results suggest that game theory and evolutionary algorithms are very effective in securing deep learning models against performance vulnerabilities simulated as attack scenarios from multiple adversaries.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2018.2851247","The Capital Markets Cooperative Research Centre, Australia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399545","Supervised learning;data mining and knowledge discovery;evolutionary learning;adversarial learning;deep learning;stochastic optimization;game theory","Games;Training;Machine learning;Stochastic processes;Testing;Machine learning algorithms;Game theory","convolutional neural nets;data handling;decision making;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;stochastic games","adversarial deep learning models;adversarial learning algorithm;supervised classification;positive class labels;negative class labels;input data;adversarial manipulations;multiplayer stochastic game;two-player sequential games;learner CNN;sequential noncooperative Stackelberg game;Nash equilibrium;evolutionary algorithms;convolutional neural networks;data distribution;intelligent adversary;learner decision boundaries;adversarial data manipulations","","1","","31","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, these networks are typically computationally expensive to train, requiring weeks of computation on many GPUs; as a result, many users outsource the training procedure to the cloud or rely on pre-trained models that are then fine-tuned for a specific task. In this paper, we show that the outsourced training introduces new security risks: an adversary can create a maliciously trained network (a backdoored neural network, or a BadNet) that has the state-of-the-art performance on the user's training and validation samples but behaves badly on specific attacker-chosen inputs. We first explore the properties of BadNets in a toy example, by creating a backdoored handwritten digit classifier. Next, we demonstrate backdoors in a more realistic scenario by creating a U.S. street sign classifier that identifies stop signs as speed limits when a special sticker is added to the stop sign; we then show in addition that the backdoor in our U.S. street sign detector can persist even if the network is later retrained for another task and cause a drop in an accuracy of 25% on average when the backdoor trigger is present. These results demonstrate that backdoors in neural networks are both powerful and-because the behavior of neural networks is difficult to explicate-stealthy. This paper provides motivation for further research into techniques for verifying and inspecting neural networks, just as we have developed tools for verifying and debugging software.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2909068","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1801495); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8685687","Computer security;machine learning;neural networks","Training;Machine learning;Perturbation methods;Computational modeling;Biological neural networks;Security","feedforward neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);outsourcing;pattern classification","BadNet;deep neural networks;deep learning-based techniques;training procedure;pre-trained models;outsourced training;security risks;maliciously trained network;backdoored neural network;specific attacker-chosen inputs;backdoored handwritten digit classifier;street sign classifier;stop sign;street sign detector;backdoor trigger;backdooring attack evaluation","","54","","58","OAPA","11 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Methods such as machine learning-based techniques, which have been utilized with great success in various fields such as image recognition and processing, and voice recognition, are used to prevent cyberattacks caused by malware. However, several adversarial attack methods have been proposed in recent years to induce malfunctions in machine learning-based models. In this study, we focus on malware detection field and treat the aforementioned issue from the perspectives of both attackers and defenders; subsequently, we propose a novel adversarial attack method, named IMAGE_RESOURCE attack, and a robust malware detection model, respectively, using dimension reduction and machine learning techniques. The robustness of the proposed model is evaluated using portable execution (PE) surface information obtained from the FFRI Dataset 2018. During robustness evaluation, distances (e.g., Euclidean distance) between the malware and benign files are measured, and the effectiveness of IMAGE_RESOURCE attack is estimated.

To address the substantial performance and power overhead of pure software RV frameworks, this paper introduces NUVA, which stands for nonuniform verification architecture, a distributed automata-based RV architecture for parametric specifications in the form of parameterized finite-state automata, with a case study over a cache-coherent nonuniform-memory-access (ccNUMA) multiprocessor. The core of NUVA is a coherent distributed automata transactional memory (ATM) that efficiently maintains states of a dynamic population of automata checkers organized into a rooted dynamic directed acyclic graph (DAG) concurrently shared among all processor nodes. A cycle-accurate model of a ccNUMA multiprocessor confirms that performance slowdown is 1~3% and NoC message traffic increases by 10~15% at parametric event density<sup>1</sup> of 0.025 EPI for two compute-intensive scientific benchmarks having irregular concurrent data structures. The detailed architecture and implementation metrics in TSMC 40nm CMOS technology are presented. NUVA can be dimensioned to incur average total power overhead of less than 140mW and area overhead of 4mm<sup>2</sup> for a quad-core multiprocessor chip, at operating frequency of 250MHz. It is also estimated to incur 1.9~2.6% area overhead and 0.5~1% power overhead when integrated with Intel's family of high-end desktop and mobile quad-core processors operating at 1.6~3.2GHz. Our silicon implementation achieves average performance<sup>2</sup> of 1.5 MEPS/mW.

CPINDEX uses the generated logs along with the topological information about the power network configuration to build stochastic Bayesian network models of the whole cyber-physical infrastructure and update them dynamically based on the current state of the underlying power system. Finally, CPINDEX implements belief propagation algorithms on the created stochastic models combined with a novel graph-theoretic power system indexing algorithm to calculate the cyber-physical index, i.e., to measure the security-level of the system's current cyber-physical state.

Recently, the adversarial example attack, in which the input data are only slightly modified, although not an issue for human interpretation, is a serious threat to a DNN as an attack as it causes the machine to misinterpret the data. The adversarial example attack has been receiving considerable attention owing to its potential threat to machine learning. It is divided into two categories: targeted adversarial example and untargeted adversarial example. The untargeted adversarial example happens when machines misclassify an object into an incorrect class. In contrast, the targeted adversarial example attack causes machines to misinterpret the image as the attacker’s desired class. Thus, the latter is a more elaborate and powerful attack than the former. The existing targeted adversarial example is a single targeted attack that allows only one class to be recognized. However, in some cases, a multi-targeted adversarial example can be useful for an attacker to make multiple models recognize a single original image as different classes. For example, an attacker can use a single road sign generated by a multi-targeted adversarial example scheme to make model A recognize it as a stop sign and model B recognize it as a left turn, whereas a human might recognize it as a right turn. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multi-targeted adversarial example that attacks multiple models within each target class with a single modified image. To produce such examples, we carried out a transformation to maximize the probability of different target classes by multiple models. We used the MNIST datasets and TensorFlow library for our experiment. The experimental results showed that the proposed scheme for generating a multi-targeted adversarial example achieved a 100% attack success rate.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2866197","National Research Foundation of Korea; Korea Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2016R1A4A1011761,2017R1A2B4006026); Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion; Korea Government (MSIT) (Security Technologies for Financial Fraud Prevention on Fintech)(grant numbers:2016-0-00173); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8439941","Deep neural network (DNN);evasion attack;adversarial example;machine learning","Target recognition;Distortion;Machine learning;Training;Neural networks;Image recognition;Perturbation methods","image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;probability;security of data","evasion attack;deep neural network;untargeted adversarial example;targeted adversarial example attack;multitargeted adversarial example scheme;image recognition;speech recognition;pattern analysis;intrusion detection;human interpretation;machine learning;probability;tensorflow library","","14","","44","OAPA","19 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To make DL more robust, several posthoc (or runtime) anomaly detection techniques to detect (and discard) these anomalous samples have been proposed in the recent past. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection for DL based applications. We provide a taxonomy for existing techniques based on their underlying assumptions and adopted approaches. We discuss various techniques in each of the categories and provide the relative strengths and weaknesses of the approaches. Our goal in this survey is to provide an easier yet better understanding of the techniques belonging to different categories in which research has been done on this topic. Finally, we highlight the unsolved research challenges while applying anomaly detection techniques in DL systems and present some high-impact future research directions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3010274","U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory(grant numbers:DE-AC52-07NA27344); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9144212","Anomaly detection;out-of-distribution;adversarial examples;deep learning;neural network","Anomaly detection;Machine learning;Training data;Data models;Training;Neural networks;Licenses","learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","DL systems;taxonomy;post hoc anomaly detection techniques;DL based applications;out-of-distribution;deep learning;anomalous example detection","","5","","131","CCBY","20 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Indeed, attacks can be performed on the users' devices without user awareness, this represents additional risk in mission critical scenarios, such as Public Protection and Disaster Relief (PPDR). Intrusion Detection Systems are important for scenarios where information leakage is of crucial importance, since they allow to detect possible attacks to information assets (e.g., installation of malware), or can even compromise the security of PPDR personnel. HyIDS is an Hybrid IDS for Android and supporting the stringent security requirements of PPDR, by comprising agents that continuously monitor mobile device and periodically transmit the data to an analysis framework at the Command Control Center (CCC). The data collection retrieves resource usage metrics for each installed application such as CPU, memory usage, and incoming and outgoing network traffic. At the CCC, the HyIDS employs Machine Learning techniques to identify patterns that are consistent with malware signatures based on the data collected from the applications. The HyIDS's evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed solution has low impact on the mobile device in terms of battery consumption and CPU/memory usage.","","978-3-901882-89-0","10.23919/INM.2017.7987434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7987434","","Malware;Mobile handsets;Security;Performance evaluation;Monitoring;Mobile communication;Correlation","Android (operating system);learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;smart phones;telecommunication security","hybrid intrusion detection system;Android-based PPDR terminals;mobile devices;public protection and disaster relief;machine learning techniques;malware signatures","","2","","25","","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These systems are configured to detect and respond to security threats automatically there by reducing the risk to monitored computers and networks. Intrusion detection and prevention systems use different methodologies such as signature based, anomaly based, stateful protocol analysis, and a hybrid system that combines some or all of the other systems to detect and respond to security threats. The growth of systems that use a combination of methods creates some confusion when trying to choose a methodology and system to deploy. This paper seeks to offer a clear explanation of each methodology and then offer a way to compare these methodologies.","1558-058X","978-1-4673-1375-9","10.1109/SECon.2012.6197080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6197080","Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS);Anomaly Based Detection;Signature Based Detection;Stateful Protocol Analysis Based Detection;Hybrid Based Detection","Intrusion detection;Protocols;Monitoring;Accuracy;Databases;Resistance","computer network security;protocols","intrusion detection and prevention system;IDPS;computer system security threat;computer network security system;computer monitoring;protocol analysis","","17","","22","","10 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
