Resilient system designers seek objective approaches to aid in the comparison and selection of effective solutions. Decision theoretic techniques such as Markov decision processes can be leveraged for such comparisons and design decisions. Markov decision processes facilitate examination of uncertainty in system dynamics, diversity of responses, and optimization for operational objectives. This paper proposes a system design approach based in decision theory to achieve effective cyber resilience solutions. The prototypical example of a system with network intrusion detection and host reconstitution is used to illustrate this approach and highlight difficulties designers face due to the non-trivial coupling that may arise between response mechanisms.","","978-1-5090-3216-7","10.1109/NCA.2016.7778634","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7778634","","Resilience;System analysis and design;Decision theory;Markov processes;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model","decision theory;Markov processes;optimisation;security of data","decision-theoretic approach;cyber resilient systems;persistent attacks;computing systems;cyber resilience solutions;Markov decision processes;system dynamics;optimization;system design;network intrusion detection","","1","","13","","12 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A hosting service is one of the network services for outsourcing construction and maintenance of the servers. Thus, the web site operators are free from hardware setting and server maintenance. On the other hand, web sites have been exposed to cyber attacks. To counter those web site attacks, hosting service providers should monitor their web sites. However, in many cases, it is difficult for the service providers to analyze such attacks with full information because of contracts about a protection of personal information. As another approach, it is effective to construct server side honeypots and observe malicious access to them. Unfortunately, honeypots could not always observe all type of attacks because of the diversity of web sites. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for keeping up security intelligence and strengthening countermeasures against web attacks on a hosting service. Our approach helps the service providers to protect their customers web sites by combining the analysis of IDS logs and web access logs provided from these sites and dedicated honeypots for observing web attacks. The honeypots keep learning interactions from the actual hosted sites, and attract attackers by mimicking the sites to gain the intelligence on malicious web attacks. We also describe the case study in a hosting service on our university, in which suspicious requests are confirmed to be malicious by our approach.","","978-1-5090-2285-4","10.1109/AsiaJCIS.2016.32","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7782059","Hoenypot;Log Analysis;Web attack;Monitoring Network","Web sites;Security;Monitoring;Web servers;Maintenance engineering;IP networks","invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);Web sites","Wamber;Web site defense;hosting services;self-learning honeypots;server construction;server maintenance;Web site cyber attacks;personal information protection;malicious access;security intelligence;service providers;IDS log analysis;Web access logs;interactions learning","","1","","29","","15 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recognizing this challenge, this work proposes three novel methods for detecting and localizing adversarial nodes using neural network (NN) models. The methods proposed are based on fully distributed algorithms, wherein each node locally updates its local states by exchanging information with its neighbors without supervision.

The novelty of this approach lies in extracting intelligence from known real-world CPS/IoT attacks, representing them in the form of regular expressions, and employing machine learning (ML) techniques on this ensemble of regular expressions to generate new attack vectors and security vulnerabilities. Our results show that 10 new attack vectors and 122 new vulnerability exploits can be successfully generated that have the potential to exploit a CPS or an IoT ecosystem. The ML methodology achieves an accuracy of 97.4% and enables us to predict these attacks efficiently with an 87.2% reduction in the search space.

As IoT, 5G and AI continue to converge to realize the promise of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), security incidents and events on IoT networks have increased. Deep learning techniques are being applied to detect and mitigate many of such security threats against IoT networks. Feed- forward Neural Networks (FNN) have been widely used for classifying intrusion attacks in IoT networks. In this paper, we consider a variant of the FNN known as the Self-normalizing Neural Network (SNN) and compare its performance with the FNN for classifying intrusion attacks in an IoT network. Our analysis is performed using the BoT- IoT dataset from the Cyber Range Lab of the center of UNSW Canberra Cyber. In our experimental results, the FNN outperforms the SNN for intrusion detection in IoT networks based on multiple performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall as well as multi-classification metrics such as Cohen Cappaâ€™s score. However, when tested for adversarial robustness, the SNN demonstrates better resilience against the adversarial samples from the IoT dataset, presenting a promising future in the quest for safer and more secure deep learning in IoT networks.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9014337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9014337","","Machine learning;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Resilience;Internet of Things;Training","computer network security;feedforward neural nets;fuzzy neural nets;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;telecommunication security","intrusion attacks;IoT network;FNN;intrusion detection;network security applications;adversarial attacks;feedforward neural networks;self-normalizing neural network;BoT-IoT dataset;Cyber Range Lab of the center of UNSW Canberra Cyber;performance metrics","","17","","18","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, with the rapid and diverse evolution of intrusion methods, the learned knowledge is no longer suitable for new types of attacks. In addition, existing incremental learning approaches lack rapid learning capabilities and are hard to avoid potential risks and reduce property losses when there are few new samples. This can be attributed to the few-shot class-incremental intrusion detection issue. To address this issue, we propose a learning strategy, named ID-FSCIL, which could respond to the increase in attack categories by extending the origin detection system. It fully mines new intrusion patterns from few samples with meta-learning and maximizes the model’s generalization ability to deal with emerging attacks. Our evaluations show that ID-FSCIL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on the NSL-KDD dataset under incremental learning settings.","2637-9430","978-1-6654-1278-0","10.1109/ICCCN52240.2021.9522260","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9522260","intrusion detection;few-shot;incremental learning;deep Neural Networks;meta-learning","Training;Computer hacking;Computational modeling;Network intrusion detection;Machine learning;Sparks;Research and development","","","","","","26","","31 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, many of the current protection mechanisms are either platform dependent or are effective only against a reduced set of attacks. In this work, we present Guard-NoC, a secure Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture able to protect MPSoCs against a wide variety of LSCAs. The secure NoC employs three application-independent strategies to hide and isolate sensitive information: i) blinding the execution time of operations; ii) masking the execution time of operations; and iii) dual communication strategy (i.e., use packet and circuit switching simultaneously).

Due to the critical nature of AMI, threats have been targeted towards it and a need of tailored defense mechanism has been highlighted in the recent studies. Since limited number of protocols and applications are supported in the AMI, it exhibits a predictable and deterministic behavior. This predictability makes it easier for an attacker to learn the network behavior and launch an evasion attack by generating similar traffic. To combat this, we present a mutable AMI configuration technique for Proactive Defense. We randomize three different configuration parameters in order to make the AMI behavior unpredictable.While providing the randomization, the approach stays deterministic for the AMI devices like smart collector in order to detect any evasion attempts. We use real-world dataset comprising of approximately 2000 meters collected at an AMI of a leading utility provider for analysis.

To this extent, we present a traffic recognition approach that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first non-intrusive method to detect traffic patterns directly from the radio spectrum, contrary to traditional packet-based analysis methods. In particular, we designed a Deep Learning (DL) architecture that differentiates between Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) traffic, burst traffic with different duty cycles, and traffic with varying rates of transmission. As input to these models, we explore the use of images representing the spectrum in time and time-frequency. Furthermore, we present a novel data randomization approach to generate realistic synthetic data that combines two state-of-the-art simulators.

In addition, recent sophisticated insider attacks resulted in the exfiltration of highly classified information to the public. Traditional security solutions have failed repeatedly to mitigate such threats. In order to defend against such sophisticated adversaries we need to redesign our defences, developing technologies focused more on detection than prevention.

The ARCD approach is based on the differentiation between the predefined standard resource consumption pattern and the anomalous consumption pattern of system resource utilization. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested in a rigorous manner by simulating four types of cyberattacks: a denial-of-service attack, a brute-force attack, a remote code execution attack, and a man-in-the-middle attack, which are executed on a Smart PiCar (used as the testbed). A septenary tuple model consisting of seven parameters, representing the embedded system's architecture, has been created as the core of the detection mechanism. The approach's efficiency and effectiveness has been validated in terms of range and pattern by analyzing the collected data statistically in terms of mean, median, mode, standard deviation, range, minimum, and maximum values. The results demonstrated the potential for defining a standard pattern of resource utilization and performance of the embedded system due to a significant similarity of the parameters' values at normal states. In contrast, the attacked cases showed a definite, observable, and detectable impact on resource consumption and performance of the embedded system, causing an anomalous pattern. Thus, by merging these two findings, the ARCD approach has been developed. ARCD facilitates building secure operating systems in line with the ES's capabilities. Furthermore, the ARCD approach can work along with existing countermeasures to augment the security of the operating system layer.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3088395","Centre of Autonomous and Cyber Physical Systems, School of Aerospace, Transport and Manufacturing (SATM), Cranfield University, Bedford, U.K.; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9452174","Anomalous resource consumption;brute-force attack;cyberattacks;denial-of-service attack;embedded systems;password attack;remote code execution;testbed","Security;Computer crime;Embedded systems;Memory management;Standards;Monitoring;Voltage measurement","computer crime;data analysis;embedded systems;operating systems (computers);resource allocation;statistical analysis","embedded system;ARCD;secure operating systems;operating system layer;cyberattack detection;resource utilization;predefined standard resource consumption pattern;anomalous consumption pattern;system resource utilization;denial-of-service attack;brute-force attack;remote code execution attack;man-in-the-middle attack;anomalous resource consumption detection;embedded systems;Smart PiCar;data statistical analysis","","","","28","CCBYNCND","11 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Identifying and classifying different types of CAAs in a timely manner is a great challenge because of the inherently shared nature and randomness of the wireless medium. To overcome the difficulties encountered in existing methods, such as long latency, high data collection overhead, and limited applicable range, a deep learning-based CAA detection framework is proposed in this paper. First, we show the challenges of CAA classification by analyzing the impacts of CAAs on wireless network performance using an event-driven network simulator. Second, a state-transition model is built for the channel access process at a node, whose output sequences characterize the changing patterns of the node's transmission status in different CAA scenarios. Third, a deep learning-based CAA classification framework is presented, which takes state transition sequences of a node as input and outputs predicted CAA types. The performance of three deep neural networks, i.e., fully-connected, convolutional, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, for classifying CAAs are evaluated under our CAA classification framework in five CAA scenarios and the normal scenario without CAA. Experimental results show that LSTM outperforms the other two neural network architectures, and its CAA classification accuracy is higher than 95%. We successfully transferred the learned LSTM model to classify CAAs on other nodes in the same network and the nodes in other networks, which verifies the generality of our proposed framework.","2575-8411","978-1-7281-7002-2","10.1109/ICDCS47774.2020.00031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9355808","Wireless networks;Channel access attack;Classification;Deep learning;Long short-term memory","Training;Wireless networks;Neural networks;Transfer learning;Prototypes;Media;Distributed computing","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;radio networks;recurrent neural nets;telecommunication security","event-driven network simulator;deep neural networks;wireless networks;channel access attack classification;smart applications;deep learning-based CAA detection;state transition sequences;fully-connected neural network;convolutional neural network;long short-term memory network;LSTM network","","","","21","","23 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we propose a novel composite method to filter image-based spam accurately and effectively, which can be easily implemented as a plug-in in SpamAssassin. Our method takes advantage of the two natures of image-based spams: large quantity, similarity and character variability. For the first nature, we use rules of SpamAssassin to detect the emails characteristic. If a new email has been identified as spam by the rules, it will be blocked. Otherwise, image-based mail will be captured by the plug-in. For the second nature,the plug-in will use multifractal analysis in multi-orientation wavelet pyramid algorithm to get image-based email texture descriptor which has strong invariance to many factors, use a hybrid filter-wrapper feature subset selection algorithm based on particle swarm optimization to reduce some redundant or irrelevant features in the texture descriptor, and use a semi-supervised support vector machines classification algorithm to detect whether an email is ham or spam, then use active learning clustering to get the most representative emails for relabeling through user feedback. The relabeled emails by users feedback and the unlabeled suspect spams by SVM will be used to retrain the classification for improving accuracy of spam filter. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is of high efficiency, high accuracy and low false positive rate. The accuracy will be improved and the false positive rate will be reduced along with more and more retraining. So, the method is fit especially for an adversarial learning and processing like spam filtering.","","978-1-4799-1660-3","10.1109/ANTHOLOGY.2013.6784950","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6784950","Image-Based Spam;Multifractal Analysis;Active Learning Cluseting;Feedback-Driven Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machine","Educational institutions;Support vector machines;Filtering algorithms;Electronic mail;Lead;Fractals;Feature extraction","","","","2","","18","","10 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It also makes network functions and services much more adaptive and scalable. Despite the promising advantages of NFV, security remains to be one of the vital concerns and potential hurdle, as attack surface becomes unclear and defense line turns to be blurred in the virtualization environment. This survey is therefore devoted to analyzing NFV from a security perspective. We first analyze security threats of five well-defined NFV use cases, with an objective to establishing a comprehensive layer-specific threat taxonomy. Second, we conduct in-depth comparative studies on several security mechanisms that are applied in traditional scenarios and in NFV environments. The purpose is to analyze their implicit relationships with NFV performance objectives in terms of feasibility, agility, effectiveness, and so on. Third, based on the established threat taxonomy and the analyzed security mechanisms, we provide a set of recommendations on securing NFV based services, along with the analysis on the state-of-the-art security countermeasures.

Based on the MSDND analysis, this work offers a thorough documentation on the vulnerable points of attack, invariants used for removing the vulnerabilities, and suggested design decisions that help in developing invariants to mitigate attacks.","2473-3105","978-1-5386-5700-3","10.1109/PRDC.2018.00022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8639514","cyber physical security;invariants;information flow;msdnd;design;cyber security","Security;Integrated circuits;Actuators;Monitoring;Sensor systems;Cost accounting","critical infrastructures;cyber-physical systems;industrial control;public utilities;security of data;water treatment","cyberphysical systems;critical infrastructure;gas plants;cyber attacks;physical sensors;communications network;critical information;MSDND analysis;multistage water treatment;water treatment plant;formal analysis;industrial control system;water treatment testbed;multiple security domain nondeducibility model;ICS;STUXNET virus","","2","","21","","14 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose PeerShark, a novel methodology to detect P2P botnet traffic and differentiate it from benign P2P traffic in a network. Instead of the traditional 5-tuple 'flow-based' detection approach, we use a 2-tuple 'conversation-based' approach which is port-oblivious, protocol-oblivious and does not require Deep Packet Inspection.

The introduction of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) separated these planes, and provided additional features and tools to solve some of the problems of traditional network (i.e., latency, consistency, efficiency). SDN is a flexible networking paradigm that boosts network control, programmability and automation. It proffers many benefits in many areas, including routing. More specifically, for efficiently organizing, managing and optimizing routing in networks, some intelligence is required, and SDN offers the possibility to easily integrate it. To this purpose, many researchers implemented different machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance SDN routing applications. This article surveys the use of ML techniques for routing optimization in SDN based on three core categories (i.e. supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning). The main contributions of this survey are threefold. Firstly, it presents detailed summary tables related to these studies and their comparison is also discussed, including a summary of the best works according to our analysis. Secondly, it summarizes the main findings, best works and missing aspects, and it includes a quick guideline to choose the best ML technique in this field (based on available resources and objectives). Finally, it provides specific future research directions divided into six sections to conclude the survey. Our conclusion is that there is a huge trend to use intelligence-based routing in programmable networks, particularly during the last three years, but a lot of effort is still required to achieve comprehensive comparisons and synergies of approaches, meaningful evaluations based on open datasets and topologies, and detailed practical implementations (following recent standards) that could be adopted by industry. In summary, future efforts should be focused on reproducible research rather than on new isolated ideas. Otherwise, most of these applications will be barely implemented in practice.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3099092","Comunidad de Madrid through the project TAPIR-CM(grant numbers:S2018/TCS-4496); project IRIS-CM(grant numbers:CM/JIN/2019-039); Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha through the project IRIS-JCCM(grant numbers:SBPLY/19/180501/000324); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9493245","Software-defined networking;machine learning;routing;optimization;survey","Routing;Optimization;Machine learning;Market research;Terminology;Security;Reinforcement learning","software defined networking;supervised learning;telecommunication network routing;unsupervised learning","routing optimization;control plane;data plane;Software-Defined Networking;flexible networking paradigm;network control;machine learning techniques;SDN routing applications;ML technique;unsupervised learning;reinforcement learning;intelligence-based routing;programmable networks","","","","201","CCBY","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We collect error statistics of the output estimation during the learning phase of system operation and after that, monitor the system behavior to see if it significantly deviates from the expected outputs. A compensating controller is further designed to intervene and replace the classic controller once the attack is detected.

IoT has become a popular target for attackers seeking sensitive and personal user data, computing infrastructure for massive attacks, or aimed at compromising critical applications. Worryingly, the industrial race toward the forefront of IoT software and device development has led to increased market penetration of vulnerable IoT devices and applications. Nevertheless, traditional cybersecurity solutions designed for personal computers often rely on heavy computation and high communication overhead, and therefore are prohibitive for IoT, given the explosive number of IoT devices, their resource-con-strained nature, and their heterogeneity. Hence, innovative solutions must be designed for securing IoT applications, while considering the peculiar characteristics of IoT devices and networks. In this article, we discuss the motivations and challenges of using machine learning (ML) models for the design of cybersecurity solutions for IoT. More specifically, we tackle the challenge of designing ML-based solutions and provide guidelines for ML-based physical layer solutions aimed at securing IoT. We propose a device-oriented and network-oriented classification and investigate recent works that designed ML-based solutions, considering IoT physical layer features, to secure IoT applications. The proposed classification helps engineers and practitioners starting in this area to better identify and understand the challenges, requirements, and up-to-date common design principles for securing IoT devices and networks considering physical layer features.

Toward that end a project is underway to catalog re-usable patterns of self-organizing security of many kinds, principally found in natural systems, but also seen in recent computational approaches. One class of pattern of special interest involves discovery of previously unseen threats and attacks. In general this class of pattern has aspects of learning, innovation, and evolution as capability objectives. The genetic algorithm is one such pattern. Another such pattern is seen in artificial neural networks. Combining the two into a Genetic Algorithm augmented Neural Network, often called GANN, has considerable recent history in the literature. Not many of these are directly related to security applications. Some security-application work shows GANNs employed for feature selection provide enhanced learning performance and accuracy, and avoidance of local minimum traps.

Manual detection of malware is not cost-effective and cannot keep up with the fast evolution of malware development in Android. A machine learning based malware detection has attempted to automate the detection of malware in Android. In this paper, we present new Android malware detection methods. The main idea of our proposed approach is to use three different feature selection methods before malware detection model using a machine learning algorithm is constructed. We used both Malware Genome Project dataset and our own crawled dataset to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","","978-1-5386-9210-3","10.1109/ICSSA45270.2018.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9092087","Android, Feature Selection, Machine Learning, Malware detection, Random Forest","Malware;Feature extraction;Forestry;Androids;Humanoid robots;Machine learning algorithms;Smart phones","Android (operating system);feature selection;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence)","feature selections;random forest;malicious software applications;Android ecosystem;fast evolution;malware development;Android malware detection methods;feature selection methods;detection model;machine learning algorithm;malware genome project dataset","","","","10","","14 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among the recent advanced application-layer DDoS attacks, the Very Short Intermittent DDoS (VSI-DDoS) is the attack, which can bypass existing detection systems and significantly degrade the QoS experienced by users of web services. However, in order for the VSI-DDoS attack to work effectively, bots participating in the attack should be tightly synchronized, an assumption that is difficult to be met in reality. In this paper, we conducted a quantitative analysis to understand how a minimal deviation from perfect synchronization in botnets affects the performance and effectiveness of the VSI-DDoS attack. We found that VSI-DDoS became substantially less effective. That is, it lost 85.7% in terms of effectiveness under about 90ms synchronization inaccuracy, which is a very small inaccuracy under normal network conditions.","","978-1-5386-7493-2","10.1109/PST.2018.8514210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8514210","DDoS;time synchronization;evaluation","Computer crime;Synchronization;Servers;Botnet;Quality of service;Time factors;Web services","computer network security;Internet;quality of service;Web services","distributed denial-of-service;Internet-based services;application-layer DDoS attacks;Web services;very short intermittent DDoS attack;perfect synchronization;QoS;VSI-DDoS attack","","1","","45","","1 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Through the analysis of big data collected from users' submission, we can discover many other applications of fingerprint positioning. A popular application is the check-in to point of interest (POI) for its crowd traffic evaluation according to the volume of received signal strength (RSS) fingerprints submitted by users. However, this crowd traffic evaluation method may be susceptible to the intrusion of malicious check-in behaviors. Attackers who are not at the target POI submit the self-modification RSS fingerprints that can be located at the target POI in order to illegally increase its crowd traffic. To this end, we propose a malicious check-in defense scheme based on the access point (AP) selection to resist attackers who aim to successfully initiate the fingerprint modification. Specifically, the distance between different POIs in fingerprint space is firstly developed for AP selection. Then, in order to increase the robustness of selected AP subset, we propose the mutual information among different classes as a selection condition. Through the multiobjective optimization and Pareto optimality, we can obtain the best AP subset to participate in the computation of positioning algorithm. Furthermore, the optimal modified fingerprint is searched by the level set method (LSM), which can be utilized to measure the costs of attackers and the robustness of the system. In addition, we propose an iterative weight updating method based on classification error to learn the optimal weight in order to balance the positioning accuracy and robustness. We finally carry out extensive simulations to validate that the POI crowd traffic can be assessed in terms of the RSS fingerprint-related information and our proposed scheme can perform high robustness to resist malicious check-in.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2020.3014384","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1808207,91746114); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project(grant numbers:D18003); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(grant numbers:18510761000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9159905","Fingerprint positioning;big data analytics;AP selection;crowd traffic evaluation;robustness","Wireless fidelity;Robustness;Big Data;Feature extraction;Optimization;Data analysis;Mobile handsets","Big Data;computer network security;data analysis;indoor navigation;iterative methods;Pareto optimisation;pattern classification;radionavigation;RSSI;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","received signal strength fingerprints;crowd traffic evaluation method;malicious check-in behaviors;target POI;self-modification RSS fingerprints;malicious check-in defense scheme;fingerprint modification;fingerprint space;AP selection;selected AP subset;selection condition;positioning algorithm;optimal modified fingerprint;iterative weight updating method;positioning accuracy;POI crowd traffic;RSS fingerprint-related information;Big Data analysis;indoor positioning system;access point selection approach;WiFi fingerprint-based indoor positioning technology;fingerprint positioning;point of interest;multiobjective optimization;Pareto optimality","","9","","52","IEEE","5 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For better performance, a large amount of dataset has been used for training the DL algorithms. As DL has been remained a key element in the performance of the application, hence, several privacy and security issues have reported, which have affected the performance. Such security attacks have also affected the performance by taking the advantage of the huge dataset, because it is easy for an attacker to add executable noise into the dataset to get the information of the dataset and the model used. Most common security attacks like poisoning and evasion attacks have been considered challenging attacks that have caused misclassification and wrong prediction. Hence, a secure metric is needed to mitigate the effects of such attacks from the dataset. Therefore, in this paper, a light-weight watermarking framework has been proposed that provides security to the dataset before training the DL algorithms. We have implemented our proposed framework using the most common Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) against security attacks. The proposed framework has been evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and computational cost, and has maintained the accuracy up to 98.89% and a precision of 0.96, which has maintained the level as in recent literature. We have also reduced the computational cost for the proposed framework.

However, existing IDS solutions are limited to detect abnormal network behaviors under local sub-networks rather than the entire VANET. To address this problem, we utilize deep learning with generative adversarial networks and explore distributed SDN to design a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) for VANETs, which enables multiple SDN controllers jointly train a global intrusion detection model for the entire network without directly exchanging their sub-network flows. We prove the correctness of our CIDS in both IID (Independent Identically Distribution) and non-IID situations, and also evaluate its performance through both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset.

In this paper, we propose a novel scalable botnet detection system capable of detecting stealthy P2P botnets. Our system first identifies all hosts that are likely engaged in P2P communications.

On the other hand, as technology evolves, its abuse will increase, and attacks on data exploitation will become more and more diverse. The main weaknesses of distributed and IoT systems, which are their computing power and power, will remain the same, and hackers will make the most of these weaknesses and will use new methods and ways to anonymize their activities. So there is a need for a system to identify and counter potential abuses of capabilities and data volume in next generation networks, especially 5G and 6G, more than ever.

We propose an approach to achieve this for cloud software systems based on relationships between defense strength, exploitability of vulnerabilities, and attack severity. We extend the concept of entailment relationship from the field of requirements engineering with the satisfiability aspects of security requirements. The proposed approach enables us to systematically structure security concepts into three sets of related descriptions to quantify the satisfaction level of security requirements with the deployed security solutions. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, we evaluate the approach in a case study.

However, ML/DL has shown to be extremely vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially in such security-sensitive systems. Many adversarial attacks have been proposed to evaluate the robustness of ML-based NIDSs. Unfortunately, existing attacks mostly focused on feature-space and/or white-box attacks, which make impractical assumptions in real-world scenarios, leaving the study on practical gray/black-box attacks largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first systematic study of the gray/black-box traffic-space adversarial attacks to evaluate the robustness of ML-based NIDSs. Our work outperforms previous ones in the following aspects: (i) practical -the proposed attack can automatically mutate original traffic with extremely limited knowledge and affordable overhead while preserving its functionality; (ii) generic -the proposed attack is effective for evaluating the robustness of various NIDSs using diverse ML/DL models and non-payload-based features; (iii) explainable -we propose an explanation method for the fragile robustness of ML-based NIDSs. Based on this, we also propose a defense scheme against adversarial attacks to improve system robustness. We extensively evaluate the robustness of various NIDSs using diverse feature sets and ML/DL models. Experimental results show our attack is effective (e.g., >97% evasion rate in half cases for Kitsune, a state-of-the-art NIDS) with affordable execution cost and the proposed defense method can effectively mitigate such attacks (evasion rate is reduced by >50% in most cases).","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2021.3087242","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1800200); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9448103","Network anomaly detection;network intrusion detection systems;adversarial machine learning;machine learning security;evasion attack","Robustness;Feature extraction;Malware;Detectors;Deep learning;Adversarial machine learning;Upper bound","computer network security;deep learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic","ML-based NIDS;nonpayload-based features;fragile robustness;system robustness;machine learning;deep learning techniques;anomaly-based network intrusion detection systems;security-sensitive systems;adversarial robustness;adversarial attacks;feature-space;white-box attacks;gray-black-box attacks;gray-black-box traffic-space;diverse ML-DL models;diverse feature sets;Kitsune half cases","","","","60","IEEE","7 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, these ECUs also bring security vulnerabilities because their communication follows the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol that was designed without supporting message origin authentication. Several methods to resolve this problem have been proposed in the literature, but most of them would require heavy communications and calculations to support the cryptography algorithms. In this paper, we propose a delay-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to protect the CAN network by identifying the location of the compromised ECU for the in-vehicle network. We develop and implement our detection method on CAN bus prototype, and our results show that our method is capable of an overall detection accuracy above 97%.

In this work, we present Adept, a distributed framework to detect and identify the individual attack stages in a coordinated attack. Adept works in three phases. First, network traffic of IoT devices is processed locally for detecting anomalies with respect to their benign profiles. Any alert corresponding to a potential anomaly is sent to a security manager, where aggregated alerts are mined, using frequent itemset mining (FIM), for detecting patterns correlated across both time and space. Finally, using both alert-level and pattern-level information as features, we employ a machine learning approach to identify individual attack stages in the generated alerts.

The success of NIDS is highly dependent on the performance of the algorithms and improvement methods used to increase the classification accuracy and decrease the training and testing times of the algorithms. We propose an effective deep learning approach, self-taught learning (STL)-IDS, based on the STL framework. The proposed approach is used for feature learning and dimensionality reduction. It reduces training and testing time considerably and effectively improves the prediction accuracy of support vector machines (SVM) with regard to attacks. The proposed model is built using the sparse autoencoder mechanism, which is an effective learning algorithm for reconstructing a new feature representation in an unsupervised manner. After the pre-training stage, the new features are fed into the SVM algorithm to improve its detection capability for intrusion and classification accuracy. Moreover, the efficiency of the approach in binary and multiclass classification is studied and compared with that of shallow classification methods, such as J48, naive Bayesian, random forest, and SVM. Results show that our approach has accelerated SVM training and testing times and performed better than most of the previous approaches in terms of performance metrics in binary and multiclass classification.

At present, the complexity, proliferation, and variety of malware pose a real challenge for the existing countermeasures and require their constant improvements. That is why, in this paper we first perform a detailed meta-review of the existing surveys related to malware and its detection techniques, showing an arms race between these two sides of a barricade. On this basis, we review the evolution of modern threats in the communication networks, with a particular focus on the techniques employing information hiding.

Unfortunately, this is not the case, as several examples of successful attacks carried out in the last decade, and more frequently in the very recent past, have dramatically shown.

And ransomware is considered one of the main categories of cybercrime. The Wannacry ransomware attack broken out in 2017 is one of the largest ransomware attacks in history, creating huge threats to the data security of individual users and enterprises. Since 2017, although the principle of Wannacry has been figured comprehensively and numerous detection and defense methods have been proposed, all of these existing methods have some defects. Therefore, we propose to build a comprehensive detection approach of Wannacry with a set of rules, which is named Comprehensive Wannacry Detection Rules (CWDR). Through principle analysis, we extract the traffic features. And these features can be easily distinguished from other normal traffic information during the Wannacry attack. Base on these traffic features, a set of rules is designed to detect the attack process of Wannacry. CWDR rule set can detect Wannacry at all 8 stages through network traffic monitoring. Finally, we instantiate the rule set using Suricata and do benchmark experiments with ET Open rule set and Snort rule set. In the basic experiment, the False Negative Rate of the CWDR rule set, ET Open rule set, and Snort rule set are 0%, 25%, 50%. In the evasion experiment, the False Negative Rate of the CWDR rule set, ET Open rule set, and Snort rule set are 12.5%, 75%, 62.5%. The results show that the CWDR rule set can detect the attack process of Wannacry ransomware more precisely.","","978-1-7281-8448-7","10.1109/CyberC49757.2020.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9329407","Wannacry ransomware;principle analysis;Intrusion detection;Suricata","Telecommunication traffic;Feature extraction;Knowledge discovery;Ransomware;History;Computer crime;Monitoring","computer crime;feature extraction;invasive software","ET Open rule set;Snort rule set;CWDR rule set;cybercrime;Wannacry ransomware attack;traffic feature extraction;comprehensive Wannacry detection rules;cybersecurity;data security;Suricata","","","","34","","27 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We will call this new field cyber-physical security. The tight coupling between information and communication technologies and physical systems introduces new security concerns, requiring a rethinking of the commonly used objectives and methods. Existing security approaches are either inapplicable, not viable, insufficiently scalable, incompatible, or simply inadequate to address the challenges posed by highly complex environments such as the smart grid.

Commonly used signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) struggle to distinguish between these processes and are thus only of limited use to detect such attacks. They also have the shortcoming that they need to be updated frequently to possess the latest malware definitions. This makes them inherently prone to missing novel attack techniques. Misuse detection IDSs however overcome this problem by maintaining a ground truth of normal application behavior while reporting deviations as anomalies. In our approach, we try to accomplish this by observing a process' memory consumption. This is for two reasons: We expect the readings to be less volatile in comparison to for instance network operations. Second, by breaking the problem down, we are able to investigate thoroughly while still laying the foundations for future expansion. We use the observations from a given host to train a machine learning algorithm. After an initial learning phase, we evaluate the model with readings from the application it has been trained on and other applications in order to assess its quality. Our results indicate that the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on parametrizing the machine learning algorithm appropriately. A large variance in accuracy with only slightly altered inputs confirms this suggestion. We finish with a discussion on deploying such an IDS at scale in a realistic scenario.","","978-1-5090-6356-7","10.1109/THS.2017.7943508","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7943508","","Training;Malware;Memory management;Data models;Intrusion detection;Time series analysis","invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);program diagnostics;security of data","disguised processes detection;application-behavior profiling;malware detection;system process hijacking;used signature-based intrusion detection systems;IDS;malware definitions;normal application behavior ground truth;process memory consumption;machine learning algorithm parametrization","","3","6","31","","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, developing an effective CIDS, particularly for the IoT ecosystem raises several challenges. Recent trends and advances in blockchain technology, which provides assurance in distributed trust and secure immutable storage, may contribute towards the design of effective CIDS. In this poster abstract, we present our ongoing work on a decentralized CIDS for IoT, which is based on blockchain technology. We propose an architecture that provides accountable trust establishment, which promotes incentives and penalties, and scalable intrusion information storage by exchanging bloom filters.

This imbalance is because these systems' reliability requirements make the occurrence of an anomaly a rare phenomenon. Hence, most datasets on anomaly detection have a relatively small percentage that captures the anomaly. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GAN) have shown promising results in image generation tasks. Therefore, in this research work, we build on conditional GANs (CGAN) to generate plausible distributions of a given profile to solve the challenge of data imbalance in anomaly detection tasks and present a novel framework for anomaly detection. Firstly, we learn the pattern of the minority class data samples using a single class CGAN. Secondly, we use the knowledge base of the single class CGAN to generate samples that augment the minority class samples so that a binary class CGAN can train on the typical and malicious profiles with a balanced dataset. This approach inherently eliminates the bias imposed on algorithms from the dataset and results in a robust framework with improved generalization. Thirdly, the binary class CGAN generates a knowledge base that we use to construct the cluster-based anomaly detector. During testing, we do not use the single class CGAN, thereby providing us with a lean and efficient algorithm for anomaly detection that can do anomaly detection on semi-supervised and non-parametric multivariate data. We test the framework on logs and image-based anomaly detection datasets with class imbalance. We compare the performance of AD-CGAN with GAN-derived and non-GAN-derived state of the art algorithms on benchmark datasets. AD-CGAN outperforms most of the algorithms in the standard metrics of Precision, Recall, and F-1 Score. Where AD-CGAN does not perform better in the parameters used, it has the advantage of being lightweight. Therefore, it can be deployed for both online and offline anomaly detection tasks since it does not use an input sample inversion strategy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3025530","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9201442","Anomaly detection;transfer learning;deep learning;generative adversarial networks","Anomaly detection;Machine learning;Hidden Markov models;Generative adversarial networks;Gallium nitride;Data models;Context modeling","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;sampling methods;security of data","AD-CGAN;conditional generative adversarial networks;image generation tasks;anomaly detection tasks;minority class data samples;single class CGAN;knowledge base;minority class samples;binary class CGAN;cluster-based anomaly detector;image-based anomaly detection datasets;class imbalance","","","","39","CCBY","21 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This data provides a plethora of potential use cases for AI and machine learning that can help plant operators better understand and predict complex plant situations and thereby run their plants more effectively and safely. A relevant use case is anomaly detection, due to the time and cost-intensive process of detecting and rectifying issues, e.g., plant equipment failures. In this paper, the anomaly detection problem for multivariate industrial time-series data is addressed with the help of neural network architectures. In particular, three architectures are evaluated and compared: Dense Autoencoders, LSTM Autoencoders, and LSTMs. The evaluation is performed to detect 20 simulated plant equipment failures for a real-world industrial process found in oil production fields, called the three-phase separator process. The evaluation is done by 1) measuring to what extent the anomaly detection models succeed in detecting the anomalies, and 2) how well the models are able to explain the anomaly root cause. The main contribution of this paper is to find an anomaly detection model that is best suited for the detection and explanation of various failure cases in such an industrial process setting. The evaluation results show the quantitative comparison of the three models metrics and their performances.

The rapid development of IoT to most corners of life, however, leads to various emerging cybersecurity threats. Therefore, detecting and preventing potential attacks in IoT networks have recently attracted paramount interest from both academia and industry. Among various attack detection approaches, machine learning-based methods, especially deep learning, have demonstrated great potential thanks to their early detecting capability. However, these machine learning techniques only work well when a huge volume of data from IoT devices with label information can be collected. Nevertheless, the labeling process is usually time consuming and expensive, thus, it may not be able to adapt with quick evolving IoT attacks in reality. In this paper, we propose a novel deep transfer learning (DTL) method that allows to learn from data collected from multiple IoT devices in which not all of them are labeled. Specifically, we develop a DTL model based on two AutoEncoders (AEs). The first AE (AE<sub>1</sub>) is trained on the source datasets (source domains) in the supervised mode using the label information and the second AE (AE<sub>2</sub>) is trained on the target datasets (target domains) in an unsupervised manner without label information. The transfer learning process attempts to force the latent representation (the bottleneck layer) of AE<sub>2</sub> similarly to the latent representation of AE<sub>1</sub>.

In spite of specific behaviors each botnet has, there exist adequate similarities inside each botnet that separate its behavior from benign traffic. Several botnet detection systems have been proposed based on these similarities. However, offering a solution for differentiating botnet traffic (even those using same protocol, e.g. IRC) from normal traffic is not trivial. Extraction of features in either host or network level to model a botnet has been one of the most popular methods in botnet detection. A subset of features, usually selected based on some intuitive understanding of botnets, is used by the machine learning algorithms to classify/ cluster botnet traffic. These approaches, tested against two or three botnet traces, have mostly showed satisfactory detection results. Even though, their effectiveness in detection of other botnets or real traffic remains in doubt. Additionally, effectiveness of different combination of features in terms of providing more detection coverage has not been fully studied. In this paper we revisit flow-based features employed in the existing botnet detection studies and evaluate their relative effectiveness. To ensure a proper evaluation we create a dataset containing a diverse set of botnet traces and background traffic.","","978-1-4799-5890-0","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997492","","Feature extraction;Protocols;Accuracy;Ports (Computers);IP networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Security","invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence)","feature selection;machine learning;botnet detection;cyber security threat;botnet traffic;flow-based feature","","46","","40","","29 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The reason behind the vast adoption of WSNs in various applications is that they have tremendously appealing features, e.g., low production cost, low installation cost, unattended network operation, autonomous and longtime operation. WSNs have started to merge with the Internet of Things (IoT) through the introduction of Internet access capability in sensor nodes and sensing ability in Internet-connected devices. Thereby, the IoT is providing access to huge amount of data, collected by the WSNs, over the Internet. Hence, the security of IoT should start with foremost securing WSNs ahead of the other components. However, owing to the absence of a physical line-of-defense, i.e., there is no dedicated infrastructure such as gateways to watch and observe the flowing information in the network, security of WSNs along with IoT is of a big concern to the scientific community. More specifically, for the application areas in which CIA (confidentiality, integrity, availability) has prime importance, WSNs and emerging IoT technology might constitute an open avenue for the attackers. Besides, recent integration and collaboration of WSNs with IoT will open new challenges and problems in terms of security. Hence, this would be a nightmare for the individuals using these systems as well as the security administrators who are managing those networks. Therefore, a detailed review of security attacks towards WSNs and IoT, along with the techniques for prevention, detection, and mitigation of those attacks are provided in this paper. In this text, attacks are categorized and treated into mainly two parts, most or all types of attacks towards WSNs and IoT are investigated under that umbrella: “Passive Attacks” and “Active Attacks”. Understanding these attacks and their associated defense mechanisms will help paving a secure path towards the proliferation and public acceptance of IoT technology.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2019.2953364","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8897627","Blockchain;CoAP;cryptography;detection;DoS;intrusion;IoT;MQTT;prevention;RPL;survey;TSCH;WSN;6LowPAN;6LowPSec;6TiSCH","Wireless sensor networks;Security;Internet of Things;Monitoring;Wireless communication;Privacy","computer network management;computer network security;Internet;Internet of Things;wireless sensor networks","wireless sensor networks;Internet access capability;Internet-connected devices;WSN;security attacks;IoT technology;Internet of Things;passive attacks;active attacks","","38","","188","IEEE","13 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Energy theft is one of the most important concerns related to the smart grid implementation. It is estimated that utility companies lose more than $25 billion every year due to energy theft around the world. To address this challenge, in this paper, we discuss the background of AMI and identify major security requirements that AMI should meet. Specifically, an attack tree based threat model is first presented to illustrate the energy-theft behaviors in AMI. Then, we summarize the current AMI energy-theft detection schemes into three categories, i.e., classification-based, state estimation-based, and game theory-based ones, and make extensive comparisons and discussions on them. In order to provide a deep understanding of security vulnerabilities and solutions in AMI and shed light on future research directions, we also explore some open challenges and potential solutions for energy-theft detection.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2014.6787363","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6787363","smart grid;Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI);security;energy-theft detection","Electricity;Companies;Smart grids;Security;Wide area networks;Power system reliability;Reliability","game theory;metering;power system measurement;power system protection;power system state estimation;smart power grids","AMI energy-theft detection Issue;advanced metering infrastructure security;smart grid proliferation;first ubiquitous platform;fixed computing platform;utility companies;security vulnerabilities;classification-based AMI energy-theft detection;state estimation-based energy-theft detection;game theory-based energy-theft detection","","85","9","","","15 Apr 2014","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Although encryption increases security, it also masks intrusions and attacks by blocking the access to packet contents and traffic features, therefore making data analysis unfeasible. In spite of the strong effect of encryption, its impact has been scarcely investigated in the field. In this paper we study how encryption affects flow feature spaces and machine learning-based attack detection. We propose a new cross-layer feature vector that simultaneously represents traffic at three different levels: application, conversation, and endpoint behavior. We analyze its behavior under TLS and IPSec encryption and evaluate the efficacy with recent network traffic datasets and by using Random Forests classifiers. The cross-layer multi-key approach shows excellent attack detection in spite of TLS encryption. When IPsec is applied, the reduced variant obtains satisfactory detection for botnets, yet considerable performance drops for other types of attacks. The high complexity of network traffic is unfeasible for monolithic data analysis solutions, therefore requiring cross-layer analysis for which the multi-key vector becomes a powerful profiling core.","","978-1-7281-8206-3","10.1109/DSAA49011.2020.00061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9260017","Network Data Analysis;Encrypted Communications;Anomaly Detection;Machine Learning.","Encryption;Feature extraction;Protocols;Routing protocols;IP networks;Deep learning;Anomaly detection","computer network security;cryptography;Internet;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic","cross-layer multikey approach;attack detection;TLS encryption;reduced variant obtains satisfactory detection;monolithic data analysis solutions;multikey vector;cross-layer profiling;encrypted network data;anomaly detection;January 2017 encrypted Internet traffic;masks intrusions;packet contents;traffic features;data analysis;flow feature spaces;machine learning-based attack detection;cross-layer feature vector;endpoint behavior;network traffic datasets;random forests classifiers;IPSec encryption","","","","42","","20 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, efficient algorithms for detection of events of interest and their classification are of the utmost importance. Classical machine learning algorithms are problematic as they require hand-crafted features to be extracted and their adaptation to other sites or other DAS systems is difficult. In contrast, artificial neural networks (ANN) learn by themselves how to extract relevant features and signatures in the training phase. The training phase, however, necessitates the generation of a large database of tagged events (train-set). In this paper, we describe a new method for generating train-sets for DAS ANNs and its experimental testing. The method is based on the generative adversarial net (GAN) methodology. The use of a GAN facilitated an efficient generation of train-sets from a computer simulation of the DAS system. The train-set was then used to train an ANN, which processed experimental data from 5- and 20-km sensing fibers. Significant improvement in performance was obtained with respect to ANN trained by only simulation data or experimental data.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2019.2919713","ERC-StG(grant numbers:757497); Shlomo Shmeltzer Institute for Smart Transportation; Nvidia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8725535","Optical fiber sensors;distributed acoustic sensing;machine learning;neural networks;seismic measurements","Rayleigh channels;Spatial resolution;Signal to noise ratio;Phase measurement;Optical sensors","fibre optic sensors;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optical computing","train-set;ANN;simulation data;deep learning approach;automatic processing;fiber-optic distributed acoustic sensing data;classical machine learning algorithms;hand-crafted features;DAS system;artificial neural networks;training phase;tagged events;DAS ANNs;generative adversarial net methodology;sensing fibers","","4","","42","IEEE","29 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the open communication network for sensitive medical data transfer is giving rise to vulnerabilities and security concerns. To prevent adversarial manipulation of sensor measurements, SDHS IoMT controllers leverage anomaly detection systems on top of the disease classification systems. Machine learning (ML) is one of the most effective techniques for providing experience-based automated decision-making models. These models generalize well to produce the expected output for the unseen inputs from the learned patterns. Therefore, ML-based models are currently being adopted to automate the anomaly detection and disease classification tasks of SDHS. In this work, we consider a SDHS that uses supervised ML models for patient status/disease classification and unsupervised ML models for anomaly detection. However, the performance of the ML models largely depends on hyper-parameter tuning. Finding the optimal hyper-parameter is a challenging task, and it becomes more difficult and time-consuming in high-dimensional feature space. In this work, we propose BIOCAD, a comprehensive bio-inspired optimization framework for SDHS data classification and anomaly detection. The framework leverages a novel fitness function for unsu-pervised anomaly detection ML models.
