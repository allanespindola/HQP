Hence designing a cyber-resilient approach is of paramount importance. Traditional security methods are not adequate to prevent data breaches in case of cyberattacks. Cybercriminals have learned how to use new techniques and robust tools to hack, attack, and breach data. Fortunately, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have been introduced into cyberspace to construct smart models for defending systems from attacks. Since AI technologies can rapidly evolve to address complex situations, they can be used as fundamental tools in the field of cybersecurity. Al-based techniques can provide efficient and powerful cyber defense tools to recognize malware attacks, network intrusions, phishing and spam emails, and data breaches, to name a few, and to alert security incidents when they occur. In this paper, we review the impact of AI in cybersecurity and summarize existing research in terms of benefits of AI in cybersecurity.","","978-1-7281-7624-6","10.1109/CSCI51800.2020.00026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9458190","component: cybersecurity;artificial intelligence;machine learning;deep learning;bio-inspired computing;cognitive science","Scientific computing;Phishing;Unsolicited e-mail;Supervised learning;Cyberspace;Reinforcement learning;Tools","artificial intelligence;computer crime;invasive software;unsolicited e-mail","cyber defense tools;malware attacks;phishing;spam emails;data breaches;security incidents;cybersecurity;cybercriminals;artificial intelligence;smart models;AI technologies;network intrusions;cyberattacks","","","","41","","23 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is a consequence of long life cycles of their legacy devices which were initially designed without considering security and IoT connectivity, but they are now becoming more connected and integrated with emerging IoT technologies and messaging communication protocols. Deploying today's methodologies and solutions in brownfield IIoT systems is not viable, as security solutions must co-exist and fit these systems' requirements. This necessitates a realistic standardized IIoT testbed that can be used as an optimal format to measure the credibility of security solutions of IIoT networks, analyze IIoT attack landscapes and extract threat intelligence. Developing a testbed for brownfield IIoT systems is considered a significant challenge as these systems are comprised of legacy, heterogeneous devices, communication layers and applications that need to be implemented holistically to achieve high fidelity. In this article, we propose a new generic end-to-end IIoT security testbed, with a particular focus on the brownfield system and provide details of the testbed's architectural design and the implementation process. The proposed testbed can be easily reproduced and reconfigured to support the testing activities of new processes and various security scenarios. The proposed testbed operation is demonstrated on different connected devices, communication protocols and applications. The experiments demonstrate that this testbed is effective in terms of its operation and security testing. A comparison with existing testbeds, including a table of features is provided.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3032093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9233425","Brownfield;Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);security testing;testbed","Security;Testing;Protocols;Sensors;Resilience","computer network security;Internet of Things;protocols","brownfield IIoT systems;IoT connectivity;messaging communication protocols;realistic standardized IIoT testbed;IIoT networks;IIoT attack landscapes;generic end-to-end IIoT security testbed;industrial Internet of Things;legacy devices;IoT technologies;threat intelligence extraction;heterogeneous devices;communication layers;testbed architectural design;communication protocols;security testing","","1","","50","IEEE","20 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mitigation techniques against such attacks are not very effective for two reasons: 1) Most mitigation techniques protect against a specific vulnerability and do not take a system-wide approach, and 2) they either completely remove or greatly reduce the performance benefits of resource sharing. In this work, we argue in favor of detection-based protection, which would help apply mitigation only after successful detection of the attack at runtime. As such, detection would serve as the first line of defense against such attacks. However, for a detection based protection strategy to be effective, detection needs to be highly accurate, to incur minimum system overhead at runtime, should cover a large set of attacks and be capable of early stage detection, i.e., at the very least before the attack is completed. We propose a machine learning based side-channel attack (SCA) detection tool, called WHISPER that satisfies the above mentioned design constraints. WHISPER uses multiple machine learning models in an Ensemble fashion to detect SCAs at runtime using behavioral data of concurrent processes, that are collected through hardware performance counters (HPCs). Through extensive experiments with different variants of state-of-the-art attacks, we demonstrate that the proposed tool is capable of detecting a large set of known attacks that target both computational and storage parts in computing systems. We present experimental evaluation of WHISPER against Flush+Reload, Flush+Flush, Prime+Probe, Spectre and Meltdown attacks. The results are provided under variable system load conditions and stringent evaluation metrics comprising detection accuracy, speed, system-wide performance overhead and distribution of error (i.e., False Positives & False Negatives).

Compared with the traditional PDR architecture, the architecture adds security threat prediction, strengthens behavior-based detection, and further explains the concept of dynamic defense, so that it can adapt to changes in the grid IT infrastructure and business application systems. A unified security strategy can be formed to deal with more secretive and professional advanced attacks in the future. The architecture emphasizes that network security is a cyclical confrontation process. Enterprise network security thinking should change from the past “emergency response” to “continuous response”, real-time dynamic analysis of security threats, and automatically adapt to changing networks and threat environments, and Constantly optimize its own security defense mechanism, thus effectively solving the problem of the comprehensive technology transformation and upgrading of the security technology system from the traditional passive defense to the active sensing, from the simple defense to the active confrontation, and from the independent protection to the intelligence-driven.

The game tasks players with managing the security of a cyber-physical environment while facing various threats. Analysis of 12 groups of players (4 groups in each of our demographics) reveals strategies that repeat in particular demographics, e.g., managers and security experts generally favoring technological solutions over personnel training, which computer scientists preferred. Surprisingly, security experts were not ipso facto better players-in some cases, they made very questionable decisions-yet they showed a higher level of confidence in themselves. We classified players' decision-making processes, i.e., procedure-, experience-, scenario- or intuition-driven. We identified decision patterns, both good practices and typical errors and pitfalls.

These changes, called concept drifts, cause the performance of the learned model to degrade over time. As such it is essential to detect and adapt to changes in the data, for the model to be of any real use. While, model adaptation requires labeled data (for retraining), the detection process does not have to. Labeling data is time consuming and expensive, and if data changes are infrequent, most of the labeling effort, spent on verification, is wasted. In this paper, an ensemble based detection method is proposed, which tracks the number of samples in the critical disagreement regions of the ensemble, to detect concept drift from unlabeled data. The proposed algorithm, is-distribution and model independent, unsupervised and can be used in an online incremental fashion. Experimental analysis on 4 real world concept drift datasets shows that the proposed methodology gives high prediction performance, low false alarm rate and uses only 11.3% overall labeling, on average.","","978-1-5090-3207-5","10.1109/IRI.2016.26","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7785735","Streaming data;Unlabeled;Concept drift;Cybersecurity;Ensemble classification;Change detection","Monitoring;Labeling;Training;Adaptation models;Computer security;Robustness;Data models","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","classification blindspots;machine learning models;unlabeled data;ensemble based detection method;online incremental fashion","","1","","29","","19 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Trust boundaries separate IIoT processes and data stores in different groups based on user access privilege. Points where dataflow intersects with the trust boundary are becoming entry points for attackers. Attackers use various model skewing and intelligent techniques to generate adversarial/noisy examples that are indistinguishable from natural data. Many of the existing machine-learning (ML)-based approaches attempt to circumvent this problem. However, owing to an extremely large attack surface in the IIoT network, capturing a true distribution during training is difficult. The standard generative adversarial network (GAN) commonly generates adversarial examples for training using randomly sampled noise. However, the distribution of noisy inputs of GAN largely differs from actual distribution of data in IIoT networks and shows less robustness against adversarial attacks. Therefore, in this article, we propose a downsampler-encoder-based cooperative data generator that is trained using an algorithm to ensure better capture of the actual distribution of attack models for the large IIoT attack surface. The proposed downsampler-based data generator is alternatively updated and verified during training using a deep neural network discriminator to ensure robustness. This guarantees the performance of the generator against input sets with a high noise level at time of training and testing. Various experiments are conducted on a real IIoT testbed data set.

For these reasons, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of unsupervised and hybrid methods for intrusion detection, discussing their potential in the domain.

Since there is such a large volume of network data and attacks are minimal, machine learning approaches have focused on improving accuracy and reducing false positives, but this has frequently resulted in overfitting. In addition, the volume of intrusion detection alerts is large and creates fatigue in the human analyst who must review them. This research addresses the problems associated with event-level intrusion detection and the large volumes of intrusion alerts by applying active learning and cyber situation awareness. This paper includes the results of two experiments using the UNSWNB15 dataset. The first experiment evaluated sampling approaches for querying the oracle, as part of active learning.

In the main, organisations employ reactive approaches for cyber security, focused on rectifying immediate incidents and preventing repeat attacks, through protections such as vulnerability assessment and penetration testing (VAPT) security information and event management (SIEM), firewalls, anti-spam/anti-malware solutions and system patches. Such system have weaknesses in addressing modern modern stealthy attacks. Proactive approaches, have been seen as part of the solution to this problem. However, approaches such as VAPT have limited scope and only works with threats that have already been discovered. Promising methods such as threat hunting are gaining momentum, enabling organisations to identify and rapidly respond to any potential attacks, though they have been criticised for their significant cost. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid model for uncovering tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) through offensive security, specifically threat hunting via adversary emulation. The proposed technique is based on a novel approach of inducing adversary emulation (mapping each respective phase) model inside the threat hunting approach. The experimental results show that the proposed approach uses threat hunting via adversary emulation and has countervailing effects on hunting advance level threats. Moreover, the threat detection ability of the proposed approach utilizes minimum resources. The proposed approach can be used to develop the offensive security-aware environment for organizations to uncover advanced attack mechanisms and test their ability for attack detection.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3104260","Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Research - University of Warwick(grant numbers:EP/R007195/1); The Alan Turing Institute(grant numbers:EP/N510129/1); PETRAS National Centre of Excellence for IoT Systems Cybersecurity(grant numbers:EP/S035362/1); Higher Education Commission, Pakistan, Technology Development Initiative from Cyber Security Lab COMSATS University Islamabad(grant numbers:TDF-206); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9511495","Offensive security;threat hunting;proactive defense;red teaming;adversary emulation;mitre ATT&CK;threat analysis","Security;Emulation;Organizations;Penetration testing;Weapons;Tools;Testing","computer network security;firewalls;invasive software;unsolicited e-mail","critical data;advanced stealthy methods;legitimate tools;cyber security;vulnerability assessment and penetration testing;VAPT;stealthy attacks;proactive approach;potential attacks;threat hunting;advance level threats;threat detection;offensive security-aware environment;advanced attack mechanisms;attack detection;adversary emulation model;repeat attack prevention;proactive threat hunting;firewalls;antispam solution;antimalware solution;security information and event management","","1","","40","CCBY","11 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we focus on detecting the physical attacks against iBeacon transmitters- iBeacon transmitters can be stolen, tampered, faked and reused, which interfere with the legitimate iBeacon transmission, reduce the quality of service and ultimately degrade the user experience. We develop a detection system based on Hidden Markov Model running on the server-side to detect the misbehaving iBeacon transmitters without more energy consuming. Our system achieves 85% detection accuracy on average for all physical attack actions; meanwhile it has a 5% false alarm rate for non-attack situations in our designated trace experiments, and 100% correct binary judgements in the random-trace experiments.

They allow determining if a flow is malicious or not already before it is over, making it possible to take action immediately. However, considering the large number of packets that has to be inspected, for example in cloud/fog and edge computing, the question of computational efficiency arises. We show that by using a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach called SparseIDS, we can reduce the number of consumed packets by more than three fourths while keeping classification accuracy high. To minimize the computational expenses of the RL-based sampling we show that a shared neural network can be used for both the classifier and the RL logic. Thus, no additional resources are consumed by the sampling in deployment. Comparing to various other sampling techniques, SparseIDS consistently achieves higher classification accuracy by learning to sample only relevant packets. A major novelty of our RL-based approach is that it can not only skip up to a predefined maximum number of samples like other approaches proposed in the domain of Natural Language Processing but can even skip arbitrarily many packets in one step. This enables saving even more computational resources for long sequences. Inspecting SparseIDS's behavior of choosing packets shows that it adopts different sampling strategies for different attack types and network flows. Finally we build an automatic steering mechanism that can guide SparseIDS in deployment to achieve a desired level of sparsity.","","978-1-7281-4760-4","10.1109/CNS48642.2020.9162253","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9162253","","Neural networks;Protocols;Measurement;Conferences;Learning (artificial intelligence);Intrusion detection","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;recurrent neural nets;security of data","intrusion detection systems;network data;edge computing;reinforcement learning;RL-based sampling;RL logic;sampling techniques;network flows;packet sampling;recurrent neural networks;SparseIDS;classifier;classification accuracy","","1","","19","","7 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To this end, we characterize the runtime behaviors of microservices using eBPF-based lightweight system call tracing. To accurately fingerprint a diverse set of microservices based on their system call activities, we utilize the machine learning approach which combines Bayesian learning and LSTM autoencoders.

Applications and services previously running on private data centers are now being migrated to private or public clouds. Since most of the ASPs and enterprises have globally distributed user bases, their services need to be distributed across multiple clouds, spread across the globe which can achieve better performance in terms of latency, scalability and load balancing. The shift has eventually led the research community to study multi-cloud environments. However, the widespread acceptance of such environments has been hampered by major security concerns. Firewalls and traditional rule-based security protection techniques are not sufficient to protect user-data in multi-cloud scenarios. Recently, advances in machine learning techniques have attracted the attention of the research community to build intrusion detection systems (IDS) that can detect anomalies in the network traffic. Most of the research works, however, do not differentiate among different types of attacks. This is, in fact, necessary for appropriate countermeasures and defense against attacks. In this paper, we investigate both detecting and categorizing anomalies rather than just detecting, which is a common trend in the contemporary research works. We have used a popular publicly available dataset to build and test learning models for both detection and categorization of different attacks. To be precise, we have used two supervised machine learning techniques, namely linear regression (LR) and random forest (RF). We show that even if detection is perfect, categorization can be less accurate due to similarities between attacks. Our results demonstrate more than 99% detection accuracy and categorization accuracy of 93.6%, with the inability to categorize some attacks. Further, we argue that such categorization can be applied to multi-cloud environments using the same machine learning techniques.","","978-1-5090-6644-5","10.1109/CSCloud.2017.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7987183","anomaly;categorization;random forest;supervised machine learning;UNSW dataset;multi-cloud","Feature extraction;Cloud computing;Radio frequency;Firewalls (computing);Complexity theory;Training","cloud computing;data protection;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis","machine learning;anomaly detection;anomaly categorization;multicloud environments;cloud computing;application service providers;ASPs;capital expenditures;CAPEX;operational expenditures;OPEX;private data centers;public clouds;private clouds;load balancing;firewalls;rule-based security protection techniques;user-data protection;intrusion detection systems;IDS;network traffic;test learning models;linear regression;random forest","","16","","34","","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While some existing schemes (e.g., intrusion detection/protection) are effective for selective attacks, the evolving application layer DDoS attacks are often able to bypass them. We address this problem by proposing and validating a novel and efficient methodology, termed SENTRY, that specifically aims to mitigate application-layer DDoS attacks.

Such adversarial alteration of physical configuration could also be invoked through cyber security attacks against the camera's software vulnerabilities to administratively change the camera's physical configuration settings. When such Cyber Physical attacks occur, they affect the integrity of the targeted cameras that would in turn render these cameras ineffective in fulfilling the intended security functions.

The CLAM model uses one-dimensional convolution (Conv1D) to extract the abstract features of the signal values at each time step and feeds it into the Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) to extract the time dependence. By combining the attention mechanisms, we calculate the weight of each hidden state output by Bi-LSTM and perform a weighted summation, so that the model focuses only on locally important time steps, which can improve the convergence speed of the model and prediction accuracy. The proposed model uses the bit flip rate to extract continuous signal boundaries in the 64-bit CAN data, so it does not need to parse the CAN communication matrix and is suitable for different vehicles. The extensive evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed CLAM model can effectively detect CAN attacks, with an average F1-score of 0.951 and an error rate of 2.16%. Compared with the work in related research fields, the accuracy of attack detection is improved by 2.5%.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2021.3106940","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1736203,61802146); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9521818","CAN;anomaly detection;attention mechanism;CNN-LSTM","Anomaly detection;Hidden Markov models;Data models;Security;Payloads;Logic gates;Protocols","","","","","","28","IEEE","24 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This reconnaissance is typically accomplished through port scanning. Defense systems monitor for these unsolicited packets and raise an alarm if a predefined threshold is exceeded. To remain undetected, adversaries can either slow down the scan, and/or distribute it over multiple hosts. With each source below the threshold, the combination of all may still complete the scan efficiently. It is especially this group that is of concern: with enough resources and knowledge to execute such a coordinated activity, they will pose a more potent threat than the noisy ""script kiddie"". Correlating which out of 4 billion IPs potentially collaborate is however a challenging task, hence today's systems do not consider coordination beyond basic subnet aggregation.In this paper, we propose a method to identify and fingerprint distributed scanners based on commonalities in header fields, which are an artifact of the way fast port scanning software is built. We demonstrate that this method can effectively locate groups, and based on the monitoring logs we report on a number of new groups and tools, which have previously not been reported in the academic literature.Fingerprints generated can ultimately be used as Indicators of Compromise to detect and mitigate scanning behavior in order to deny adversaries the possibility to learn about weaknesses of a system.","2374-9709","978-1-7281-4973-8","10.1109/NOMS47738.2020.9110444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9110444","","","alarm systems;security of data;system monitoring","scanning behavior;defense systems monitor;unsolicited packets;alarm;coordinated activity;noisy script kiddie;basic subnet aggregation;fingerprint distributed scanners;header field patterns;port scanning software","","1","","18","","8 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike the program bytecode whose vulnerabilities and threats have been widely-discussed, whether and how the deep learning models deployed in the applications can be compromised are not well-understood since Neural Networks are usually viewed as a black box. In this paper, we introduce a highly practical backdoor attack achieved with a set of reverse-engineering techniques over compiled deep learning models. The core of the attack is a neural conditional branch constructed with a trigger detector and several operators and injected into the victim model as a malicious payload. The attack is effective as the conditional logic can be flexibly customized by the attacker, and scalable as it does not require any prior knowledge from the original model. We evaluated the attack effectiveness using 5 state-of-the-art deep learning models and real-world samples collected from 30 users. The results demonstrated that the injected backdoor can be triggered with a success rate of 93.5%, while only brought less than 2ms latency overhead and no more than 1.4% accuracy decrease. We further conducted an empirical study on real-world mobile deep learning apps collected from Google Play. We found 54 apps that were vulnerable to our attack, including popular and security-critical ones.

Pairgram exploits the frequency information of lookahed pairs and build a model of normal behavior. As it is generally assumed that there is a skewed distribution of normal and abnormal sequences, more frequently occurring system call sequences are considered as normal and other way for less frequent sequences.

This paper attempts to investigate whether the perceived traffic refers to probing activities and which exact scanning technique is being employed to perform the probing. Further, this work strives to examine probing traffic dimensions to infer the `machinery' of the scan, whether the probing activity is generated from a software tool or from a worm/bot net and whether the probing is random or follows a certain predefined pattern. Motivated by recent cyber attacks that were facilitated through probing, limited cyber security intelligence related to the mentioned inferences and the lack of accuracy that is provided by scanning detection systems, this paper presents a new approach to fingerprint probing activity. The approach leverages a number of statistical techniques, probabilistic distribution methods and observations in an attempt to understand and analyze probing activities. To prevent evasion, the approach formulates this matter as a change point detection problem that yielded motivating results. Evaluations performed using 55 GB of real dark net traffic shows that the extracted inferences exhibit promising accuracy and can generate significant insights that could be used for mitigation purposes.","","978-0-7695-5008-4","10.1109/ARES.2013.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6657223","Probing;Scanning;Cyber Security Capability","Doped fiber amplifiers;Correlation;Computer crime;Educational institutions;Accuracy;Cyberspace","computer network security;invasive software;statistical distributions;telecommunication traffic","intrusion attempt;perceived traffic;probing traffic dimensions;software tool;botnet;cyber attacks;cyber security intelligence;scanning detection systems;fingerprint probing activity;statistical techniques;probabilistic distribution method;change point detection problem;darknet traffic;worm","","14","","47","","7 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present “Anomaly Detection through Explanations” or ADE, a multimodal monitoring architecture to reconcile critical discrepancies under uncertainty. ADE uses symbolic explanations as a debugging language, by examining underlying reasons for those decisions. Further, when decisions conflict, our method uses a synthesizer, along with a priority hierarchy, to process subsystem outputs along with their underlying reasons and transparently judges the conflicts.

Smart grids provide bi-directional communications for the purpose of efficient energy and load management. In addition, energy generation is adjusted based on the load feedback. However, due to the dependency on the cyber infrastructure for load monitoring and reporting, generation control is inherently vulnerable to attacks. Recent studies have shown that the possibility of data integrity attacks on the generation control can significantly disrupt the energy system. In this work, we present simple yet effective data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system for automatic generation control (AGC). The first tier is a short-term adaptive predictor for system variables, such as load and area control error (ACE). The first tier provides a real-time measurement predictor that adapts to the underlying changing behavior of these system variables, and flags out the abnormal behavior in these variables independently. The second tier provides deep state inspection to investigate the presence of anomalies by incorporating the overall system variable correlation using Markov models. Moreover, we expand our second tier inspection to include multi-AGC environment where a behavior of one AGC is validated against the behavior of the interconnected AGC. The combination of tier-1 light-weight prediction and tier-2 offline deep state inspection offers a great advantage to balance accuracy and real-time requirements of intrusion detection for AGC environment. Our results show high detection accuracy (95%) under different multi-attack scenarios. Second tier successfully verified all the injected intrusions.","","978-1-4799-5890-0","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997497","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997497","","Automatic generation control;Markov processes;Prediction algorithms;Smart grids;Mathematical model;Correlation;Intrusion detection","power engineering computing;power system control;security of data;smart power grids","automatic generation control;smart grid;legacy energy infrastructures;data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system;AGC;short-term adaptive predictor;area control error;ACE;Markov models","","8","8","20","","29 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even though in most cases these techniques are effective enough, this paper describes how instead they can be detected using properly configured IDSs. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach named polymorphic blending exfiltration that serves to avoid detection from signature-based as well as anomaly-based IDSs. This technique permits to blend the exfiltrated data in the normal and legitimate traffic. We show how IDSs can be easily improved in order to be able to detect such exfiltration.

A successful DoS attack on network resources reduces availability of service to a web site and backend resources, and could easily result in a loss of millions of dollars in revenue depending on company size. There are many DoS attack methods, each of which is critical to providing an understanding of the nature of the DoS attack class. There has been a rise in recent years of application-layer DoS attack methods that target web servers and are challenging to detect. An attack may be disguised to look like legitimate traffic, except it targets specific application packets or functions. Slow Read DoS attack is one type of slow HTTP attack targeting the application-layer. Slow Read attacks are often used to exploit weaknesses in the HTTP protocol, as it is the most widely used protocol on the Internet. In this paper, we use Full Packet Capture (FPC) datasets for detecting Slow Read DoS attacks with machine learning methods. All data collected originates in a live network environment. Our approach produces FPC features taken from network packets at the IP and TCP layers. Experimental results show that the machine learners were quite successful in identifying the Slow Read attacks with high detection and low false alarm rates using FPC data. Our experiment evaluates FPC datasets to determine the accuracy and efficiency of several detection models for Slow Read attacks. The experiment demonstrates that FPC features are discriminative enough to detect such attacks.","","978-1-7281-1054-7","10.1109/IRI49571.2020.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9191389","Application Layer DDoS Attacks;Slow Read;DDoS Detection;Machine Learning;Intrusion Detection;Full Packet Captures;Feature Selection","Protocols;Computer crime;Tools;Web servers;Open systems","computer crime;computer network security;hypermedia;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);transport protocols","detection methods;Web servers;Web site;backend resources;DoS attack class;application-layer DoS attack;specific application packets;Slow Read DoS attack;Full Packet Capture datasets;denial of service attacks;FPC datasets;TCP layers;IP layers;HTTP attack;cyber criminals;organized crime groups;machine learning methods","","","","27","","10 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With this approach, all parameters of the radial basis functions (along with the network weights) are learned end-to-end by gradient descent without external optimization. We further explore how additional dense hidden-layers, and the number of radial basis kernels influence the results. This novel approach is applied to five prominent intrusion detection datasets (NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, AWID, CICIDS2017 and CICDDOS2019) achieving better performance metrics than alternative state-of-the-art models.

However, existing device identifier used by IDS (e.g. IP and MAC) can be forged easily. In order to address this problem, we propose a fingerprinting method (Spatial-Temporal Feature Fingerprint, STFF) enabling identification of machine tools. The fingerprint is a vector composed of spatial and temporal features extracted from payload grayscale image, which is constructed with all payloads in a polling period. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network are used to extract spatial and temporal features from payload grayscale image respectively. Finally, a real-world unencrypted data set with two vendors (three models for each) of machine tools is used to verify the performance of the fingerprinting method. Our evaluation experiments show that the STFF could be a unique identifier to describe the communication relationship between machine tools and MDC server.","","978-1-7281-7649-9","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS50907.2020.00044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9407864","Spatial-Temporal Feature;Machine tools;Fingerprint;Artificial Neural Network","Production;Fingerprint recognition;Gray-scale;Feature extraction;Machine tools;Safety;Servers","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;fingerprint identification;machine tools;production engineering computing;recurrent neural nets;security of data","Distributed Numerical Control system;Machine Data Collection server;production logic;Intrusion Detection System;Spatial-Temporal Feature Fingerprint;DNC networks;Spatial-Temporal features;fingerprinting method;machine tools;payload grayscale image;spatial features;Long Short-Term Memory network","","","","21","","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, it is not uncommon to observe a significant degree of class imbalance with only a few instances for minority classes in many datasets, including network traffic traces highly skewed toward a large number of normal connections while very small in quantity for attack instances. A well-known approach to addressing the class imbalance problem is data augmentation that generates synthetic instances belonging to minority classes. However, traditional statistical techniques may be limited since the extended data through statistical sampling should have the same density as original data instances with a minor degree of variation. This paper takes a learning-based approach to data augmentation to enable effective network anomaly detection. One of the critical challenges for the learning-based approach is the mode collapse problem resulting in a limited diversity of samples, which was also observed from our preliminary experimental result. To this end, we present a novel ""Divide-Augment-Combine"" (DAC) strategy, which groups the instances based on their characteristics and augments data on a group basis to represent a subset independently using a generative adversarial model.

However, due to the characteristics of ICSs, the risk assessment for IT systems is not completely applicable for ICSs. In this paper, through the consideration of the characteristics of ICSs, a targeted multilevel Bayesian network containing attack, function, and incident models is proposed. Following this proposal, a novel multimodel-based hazardous incident prediction approach is designed. On this basis, a dynamic cybersecurity risk assessment approach, which has the ability to assess the risk caused by unknown attacks, is also devised. Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of the risk assessment, which may be reduced by the redundant accumulation of overlaps amongst different consequences, a unified consequence quantification method is presented. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a simulation of a simplified chemical reactor control system is conducted in MATLAB. The simulation results can clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach has the ability to dynamically calculate the cybersecurity risk of ICSs in a timely manner.

However, many ML algorithms presume that training and testing data follow the same or similar data distributions, which may not hold in the dynamic time-varying systems like the smart grid. As operating points may change dramatically over time, the resulting data distribution shifts could lead to degraded detection performance and delayed incidence responses. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a semi-supervised framework based on domain-adversarial training to transfer the knowledge of known attack incidences to detect returning threats at different hours and load patterns. Using normal operation data of the ISO New England grids, the proposed framework leverages adversarial training to adapt learned models against new attacks launched at different times of the day. Effectiveness of the proposed detection framework is evaluated against the well-studied false data injection attacks synthesized on the IEEE 30-bus system, and the results demonstrated the superiority of the framework against persistent threats recurring in the highly dynamic smart grid.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-6926-2","10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9207525","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9207525","Adversarial training;false data injection;intrusion detection;smart grid security;transfer learning;domain adaptation","Feature extraction;Training;Smart grids;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Testing","learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;smart power grids;time-varying systems","IEEE 30-bus system;dynamic smart grid;ISO New England grids;normal operation data;dynamic time-varying systems;data distributions;ML algorithms;smart grid security monitoring;machine learning;cyber-physical threats;semisupervised domain-adversarial training;false data injection attacks;intrusion detection","","","","39","","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a domain adversarial defense (DAD) system to reduce the domain mismatch and generalize the model to handle real-time attacks in cloud. Two novel strategies are applied into our proposed DAD system. 1) Latent feature extractor to extract domain invariant features across multiple domains. 2) Adversarial training algorithm to perform unsupervised adaptation over a defense system using real-time attack samples. The capability of the DAD model is empirically substantiated across four datasets to understand its effectiveness across both known and unknown attacks. The experimental analysis shows that the proposed DAD model achieves substantial improvements with minimum overhead, reduced latency and better efficacy over existing defense mechanisms.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2021.3097903","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9488307","Cloud Computing;DDoS;Fog computing;Deep Learning;Adversarial Training;Latent features.","Feature extraction;Denial-of-service attack;Computer crime;Training;Real-time systems;Deep learning;Support vector machines","","","","","","","IEEE","16 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

For some sectors, like industry, smart grids, transportation, and medical services, the significance of such attacks is obvious, since IoT technologies are part of critical back-end systems. However, in sectors where IoT is usually at the end-user side, like smart homes, such attacks can be underestimated, since not all possible attack paths are examined. In this paper, we survey IoT-enabled cyber attacks, found in all application domains since 2010. For each sector, we emphasize on the latest, verified IoT-enabled attacks, based on known real-world incidents and published proof-of-concept attacks. We methodologically analyze representative attacks that demonstrate direct, indirect, and subliminal attack paths against critical targets. Our goal is threefold: 1) to assess IoT-enabled cyber attacks in a risk-like approach, in order to demonstrate their current threat landscape; 2) to identify hidden and subliminal IoT-enabled attack paths against critical infrastructures and services; and 3) to examine mitigation strategies for all application domains.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2018.2855563","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8410404","Internet of Things;cyber attacks;smart grids;SCADA;intelligent transportation systems;smart medical systems;smart home;critical infrastructures","SCADA;Cyberattack;Internet of Things;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Critical infrastructure;Smart grids;Smart homes","critical infrastructures;Internet of Things;security of data","IoT technologies;IoT-enabled cyberattacks;services;critical infrastructures;proof-of-concept attacks;critical back-end systems","","57","","262","IEEE","12 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Engine Control Module (ECM) is generally recognized as one of the most essential components owing to its functionality of regulating air and fuel input to the engine. Consequently, automotive security is an emerging problem that will only escalate as vehicles integrate more computerized components in conjunction with wireless system connectivity. Attackers that successfully gain access to important vehicular components and compromise existing functionality can induce a plethora of malevolent activities. With the evolution and exponential proliferation of Malware, identifying malicious entities is critical for maintaining proper system performance. Traditional anti-virus software is inadequate against complex Malware, which has engendered a push towards Hardware-assisted Malware Detection (HMDs) using Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs). HPCs are special purpose registers that track low-level micro-architectural events.

In this paper, we have explored the use of Residual Attention for malware detection and have compared this with the existing CNN based methods and conventional Machine Learning algorithms using GIST features. The proposed method could efficiently focus the 'attention' to precisely those sections of the malware which were significant in being distinguished from benign files, thus reducing the False Positives which is primary from the Accessibility point of view in Cyber Security.

Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been widely used for botnet detection with flow-based features. The prime challenges with flow-based features are that they have high computational overhead and do not fully capture network communication patterns. Recently, graph-based ML has witnessed a dramatic increase in attention. In communication networks, graph data offers insights information about communication patterns between hosts. In this paper, we propose a graph-based ML model for botnet detection that first considers the significance of graph features before developing a generalized model for detecting botnets based on the selected important features. We explore different feature sets selected using five filter-based feature evaluation measures derived from various theories such as consistency, correlation, and information. Two heterogeneous botnet datasets, CTU-13 and IoT-23, were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed graph-based botnet detection with several supervised ML algorithms. Experiment results show that using features reduces training time and model complexity and provides high bots detection rate. Our proposed detection model detects different types of botnet families and exhibits robustness to zero-day attacks. Compared to state-of-the-art techniques flow-, and graph-based, our approach achieves higher precision and shows competitive accuracy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3094183","Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah(grant numbers:D-285-611-1442); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9471889","Botnet detection;cybersecurity;feature selection;machine learning","Botnet;Feature extraction;Payloads;Malware;Training;Monitoring;Protocols","","","","","","65","CCBY","2 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In networking within IoT, spectrum scarcity requires the consideration of the adaptive cognitive radio (CR) technology to achieve interference-free and on-demand IoT solutions for a number of applications. However, CR networks share the same security weaknesses of legacy wireless networks. Jamming is considered a common attack, where jammers can attack networks in a proactive or reactive approach. In this paper, we study the channel assignment problem under both proactive and reactive jamming attacks. Specifically, we propose a novel probabilistic-based channel assignment mechanism that aims at minimizing the invalidity ratio of CR packet transmissions subject to delay constraints. The proposed scheme exploits the statistical information of licensed primary users activities, fading conditions and jamming attacks over idle channels to provide communicating CR IoT devices with the most secured channels of lowest invalidity ratios.

The challenge of anomaly detection lies in how to distinguish the diverse or even unknown anomalies. Therefore, previous studies have focused on imagelevel anomaly detection tasks, and mostly based on unsupervised methods. These methods only consider the characteristics of normal samples and are confined to the “normal” category, ignoring information between samples. In particular, the limitations of unsupervised methods are more obvious for pixellevel abnormalities such as the chromosomal structural anomalies investigated in this paper, because the similarity between normal and abnormal samples is relatively high. In this work, we propose a supervised anomaly detection approach Classification - Enhanced GANomaly (abbreviated as CS-GANomaly). By fusing the category information with the sample, the spatial distribution of the sample has regional characteristics and then combining the anomaly detection strategies to carry out multidimension anomaly detection. The CS-GANomaly adopts the GAN framework for adversarial training and adapts the GAN output to anomaly detection. The experimental results prove the superiority of our approach, whether it is a pixel-level anomaly in abnormal chromosome dataset or image-level anomaly in the benchmark dataset.","","978-1-7281-7738-0","10.1109/IICSPI51290.2020.9332331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9332331","Anomaly detection;Generative adversarial network;Chromosome classification","Adaptation models;Graphical models;Generative adversarial networks;Task analysis;Gallium nitride;Anomaly detection;Biological cells","cellular biophysics;data mining;image classification;image fusion;object recognition;pattern classification;unsupervised learning","CS-GANomaly;ancillary classifier GANs;urgent task;diverse anomalies;even unknown anomalies;imagelevel anomaly detection tasks;unsupervised methods;normal samples;chromosomal structural anomalies;abnormal samples;supervised anomaly detection approach Classification;anomaly detection strategies;multidimension anomaly detection;pixel-level anomaly;abnormal chromosome dataset","","","","39","","1 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This shows that self-play, which has been applied in other domains with great success, can be effective in the context of network security. Inspection of the converged policies show that the emerged policies reflect common-sense knowledge and are similar to strategies of humans.

However, recent studies have shown that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples, and these manipulated instances can mislead DNN into making false predictions. The existing methods of generating adversarial examples include pixel-level perturbation or spatial transformation of images, which cannot consider concurrently with the semantic quality of adversarial examples or success rate of attack. These methods are computationally bulky and slow to generate the adversarial examples. To solve this kind of issue, a two-stage generative adversarial networks (TSGAN) with semantic content constraints is proposed in this paper. The first-stage uses the original example dataset to train generator G, which can help the generator learn the distribution of real examples. Then, the example semantic quality constraint loss function, the adversarial loss function and the distance loss function are adopted in the second-stage, so that the generator G can continue to learn to search the distribution of the adversarial examples, and train the new generator G<sub>adv</sub>. The adversarial examples generated by generator G<sub>adv</sub> are better fit the distribution of real examples, and have targeted black-box attack capability. The experiments show that the adversarial examples generated by TSGAN can achieve the success rate of attack at 98.40% in target model, 29.40% success rate in defense-oriented model. And 77.58% success rate is obtained in the transfer test attack. The results show that the adversarial examples generated by the proposed model, which has a highly attack success rate and more difficult to defense. Meanwhile, the improved adversarial examples have stronger transfer ability than the existing models. The proposed model can effectively reduce the expression of target category features of the adversarial examples, and the generated adversarial examples have better semantic quality than others.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3037329","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019QY2202); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1836108,U1936216,62002197,62001038); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9256206","Generative adversarial networks;adversarial example attack;semantic content","Training;Generators;Feature extraction;Semantics;Generative adversarial networks;Gallium nitride;Perturbation methods","image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data","two-stage generative adversarial networks;adversarial example generation;example semantic quality constraint loss function;semantic content constraints;deep neural networks;pixel-level perturbation;adversarial loss function;distance loss function","","","","36","CCBYNCND","11 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose two new models which incorporate these settings and, hence, are more realistic, and use adversarial risk analysis to find their solutions.

However, in a world of black hats, technology often has a dark side as well. Therefore, the VCC is limited by considerable security and privacy challenges. The special characteristics of VCC, including the multitenancy nature of clouds, intermittent wireless communications, high mobility of vehicles, and rapid resource elasticity with decentralized operations, have promoted security solutions used in vehicular ad hoc networks and conventional cloud computing to be revised. This paper first presents a state-of-the-art study of VCC that focuses on VCC architecture, its features analysis, and extensive VCC applications. Second, the proposed threats identification taxonomy and an exhaustive survey on security and privacy issues in VCC are presented under a layered approach: physical resource layer, vehicle-to-anything (V2X) network layer, and vehicular cloud layer, as well as at a complete system level.

In this paper, we introduce a domain-agonistic, end-to-end, ensemble-based deep active learning framework for anomaly detection. By leveraging unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection models, our framework does not rely on labeled data to start training. By using active learning, our framework incorporates human feedback in the workflow to reduce false positive rates, which is essential in many real-world applications. In addition, we use a neural network to ensemble various anomaly detectors for further performance improvement and leverage a reference score generator to enable an intuitive explanation of anomaly scores.

In this research, we use UGR'16 dataset to conduct data wrangling initially. This technique helps to prepare a test set from the original dataset to train the neural network model effectively. We experimented with a series of inputs of varying sizes (i.e. 10000, 50000, 1 million) to observe the performance of the MLP neural network model with distribution of features over accuracy. Later, we use Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model that produces samples of different attack labels (e.g. blacklist, anomaly spam, ssh scan) for balancing the dataset. These samples are generated based on data from the UGR'16 dataset. Further experiments with MLP neural network model shows that a balanced attack sample dataset, made possible with GAN, produces more accurate results than an imbalanced one.","","978-1-7281-1054-7","10.1109/IRI49571.2020.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9191678","Neural Network (NN);Imbalanced Dataset;Generative Adversarial Network (GAN);Adversarial Samples;Network security.","Gallium nitride;Generative adversarial networks;Data models;Neural networks;Generators;Intrusion detection;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;pattern classification;security of data","UGR16 dataset;MLP neural network;balanced attack sample dataset;imbalanced data problem;intrusion detection;machine learning;defense mechanisms;cyber attacks;multilayer perceptron;benign data;classification;attack labels;generative adversarial network;attack detection;data wrangling","","2","","29","","10 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This includes defensive systems that are able to learn from novel attacks and to detect 0-day vulnerabilities as early as possible. Honeypots are not defensive systems based on prevention, but they still represent an effective way to gather information about attacks from the source. Nevertheless, most existing solutions operate in a stateless way. As a consequence, they are easily identified by expert attackers, and they are unable to track progress of individual attacks in large applications. We propose a novel approach that enables a so called stateful honeypot. The idea comes from the observation that a typical cyber attack to a Critical Infrastructure is carried out through multiple attempts and intrusions. Hence the main goal is to fingerprint each attacker by observing and registering his adopted methods, tools and actions. Once identified, the adversary is redirected to his specific environment that preserves the history of his previous operations including the installation of rootkits or backdoors. The proposed solution paves the way to a more effective generation of honeypots that are necessary to face the augmented complexity of cyber attacks.","","978-1-7281-1360-9","10.1109/CSCI46756.2018.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8947682","Cyber Security;Critical Infrastructure Protection;honey pot;decoy system;traffic redirection","Critical infrastructure;Cyberattack;Computer architecture;Virtualization;Servers;Operating systems","authorisation","adversarial fingerprinting;cyber attacks;stateful honeypots;cyber defenses;critical infrastructure;0-day vulnerabilities;deception environments","","","","16","","2 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this survey, we analyze the recent advancements made in the development of MTDs and highlight (1) how these defenses can be defined using common terminology, (2) can be made more effective with the use of artificial intelligence techniques for decision making, (3) be implemented in practice and (4) evaluated. We first define an MTD using a simple and yet general notation that captures the key aspects of such defenses. We then categorize these defenses into different sub-classes depending on what they move, when they move and how they move. In trying to answer the latter question, we showcase the use of domain knowledge and game-theoretic modeling can help the defender come up with effective and efficient movement strategies. Second, to understand the practicality of these defense methods, we discuss how various MTDs have been implemented and find that networking technologies such as Software Defined Networking and Network Function Virtualization act as key enablers for implementing these dynamic defenses. We then briefly highlight MTD test-beds and case-studies to aid readers who want to examine or deploy existing MTD techniques. Third, our survey categorizes proposed MTDs based on the qualitative and quantitative metrics they utilize to evaluate their effectiveness in terms of security and performance. We use well-defined metrics such as risk analysis and performance costs for qualitative evaluation and metrics based on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA), attack representation, QoS impact, and targeted threat models for quantitative evaluation.
