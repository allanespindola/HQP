Several machine learning techniques have been developed to build network intrusion detection systems for correctly detecting unforeseen cyber-attacks at the network-level. For example, deep artificial neural network architectures have recently achieved state-of-the-art results. In this paper a novel deep neural network architecture is defined, in order to learn flexible and effective intrusion detection models, by combining an unsupervised stage for multi-channel feature learning with a supervised one exploiting feature dependencies on cross channels. The aim is to investigate whether class-specific features of the network flows could be learned and added to the original ones in order to increase the model accuracy. In particular, in the unsupervised stage, two autoencoders are separately learned on normal and attack flows, respectively. As the top layer in the decoder of these autoencoders reconstructs samples in the same space as the input one, they could be used to define two new feature vectors allowing the representation of each network flow as a multi-channel sample. In the supervised stage, a multi-channel parametric convolution is adopted, in order to learn the effect of each channel on the others. In particular, as the samples belong to two different distributions (normal and attack flows), the samples labelled as normal should be more similar to the representation reconstructed with the normal autoencoder than that of the attack one, and viceversa. This expected dependency will be exploited to better disentangle the differences between normal and attack flows. The proposed neural network architecture leads to better predictive accuracy when compared to competitive intrusion detection architectures on three benchmark datasets.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2980937","research project ???TALIsMan-Tecnologie di Assistenza personALizzata per il Miglioramento della quAlit?? della vitA???(grant numbers:ID: ARS01_01116,PON RI 2014-2020); Italian Ministry for Universities and Research (MIUR); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9036935","Cybersecurity;intrusion detection;machine learning;computer security","Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Deep learning;Neural networks;Computer architecture;Decoding","neural nets;security of data;unsupervised learning","competitive intrusion detection architectures;multichannel deep feature learning;network cybersecurity;machine learning techniques;network intrusion detection systems;unforeseen cyber-attacks;network-level;deep artificial neural network architectures;unsupervised stage;multichannel feature;cross channels;class-specific features;model accuracy;feature vectors;network flow;multichannel sample;supervised stage;multichannel parametric convolution;normal autoencoder;intrusion detection models","","5","","65","CCBY","16 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Services and applications that can benefit from MCS are various such as transportation, health care, public safety, smart mobility and many others. Distributed nature and lack of a pre-established trust mechanism in MCS systems make them vulnerable in the presence of various threats that can be initiated by either sensing data providers or service requesters. While it is relatively easier to detect and eliminate false sensing data submissions via outlier detection, tasks that are submitted to keep the MCS servers and participating devices occupied and clogged are challenging since these attacks can be planned intelligently. In this paper, we investigate the potential of adversarial machine learning to anticipate fake / illegitimate task submissions to MCS systems. To this end, we empower a threat anticipation mechanism that leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to inject adversarial samples of fake / illegitimate tasks to an MCS system. We evaluate the impact of GAN-driven attacks in terms of Adversarial Attack Success Rate (AASR) and Attack Severity (AS). Our numerical results show that the potential risk and severity of the offensive use of Machine Learning is significantly higher than an adversarial baseline that injects fake tasks solely based on random noise samples.","2642-6587","978-1-6654-3477-5","10.1109/SOSE52839.2021.00011","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9564359","Mobile-Crowdsensing;Adversarial-Machine-Learning;Security;Machine-Learning;Generative-Adversarial-Networks","Crowdsensing;Service-oriented systems engineering;Transportation;Distributed databases;Medical services;Generative adversarial networks;Sensors","","","","","","37","","15 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In fact, compared to other layers, the physical layer between the base stations and users' device presents increased opportunities for attacks such as eavesdropping and data fabrication.

However, emerging CPS fields suffer from imbalanced and missing sample data, which makes the training of IDS difficult. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) based intrusion detection system (G-IDS), where GAN generates synthetic samples, and IDS gets trained on them along with the original ones.

"Payload-based Anomaly Detection for Industrial Internet Using Encoder Assisted GAN","P. Zhou",Shanghai University,"2020 IEEE 6th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC)","12 Feb 2021","2020","","","669","673","Payload-based anomaly detection has been proved effective in discovering Internet misbehavior and potential intrusions, but highly relies on the unstructured feature engineering to generalize the distribution of normal payloads. This kind of generalization may not adapt well to the emerging industrial Internet, where the normal behaviors are more diverse and usually embedded in the raw payloads' local structures. In this paper, we tackle this generalization problem and propose a very different solution to payload-based anomaly detection without the need of feature engineering. Our basic idea is to learn the raw structures of normal payloads directly by a generative adversarial network (GAN), in which we have a generator (i.e., a reversed convolutional decoder) to sample raw payloads from a latent space as well as a discriminator (i.e., a convolutional classifier) to guide the generator produce raw payloads approximating the normal structures. We also deploy an assisted convolutional encoder to map the true payloads back to the latent space and combine with the GAN's decoder (i.e., generator) to reconstruct the payload structures. We consider anomalies appear in condition the re-constructed payloads are largely deviated from the true ones, since our encoder-decoder architecture is trained able to rebuild only the normal payload structures. We have evaluated our solution using extensive experiments on real-world industrial Internet datasets, and confirmed its effectiveness in detecting industrial Internet anomalies in the raw payloads.","","978-1-7281-8635-1","10.1109/ICCC51575.2020.9345104","Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai(grant numbers:18ZR1415000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9345104","Payload-based Anomaly Detection;Generative Adversarial Network (GAN);Convolutional Neural Network","Neural networks;Generative adversarial networks;Generators;Internet;Gallium nitride;Anomaly detection;Payloads","data privacy;Internet;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;production engineering computing;security of data","payload-based anomaly detection;real-world industrial Internet datasets;industrial Internet anomalies;encoder assisted GAN;normal payload distribution;Internet misbehavior;Internet intrusions;encoder assisted generative adversarial network","","","","25","","12 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed generative-adversarial based semi-supervised learning framework, named GBSS, is a triple network that aims to optimize a newly defined objective function to enhance the performance of the semi-supervised learner with the help of a generator and discriminator. The duel between the generator and discriminator results in the generation of more synthetic minority class samples that are very similar to the original minority samples (attacks and faults). Meanwhile, GBSS trains the semi-supervised model to learn the general distribution of the minority class samples including the newly generated samples in contrast to other classes and iteratively adjusts its weights. Moreover, a diagnostic framework is designed, in which GBSS and several state-of-the-art semi-supervised learners are used for learning and diagnosing attacks and faults in power grids. These methods are evaluated and compared for diagnosing attacks and faults in two different power grid cases.

This uncertainty makes an attack more difficult, as an attacker cannot be sure whether the system does contain deceptive elements or not.

However, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been recently found vulnerable to well-designed input samples called adversarial examples. Adversarial perturbations are imperceptible to human but can easily fool DNNs in the testing/deploying stage. The vulnerability to adversarial examples becomes one of the major risks for applying DNNs in safety-critical environments. Therefore, attacks and defenses on adversarial examples draw great attention.

Recently, the structure of 6G networks has tended to be extremely heterogeneous, densely deployed, and dynamic. Combined with tight quality of service (QoS), such complex architecture will result in the untenability of legacy network operation routines. In response, artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning (ML), is emerging as a fundamental solution to realize fully intelligent network orchestration and management. By learning from uncertain and dynamic environments, AI-/ML-enabled channel estimation and spectrum management will open up opportunities for bringing the excellent performance of ultrabroadband techniques, such as terahertz communications, into full play. Additionally, challenges brought by ultramassive access with respect to energy and security can be mitigated by applying AI-/ML-based approaches. Moreover, intelligent mobility management and resource allocation will guarantee the ultrareliability and low latency of services. Concerning these issues, this article introduces and surveys some state-of-the-art techniques based on AI/ML and their applications in 6G to support ultrabroadband, ultramassive access, and ultrareliable and lowlatency services.","1556-6080","","10.1109/MVT.2020.3019650","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971257); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019T120091; 2018M640130); The Verification Platform of Multi-tier Coverage Communication Network for Oceans(grant numbers:LZC0020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9206115","","6G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;Artificial intelligence;Channel estimation;Radio spectrum management;Neural networks","5G mobile communication;6G mobile communication;channel estimation;intelligent networks;IP networks;learning (artificial intelligence);mobility management (mobile radio);quality of service;resource allocation","resource allocation;intelligent mobility management;ultramassive access;fully intelligent network orchestration;artificial intelligence;legacy network operation routines;intelligent level;powerful level;ultrareliable lowlatency service;enhanced broadband;6G;demanding services;massive access;carrying forward enhanced bandwidth;wireless networks;machine learning","","10","","46","IEEE","25 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Sandbox based detection systems perform syntactic analysis of the binary files to find known patterns from the un-encrypted segment of the malware file. Anomaly based detection systems can detect polymorphic threats but generate enormous false alarms. In this work, authors present a novel cognitive framework using semantic features to detect the presence of polymorphic malware inside a Microsoft Windows host using a process tree based temporal directed graph.

Another novel feature of the proposed algorithm is to detect FDIAs without using any historical cyber-attack data, which are sketchy due to security constraints and infinitesimal in occurrence numbers. The proposed BP method utilizes local sensor measurement data to calculate local belief and send it as a message signal to the control center. Then, the control center determines final/global belief and compares the result with a predefined threshold value derived from the uncompromised measurement database. The real-time steady-state load data are utilized for dc state estimation.

We have long recognized that defending this space is complex, requiring information integration, and decisions of man and machine to coalesce in a dynamic environment full of shifting priorities. These properties suggest that, as in other domains with similar characteristics, situation awareness (SA) of a human cyber defender is paramount to the quality of decision outcomes in cyber defense. The majority of existing research in cyber situation awareness, centers on information systems and computers, which piece together disparate data. Fused data from multiple sources, for example, is necessary for cyberspace visualization efforts. The judgment for successful cyber SA from this perspective is different from one that is human-centered. In comparison, we rarely assess human cognitive awareness in cyberspace. In part, this reflects a need, based on prior theory, to first define critical elements of information that the human must perceive, work to elucidate how humans combine these elements to comprehend the state of the network, and how together, this awareness helps analysts predict the future state of the network. In other words, although data fusion can provide value by reducing the cognitive load created to piece together disparate sources of information, human awareness of the network (cyber-cognitive situation awareness - CCSA) is perhaps the ultimate intermediary for defense performance. Toward such an understanding, we discuss the results of a cognitive task analysis (CTA) which sought to determine the goals and abstracted elements of awareness that cyber analysts seek in network defense. We present the foundation for a series of planned experiments that establishes CCSA measurement, and baselines the efforts of cyber defenders. Once assessed, we can then begin to consider the help offered by fusion systems, automation of defensive capabilities, and cyber visualizations in a methodologically rigorous manner that has been lacking.","2379-1675","978-1-5090-0632-8","10.1109/COGSIMA.2016.7497780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7497780","cyber network defense;cyber-cognitive situation awareness;cyber situation awareness;decision-making;cognitive task analysis","Cyberspace;Interviews;Government;Data integration;Computers;Decision making","computer network security;data visualisation;sensor fusion","cyber-cognitive situation awareness characterization;CCSA;cyber defense analysis;information integration;dynamic environment;human cyber defender;cyber situation awareness;information systems;computers;cyberspace visualization;human cognitive awareness;network state comprehension;data fusion;cognitive load;defense performance;cognitive task analysis;CTA;network defense;defensive capability automation;cyber visualization","","18","","33","","23 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the growing pace at which new attacks are developed, conventional signature based attack detection methods are often not enough, and machine learning poses as a potential solution. Adversarial machine learning is a research area that examines both the generation and detection of adversarial examples, which are inputs specially crafted to deceive classifiers, and has been extensively studied specifically in the area of image recognition, where minor modifications are performed on images that cause a classifier to produce incorrect predictions. However, in other fields, such as intrusion and malware detection, the exploration of such methods is still growing. The aim of this survey is to explore works that apply adversarial machine learning concepts to intrusion and malware detection scenarios. We concluded that a wide variety of attacks were tested and proven effective in malware and intrusion detection, although their practicality was not tested in intrusion scenarios. Adversarial defenses were substantially less explored, although their effectiveness was also proven at resisting adversarial attacks. We also concluded that, contrarily to malware scenarios, the variety of datasets in intrusion scenarios is still very small, with the most used dataset being greatly outdated.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2974752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9001114","Cybersecurity;adversarial machine learning;intrusion detection;malware detection","Machine learning;Malware;Perturbation methods;Intrusion detection;Computer security;Computational modeling;Machine learning algorithms","invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence)","cyber-security;digital attacks;adversarial machine learning;classifier;image recognition;malware detection;adversarial defenses;intrusion detection;adversarial attacks;signature based attack detection methods","","8","","72","CCBY","18 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While access control mechanisms cannot always prevent the insiders from misusing sensitive data (since, in most of the cases, authorized users within organizations are granted access permissions), malicious outsiders also pose severe threats due to different security vulnerabilities in the systems, e.g., phishing attacks, memory corruptions, etc., which enable them to steal the credentials of the authorized users who have access to the data. To protect sensitive data from such attackers, anomaly detection techniques are often combined with other existing security measures, e.g., access control and encryption. An anomaly detection technique for identifying anomalies in file system accesses is based on the key idea that there should be significant differences between the file access behaviors of a benign user and an attacker. In this article, we propose an approach to create fine-grained profiles of the users’ regular file access activities while extensively analyzing the timestamp information of the file accesses. According to our observation, even if a user’s access to a file seems benign, only a fine-grained analysis of the access (such as the size of access, the timestamp of access) can determine the original intention of the user. We exploit the users’ file access information at the block level to model their regular file access behaviors (user profiles) which are then securely stored and used for identifying anomalous file system accesses in the detection phase. We are also able to automatically profile new files and new users added to the system dynamically.

These two datasets contain several adversarial obfuscation techniques that were applied onto malicious as well as legitimate traffic samples during “the execution” of their TCP network connections. Adversarial obfuscation techniques were used for evading machine learning-based network intrusion detection classifiers. We show that the performance of such classifiers can be improved when partially augmenting their training data by samples obtained from obfuscation techniques. In detail, we utilized tunneling obfuscation in HTTP(S) protocol and non-payload-based obfuscations modifying various properties of network traffic by, e.g., TCP segmentation, re-transmissions, corrupting and reordering of packets, etc. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first collection of network traffic data that contains adversarial techniques and is intended for non-payload-based network intrusion detection and adversarial classification.

In this paper, we examine how the incorporation of knowledge related to an adversary's purpose can improve the effectiveness of spectrum scanning protocols. First, we study the difference in the thief's behavior when considering throughput and delay as the two primary QoS parameters he is concerned with. Through our analysis, we show that the detection probability of unlicensed access to spectrum resources depends on the application type. Knowledge of the application type can be incorporated to spectrum scanning to tune better it to detect the thief. To illustrate this, we examine two Bayesian games. In the first game, the scanner wants to minimize the time needed to detect the invader. In the second game, the scanner wants to maximize the detection probability at each time slot by adapting its belief regarding the adversary's activity. In particular, it is shown in the minimizing detection time game that the equilibrium strategies are continuous with respect to priori knowledge of the invader's activity. Meanwhile, for the maximizing detection probability game, the strategies can have a jump discontinuity. This phenomena can be explained as the difference between tactical and strategic decision making: tactical decision making allows short-term, unpredictable moves, while strategic decision making is inclined to predictable moves. Finally, since the bandwidth model used in this paper is general, the conclusion as well as the approach provided can be applied to a variety of different network protection problems.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2510959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7362001","Intrusion detection;wireless networks;Bayes methods","Signal to noise ratio;Interference;Games;Jamming;Throughput;Delays;Security","Bayes methods;game theory;probability;protocols;radio spectrum management","bandwidth monitoring strategy;spectrum scanning protocol;QoS;Bayesian game theory;detection probability game;decision making;network protection problem","","29","","32","IEEE","22 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although standard anomaly detection methods usually assume that instances are independent and identically distributed, in many real-world applications, instances are often explicitly connected, resulting in so-called attributed graphs. The proposed method embeds nodes (instances) on the attributed graph in a latent space by taking into account their attributes as well as the graph structure on the basis of graph convolutional networks (GCNs). To learn node embeddings specialized for anomaly detection, in which there is a class imbalance due to the rarity of anomalies, the parameters of a GCN are trained to minimize the volume of a hypersphere that encloses the node embeddings of normal instances while embedding anomalous ones outside the hypersphere. This enables us to detect anomalies by simply calculating the distances between the node embeddings and hypersphere center. The proposed method can effectively propagate label information on a small amount of nodes to unlabeled ones by taking into account the node's attributes, graph structure, and class imbalance. In experiments with five real-world attributed graph datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms various existing anomaly detection methods.","2161-4407","978-1-6654-3900-8","10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9533507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9533507","","Training;Neural networks;Anomaly detection;Standards","","","","","","61","","20 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, many challenges arise since malicious attacks are continually changing and are occurring in very large volumes requiring a scalable solution. There are different malware datasets available publicly for further research by cyber security community. However, no existing study has shown the detailed analysis of the performance of various machine learning algorithms on various publicly available datasets. Due to the dynamic nature of malware with continuously changing attacking methods, the malware datasets available publicly are to be updated systematically and benchmarked. In this paper, a deep neural network (DNN), a type of deep learning model, is explored to develop a flexible and effective IDS to detect and classify unforeseen and unpredictable cyberattacks. The continuous change in network behavior and rapid evolution of attacks makes it necessary to evaluate various datasets which are generated over the years through static and dynamic approaches. This type of study facilitates to identify the best algorithm which can effectively work in detecting future cyberattacks. A comprehensive evaluation of experiments of DNNs and other classical machine learning classifiers are shown on various publicly available benchmark malware datasets. The optimal network parameters and network topologies for DNNs are chosen through the following hyperparameter selection methods with KDDCup 99 dataset. All the experiments of DNNs are run till 1,000 epochs with the learning rate varying in the range [0.01-0.5]. The DNN model which performed well on KDDCup 99 is applied on other datasets, such as NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, Kyoto, WSN-DS, and CICIDS 2017, to conduct the benchmark. Our DNN model learns the abstract and high-dimensional feature representation of the IDS data by passing them into many hidden layers. Through a rigorous experimental testing, it is confirmed that DNNs perform well in comparison with the classical machine learning classifiers. Finally, we propose a highly scalable and hybrid DNNs framework called scale-hybrid-IDS-AlertNet which can be used in real-time to effectively monitor the network traffic and host-level events to proactively alert possible cyberattacks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2895334","Paramount Computer Systems; Lakhshya Cyber Security Labs; Department of Corporate and Information Services, Northern Territory Government of Australia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8681044","Cyber security;intrusion detection;malware;big data;machine learning;deep learning;deep neural networks;cyberattacks;cybercrime","Intrusion detection;Computer security;Deep learning;Malware;Benchmark testing","invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification","intelligent intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;network-level;malicious attacks;cyber security community;publicly available datasets;attacking methods;deep neural network;deep learning model;flexible IDS;effective IDS;continuous change;network behavior;static approaches;dynamic approaches;classical machine learning classifiers;publicly available benchmark malware datasets;optimal network parameters;network topologies;KDDCup 99 dataset;learning rate;DNN model;IDS data;scale-hybrid-IDS-AlertNet;network traffic;host-level events;malware datasets;unforeseen cyberattack detection;unforeseen cyberattack classification;unpredictable cyberattack detection;unpredictable cyberattack classification;hybrid DNN framework;highly scalable DNN framework","","121","","79","OAPA","3 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most learning methods, however, have not been designed with security in mind and thus are vulnerable to different types of attacks. This problem has motivated the research field of adversarial machine learning that is concerned with attacking and defending learning methods. Concurrently, a separate line of research has tackled a very similar problem: In digital watermarking, a pattern is embedded in a signal in the presence of an adversary. As a consequence, this research field has also extensively studied techniques for attacking and defending watermarking methods. The two research communities have worked in parallel so far, unnoticeably developing similar attack and defense strategies. This paper is a first effort to bring these communities together. To this end, we present a unified notation of blackbox attacks against machine learning and watermarking. To demonstrate its efficacy, we apply concepts from watermarking to machine learning and vice versa. We show that countermeasures from watermarking can mitigate recent model-extraction attacks and, similarly, that techniques for hardening machine learning can fend off oracle attacks against watermarks. We further demonstrate a novel threat for watermarking schemes based on recent deep learning attacks from adversarial learning. Our work provides a conceptual link between two research fields and thereby opens novel directions for improving the security of both, machine learning and digital watermarking.","","978-1-5386-4228-3","10.1109/EuroSP.2018.00041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8406619","Adversarial Learning;Digital Watermarking;Adversarial Signal Processing;Machine Learning;adversarial machine learning","Watermarking;Machine learning;Learning systems;Feature extraction;Media;Detectors","invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);watermarking","digital watermarking;machine learning;attack unification;deep learning attacks;blackbox attacks;model-extraction attacks","","10","","70","","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the training phase, we use the encoder of O-GAN to learn the latent representation of normal data, namely the code of normal data, and then use the kernel density estimation to solve the probability density function of code. The code of normal sample obtained through the trained encoder can get a larger probability value when passing through the trained kernel density estimator, while the code of anomalous sample can get a smaller probability value, so as to achieve the purpose of anomaly detection.

CHAMELEON offers two environments: standard–for software identified as benign by the first phase, and uncertain–for software received borderline classification from the first phase. The uncertain environment adds obstacles to software execution through random perturbations applied probabilistically. We introduce a dynamic perturbation threshold that can target malware disproportionately more than benign software. We analyzed the effects of the uncertain environment by manually studying 113 software and 100 malware, and found that 92% malware and 10% benign software disrupted during execution. The results were then corroborated by an extended dataset (5,679 Linux malware samples) on a newer system.

In the case of software-defined networks (SDN), not only the connected devices and services but also the SDN controllers may be subjected to intrusion attempts. The advent of efficient and robust machine learning (ML) algorithms along with the availability of a large number of network datasets enabled the development of ML-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Recent work has demonstrated that ML-based NIDS systems are vulnerable to evasion attacks where the adversary targets the ML classifier in the NIDS system to evade detection by performing various packet perturbations. In this work, we propose an approach to build robust ML based NIDS systems that use multiple ML classifiers trained with reduced feature sets. Our approach depends on a careful feature selection procedure based on Permutation Feature Importance, a wrapper based feature engineering method.

In the IIoT ecosystem, devices of industrial applications communicate with each other with little human intervention. They need to act intelligently to safeguard the data confidentiality and devices' authenticity. The ability to gather, process, and store real-time data depends on the quality of data, network connectivity, and processing capabilities of these devices. Pervasive edge computing (PEC) is gaining popularity nowadays due to the resource limitations imposed on the sensor-embedded IIoT devices. PEC processes the gathered data at the network edge to reduce the response time for these devices. However, PEC faces numerous research challenges in terms of secured communication, network connectivity, and resource utilization of the edge servers. To address these challenges, we propose a secured and intelligent communication scheme for PEC in an IIoT-enabled infrastructure. In the proposed scheme, forged identities of adversaries, i.e., Sybil devices, are detected by IIoT devices and shared with edge servers to prevent upstream transmission of their malicious data. Upon Sybil attack detection, each edge server executes a parallel artificial bee colony (pABC) algorithm to perform optimal network configuration of IIoT devices. Each edge server performs the job migration to their neighboring servers for load balancing and better network performance, based on their processing and storage capabilities. The experimental results justify the efficiency of our proposed scheme in terms of Sybil attack detection, the convergence curves of our pABC algorithm, delay, throughput, and control overhead of data communication using PEC for IIoT.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2020.3037872","Center for Research in Human Movement Variability; NIH(grant numbers:P20GM109090); Collaboration Initiative of the University of Nebraska System; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9259232","Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm;artificial intelligence (AI);industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);pervasive edge computing (PEC);security","Performance evaluation;Cloud computing;Image edge detection;Servers;Industrial Internet of Things;Edge computing;Convergence","artificial bee colony algorithm;computer network security;data communication;Internet of Things;network servers;production engineering computing;resource allocation","secured intelligent communication scheme;IIoT-enabled pervasive edge computing;data exchanges;industrial processes;artificial intelligence;cyber-physical systems;IIoT ecosystem;industrial applications;data confidentiality;real-time data;network connectivity;PEC;sensor-embedded IIoT devices;network edge;secured communication scheme;IIoT-enabled infrastructure;Sybil devices;malicious data;Sybil attack detection;edge server;parallel artificial bee colony;optimal network configuration;network performance;storage capabilities;data communication;Industrial Internet of Things","","4","","24","IEEE","13 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

AL has to be done by means of a data set where a low fraction of samples (also termed data points or observations) are labeled. To obtain labels for the unlabeled samples, the active learner has to ask an oracle (e.g., a human expert) for labels. In most cases, the goal is to maximize some metric assessing the task performance (e.g., the classification accuracy) and to minimize the number of queries at the same time. In this article, we first briefly discuss the state-of-the-art in the field of AL. Then, we propose the concept of dedicated collaborative interactive learning (D-CIL) and describe some research challenges. With D-CIL, we will overcome many of the harsh limitations of current AL. In particular, we envision scenarios where the expert may be wrong for various reasons. There also might be several or even many experts with different expertise who collaborate, the experts may label not only samples but also supply knowledge at a higher level such as rules, and we consider that the labeling costs depend on many conditions. Moreover, human experts may even profit by improving their own knowledge when they get feedback from the active learner.","","978-3-8007-4157-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7499239","","","","","","1","","","","27 Jun 2016","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

These attacks pose many challenges for network security personnel to protect the computer and network nodes and corresponding data from possible intrusions. A network intrusion detection system (NIDS) can act as one of the efficient security solutions by constantly monitoring the network traffic to secure the entry points of a network. Despite enormous efforts by researchers, NIDS still suffers from a high false alarm rate (FAR) in detecting novel attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel NIDS framework based on a deep convolution neural network that utilizes network spectrogram images generated using the short-time Fourier transform. To test the efficiency of our proposed solution, we evaluated it using the CIC-IDS2017 dataset. The experimental results have shown about 2.5% - 4% improvement in accurately detecting intrusions compared to other deep learning (DL) algorithms while at the same time reducing the FAR by 4.3%-6.7% considering binary classification scenario.

However, the classification algorithm has neglected the classification under adversarial environment, so instead they will modify the features of test data in order to spoof the classifier so as to escape its detection. In this paper, we will consider to modify the feature value of the test samples in accordance with attack algorithm proposed by Battista Biggio and further improve the algorithm. As each feature has a range of independent constraints, so the algorithm should be transformed into a constrained optimization problem.

The growing popularity of wireless local area networks (WLANs) increases the risk of wireless security attacks. A fake AP can be set in any public space in order to impersonate legitimate APs for monetization. Existing fake AP detection methods analyze wireless traffic by using extra devices, and the traffic is collected by servers. However, using these server-side methods is costly and only provide secure communication, in limited places, of clients' devices. Recently, several fake AP detection methods have been designed in order to overcome the server-side problems in a client-side. However, there are two limitations to the client-side methods: cumbersome processes and limited resources. When the methods attempt to collect data, calculating interval time incurs time-consuming processes to detect fake characteristics in the client-side. Moreover, the operating systems in smartphones provide limited resources that can hardly be adopted in the client-side. In this paper, we propose a novel fake AP detection method to solve the aforementioned problems in the client-side. The method leverages received signal strengths (RSSs) and online detection algorithm. Our method collects RSSs from nearby APs and normalizes them for accurate measurement. We measure the similarity of normalized RSSs. If the similarity between normalized RSSs is less than the fixed threshold value, we determine that the RSSs are generated from a fake device. We can measure the optimal threshold value derived from the sequential hypothesis testing. In our experiment, when the fixed threshold value was 2, the true positive was over than 99% and the false positive was less than 0.1% in three observations.","1550-2252","978-1-4673-0990-5","10.1109/VETECS.2012.6240312","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240312","","Communication system security;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Testing;Portable computers;Servers;Clocks","mobile handsets;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","fake access points;received signal strengths;smartphone users;wireless local area networks;WLAN;wireless security attacks;fake AP detection;wireless traffic;server-side methods;client devices;client-side methods;time-consuming processes;online detection algorithm;normalized RSS;optimal threshold value;sequential hypothesis testing","","16","1","15","","16 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cybersecurity capabilities of power systems rely on a deep understanding of potential cyberattacks for identifying and protecting against cyber vulnerabilities. The common assumption of system network information in most existing works is suspicious, which fails to hold in practical fields. This paper proposes a novel data-driven false data injection attack method, where only easily accessible measurement data are required, i.e., power injections at buses, flows of lines and the tie line information (connection relationship and power measurement data).

The ability of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to discover new types of malicious network packets has been explored in many research works in the past. In our study, we present an experimental analysis to empirically find the optimal parameter settings of 22 classification techniques from 9 machine learning families. To investigate the studied algorithms, we choose 4 widely used IDS datasets that resemble real-world network traffic for both benign and malicious activities. We conduct experiments on binary classification, i.e., given an IDS log, we predict whether the log is either benign or malicious, on such datasets. Moreover, we take a step further to analyze such algorithms' performances on multiclass classification; for example, we aim to detect the type of the attack from each dataset. As similar work in this domain is very limited to none, our study will play a vital role to select the optimal parameter settings for a certain studied classification algorithm.","","978-1-6654-2244-4","10.1109/ICCIT51783.2020.9392683","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9392683","Intrusion Detection System;Machine Learning;Parameter Optimization","Machine learning algorithms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Telecommunication traffic;Prediction algorithms;Classification algorithms;Optimization","computer crime;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;trusted computing","IDS log;multiclass classification;binary classification;real-world network traffic;machine learning;malicious network packets;cyber threats;cyber attacks;intrusion detection system;performance analysis;parameter optimization","","","","34","","6 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our previous work revealed a critical problem with conventional machine learning models. Conventional models are unable to generalize on the temporal nature of network flow data to classify attacks. We thus explored the use of deep learning techniques on real flow data. We found that a variety of attacks could be identified with high accuracy compared to previous approaches.

This exposure to insecure networks can cause the Wi-Fi calling users to suffer from security threats. Its security mechanisms are similar to the VoLTE, because both of them are supported by the IMS.

However, standard classification tools often perform poorly, because an adaptive attacker can shape his attacks in response to the algorithm. This has led to the recent interest in developing methods for adversarial classification, but to the best of our knowledge, there have been a very few prior studies that take into account the attacker's tradeoff between adapting to the classifier being used against him with his desire to maintain the efficacy of his attack. Including this effect is a key to derive solutions that perform well in practice. In this investigation, we model the interaction as a game between a defender who chooses a classifier to distinguish between attacks and normal behavior based on a set of observed features and an attacker who chooses his attack features (class 1 data). Normal behavior (class 0 data) is random and exogenous. The attacker's objective balances the benefit from attacks and the cost of being detected while the defender's objective balances the benefit of a correct attack detection and the cost of false alarm. We provide an efficient algorithm to compute all Nash equilibria and a compact characterization of the possible forms of a Nash equilibrium that reveals intuitive messages on how to perform classification in the presence of an attacker. We also explore qualitatively and quantitatively the impact of the non-attacker and underlying parameters on the equilibrium strategies.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2017.2718494","AFOSR(grant numbers:FA9550-09-1-0049); NSF(grant numbers:CNS-0910711,CNS-0953884); Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7954621","Adversarial classification;game theory;security;Nash equilibrium;threshold strategies;randomization","Games;Security;Nash equilibrium;Machine learning algorithms;Standards;Computational modeling","game theory;linear programming;pattern classification;security of data","linear programming;Nash equilibria;attack detection;adversarial classification;game-theoretic analysis","","8","","57","IEEE","21 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Stealthy adversarial examples and backdoor attacks can easily fool deep neural networks to generate the wrong results. The risk of adversarial examples attacks that target deep learning models impedes the wide deployment of deep neural networks in safety-critical environments. In this work we propose a defensive technique for deep learning by combining activation function and neurons pruning to reduce the effects of adversarial examples and backdoor attacks. We evaluate the efficacy of the method on an anomaly detection application using Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Coupled Generative Adversarial Network (CoGAN). The method reduces the loss of accuracy from the attacks from an average 10% to 2% using DBN and from an average 14% to 2% using CoGAN.

Through sensors and actuators, ECUs maintain critical vehicle functions such as transmission and engine control. However, security was never a part of CAN design and hence ECUs are susceptible to a wide range of attacks. Thus, in recent years, several anomaly detection systems have been proposed for the CAN bus in order to detect anomalies caused by adversarial attacks or misbehaving sensors. These systems generally try to detect deviations from individual sensor's expected behavior. As such, they are ineffective against attacks that target multiple sensors to accomplish a collective desired behavior without changing the expected behavior of each individual sensor. In this paper, we focus on detecting such attacks by identifying contextual CAN anomalies in realtime. To this end, we present NeuroCAN, a deep learning-based detection system that utilizes Linear embeddings and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) units to learn the spatio-temporal correlations among sensor data on the CAN bus at a frame level. By exploiting such correlations, NeuroCAN is able to detect contextual anomalies that are otherwise difficult to detect by analyzing individual sensor data. We evaluate NeuroCAN using two publicly available CAN datasets and compare it against existing approaches. Our results show that NeuroCAN achieves over 95% detection accuracy and performs significantly better than the existing baselines.","2687-8860","978-1-6654-4919-9","10.1109/ISC253183.2021.9562830","Alberta Innovates; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9562830","","Training;Correlation;Smart cities;Sensor systems;Sensors;Synchronization;Security","","","","","","26","","15 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By introducing the maximum entropy (MaxENT) models into the rule optimization for the Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model, this paper proposes an improved BLP model with the self-learning function: MaxENT-BLP. This model first formalizes the security properties, system states, transformational rules, and a constraint model based on the states transition of the MaxENT. After handling the historical system access logs as the original data sets, this model extracts the user requests, current states, and decisions to act as the feature vectors. Second, we use k -fold cross validation to divide all vectors into a training set and a testing set. In this paper, the model training process is based on the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. And this model contains a strategy update algorithm to adjust the access control rules dynamically according to the access and decision records in a system. Third, we prove that MaxENT-BLP is secure through theoretical analysis. By estimating the precision, recall, and F1-score, the experiments show the availability and accuracy of this model. Finally, this paper provides the process of model training based on deep learning and discussions regarding adversarial samples from the malware classifiers.

Our approach addresses three problems. First, we build a diverse pool of mining models to improve robustness of a variety of mining algorithms. These methods are similar to ensemble learning but optimize the tradeoff between mining quality and robustness. These methods also require very little modification to existing algorithms. Second, we randomly select a subset of models at run time (when the model is used for detection) to further boost robustness. Third, we propose a theoretical framework that bounds the minimal number of features an attacker needs to modify given a set of selected models.","","978-1-5386-3221-5","10.1109/CSE-EUC.2017.240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8006017","hierarchical routing protocols;wireless sensor networks;Lifetime;Reliability","Data mining;Data models;Computer security;Vegetation;Robustness;Computational modeling;Real-time systems","data mining;security of data","data mining;cyber security;ensemble learning;mining quality;mining robustness","","","","11","","10 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, an adversarial example, created by adding a little noise to the original sample, can cause misclassification by the DNN. As adversarial examples are a serious threat to DNNs, there has been much research into the generation of adversarial examples designed for attacking DNNs. The adversarial example attack is divided into two categories: targeted adversarial example and untargeted adversarial example. The targeted adversarial example attack causes machines to misinterpret an object as the attacker's desired class. In contrast, the untargeted adversarial example causes machines to misinterpret an object as an incorrect class. In this paper, we focus on an untargeted adversarial example scenario because it has less distortion from the original sample and a faster learning time than a targeted adversarial example scenario. However, there is a pattern problem in generating untargeted adversarial examples: Because of the similarity between the original class and specific classes, it may be possible for the defending system to determine the original class by analyzing the output classes of the untargeted adversarial examples. To overcome this problem, we propose a new method for generating untargeted adversarial examples, one that uses an arbitrary class in the generation process. For experimental datasets, we used MNIST and CIFAR10, and the Tensorflow library was employed as the machine learning library. Through our experiment, we show that the proposed method can generate random untargeted adversarial examples that do not focus on a specific class for a given original class, while keeping distortion to a minimum (1.99 and 42.32 on MNIST and CIFAR10, respectively) and maintaining a 100% attack success rate.","2155-7586","978-1-5386-7185-6","10.1109/MILCOM.2018.8599707","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8599707","Deep neural network;adversarial example;untargeted adversarial example;random selection","Neural networks;Distortion;Target recognition;Distortion measurement;Mathematical model;Computer security;Military computing","learning (artificial intelligence);military computing;neural nets;security of data","random untargeted adversarial example;targeted adversarial example attack;untargeted adversarial example scenario;targeted adversarial example scenario;neural network;military environments;DNN;MNIST;CIFAR10;Tensorflow library;machine learning library;attack success rate","","1","","21","","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unknown vehicle security vulnerabilities trigger a race among adversaries to exploit the weaknesses and security experts to mitigate the vulnerability. In this study, we identified opportunities for adversaries to take control of the in-vehicle network, which can compromise the safety, privacy, reliability, efficiency, and security of the transportation system. This study contributes in three ways to the literature of ITS security and resiliency. First, we aggregate individual risks that are associated with hacking the in-vehicle network to determine system-level risk. Second, we employ a risk-based model to conduct a qualitative vulnerability-oriented risk assessment. Third, we identify the consequences of hacking the in-vehicle network through a risk-based approach, using an impact-likelihood matrix.

Owed to its wide-spread use and Javascript support, PDF has been the primary vehicle for delivering embedded exploits. Unfortunately, existing defenses are limited in effectiveness, vulnerable to evasion, or computationally expensive to be employed as an on-line protection system. In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for detection and confinement of malicious Javascript in PDF. Our approach statically extracts a set of static features and inserts context monitoring code into a document. When an instrumented document is opened, the context monitoring code inside will cooperate with our runtime monitor to detect potential infection attempts in the context of Javascript execution. Thus, our detector can identify malicious documents by using both static and runtime features. To validate the effectiveness of our approach in a real world setting, we first conduct a security analysis, showing that our system is able to remain effective in detection and be robust against evasion attempts even in the presence of sophisticated adversaries. We implement a prototype of the proposed system, and perform extensive experiments using 18623 benign PDF samples and 7370 malicious samples.

The protocol decomposes the outlier detection algorithm into several phases and recognizes the necessary cryptographic operations in each phase. It realizes several cryptographic modules via efficient and interchangeable protocols to support the above cryptographic operations and composes them in the overall protocol to enable outlier detection over encrypted data sets. To support efficient updates, it integrates the sliding window model to periodically evict the expired data in order to maintain a constant update time.

The theoretical description is derived from a running example. The benefit of this game-theoretic perspective is at least threefold, as it 1) helps to systematize the threat and respective mitigation actions (by turning them into pure strategies for the gameplay); 2) provides optimized actions for defense and attack, where the latter can be taken as a (nonunique) indication of neuralgic points; and 3) provides quantitative measures of resilience against an APT, in terms that can be defined freely by a security officer.

Kizzle is able to generate anti-virus signatures for detecting EKs, which compare favorably to manually created ones. Kizzle is highly responsive and can generate new signatures within hours. Our experiments show that Kizzle produces high-accuracy signatures. When evaluated over a four-week period, false-positive rates for Kizzle are under 0.03%, while the false-negative rates are under 5%.","2158-3927","978-1-4673-8891-7","10.1109/DSN.2016.48","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7579763","malware;exploit kit;signature generation","Malware;Payloads;Browsers;Security;Engines;Detectors","computer viruses;digital signatures;program compilers;software engineering","Kizzle;signature compiler;exploit kit detection;EK detection;malware;software engineering;antivirus signature generation","","11","1","42","","3 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years a lot of effort is focused on developing automatic detection of cyber-attacks using data mining techniques on the data generated from network traffic. In this paper a methodology for automatic detection of cyber-attacks is proposed. To improve the performance, the network traffic data is first preprocessed by filtering and combining features from the original data. The new augmented and refined data is then used to build a classification model that can discriminate between normal network traffic and cyber-attacks. Experimental scenarios are set up to evaluate the effect of preprocessing on the final performance, and additionally to provide insight on possible recommendations in terms of a most suitable classification algorithm. The obtained results indicate performance improvement with data preprocessing. All used classification algorithms provide very high AUC of over 0.95 which attests that the proposed methodology is highly promising for the development and improvement of current and future cyber-attacks detection systems.","","978-1-5386-7171-9","10.1109/TELFOR.2018.8612072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8612072","Cyber-attacks;data mining;preprocessing","Classification algorithms;Data mining;Data preprocessing;Telecommunication traffic;Data models;Computer science;Feature extraction","computer network security;data mining;pattern classification;security of data","knowledge discovery;managing security;high-speed networks;suspicious anomalies;automatic detection;data mining techniques;network traffic data;original data;augmented data;refined data;normal network traffic;performance improvement;data preprocessing;future cyber-attacks detection systems","","","","14","","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hyper calls enable intrusions in hypervisors through their hyper call interfaces. Despite the importance, there is very limited publicly available information on vulnerabilities of hyper call handlers and attacks triggering them, which significantly hinders advances towards monitoring and securing these interfaces. In this paper, we characterize the hyper call attack surface based on analyzing a set of vulnerabilities of hyper call handlers.

While the application of machine learning-based techniques has become a trend in cyber security, the main focus has been almost on detection accuracy. However, providing the relevant explanation for a detection decision is a vital requirement in a tiered incident handling processes of the contemporary security operations centers. Moreover, the design of intrusion detection systems in IoT networks has to take the limitations of the computational resources into consideration. Therefore, resource limitations in addition to human element of incident handling necessitate considering feature selection and interpretability at the same time in machine learning workflows. In this paper, first, we analyzed the selection of features and its implication on the data accuracy. Second, we investigated the impact of feature selection on the explanations generated at the post-hoc interpretation phase. We utilized a filter method, Fisher's Score and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) at feature selection and post-hoc interpretation phases, respectively. To evaluate the quality of explanations, we proposed a metric that reflects the need of the security analysts. It is demonstrated that the application of both steps for the particular case of IoT botnet detection may result in highly accurate and interpretable learning models induced by fewer features. Our metric enables us to evaluate the detection accuracy and interpretability in an integrated way.","","978-1-7281-4550-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2019.00193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8999281","Botnet detection;machine learning;interpretation","Feature extraction;Machine learning;Measurement;Botnet;Intrusion detection;Computer security","computer network security;feature selection;Internet of Things;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence)","feature selection;machine learning workflow;Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation;IoT botnet detection;highly accurate learning models;interpretable learning models;detection accuracy;machine learning-based techniques;detection decision;security operations centers;intrusion detection systems;IoT networks;post-hoc local interpretation;Fisher score;post-hoc interpretation;cyber security;tiered incident handling process;security analysis;data accuracy;computational resources","","1","","23","","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To deal with security concerns of in-vehicle networks, various deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL) have been developed to enhance in-vehicle security. However, the DL/RL agents are vulnerable to adversarial perturbation, where an attacker can perform a manipulation attack to interfere with the agent's operation. In this work, we aim to develop two key mechanisms to build secure in-vehicle networks: (1) RL-based proactive defense mechanism to achieve multiple objectives of minimizing system security vulnerabilities while maximizing service availability; and (2) a resilient RL method that allows an agent to operate in the presence of adversarial disturbances that neutralize the system security. To this end, we propose, DESOLATER (Drl-based rESOurce aLlocation And mTd dEployment fRamework), which is a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (mDRL)-based network slicing technique that can help determine two key network management decisions: (1) link bandwidth allocation to meet quality-of-service (QoS) requirements; and (2) the frequency of triggering IP shuffling as a proactive defense mechanism not to hinder service availability by maintaining normal system operations. We also introduce an anomaly detection mechanism with a memory-based RL technique to enhance the resiliency of the RL agents in a partially observable environment under the situation that adversarial attackers manipulating observation information. Through extensive simulation experiments, we validate that the proposed robust mDRL algorithm can help the deployed proactive security mechanism achieve both security and network performance improvement in the presence of adversarial attacks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3076599","U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) International Technology Center-Pacific (ITC-PAC); CCDC Army Research Laboratory (CCDC-ARL)(grant numbers:FA5209-19-P-A056); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9418999","Deep reinforcement learning;in-vehicle network;moving target defense;network slicing;partial observability;software-defined networking","Security;Protocols;Control systems;IP networks;Resource management;Bandwidth;Network slicing","deep learning (artificial intelligence);minimisation;mobility management (mobile radio);multi-agent systems;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","in-vehicle security networks;autonomous driving technologies;moving target defense deployment framework;deep reinforcement learning-based resource allocation;network performance improvement;deployed proactive security mechanism;adversarial attackers;memory-based RL technique;anomaly detection mechanism;quality-of-service requirements;key network management decisions;multiagent deep reinforcement learning-based network slicing technique;mTd dEployment fRamework;Drl-based rESOurce;DESOLATER;adversarial disturbances;resilient RL method;service availability;system security vulnerabilities;manipulation attack;adversarial perturbation;electronic equipment","","","","37","CCBYNCND","29 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, for automated vehicle safety, if the security of V2X network cannot be guaranteed, automated vehicles may not obtain required correct information, which is a fatal problem. In V2X network, black hole and gray hole attacks are critical threats of network availability and may prevent legitimate users from receiving packets. In this review, the definition, classification and impact of the attacks on V2X network are presented, and the detection and prevention technologies are classified and analyzed, respectively. Finally, three open issues and future trends are proposed, which are considering specific characters of V2X network, paying attention to artificial intelligent technologies in detection and utilizing edge computing architecture as the local trusted environment in detection and prevention.","","978-1-7281-4149-7","10.1109/ITSC45102.2020.9294227","Hubei University of Automotive Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9294227","","Vehicle-to-everything;Routing;Routing protocols;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Delays;Throughput","artificial intelligence;computer network security;mobile computing;vehicular ad hoc networks","gray hole attacks;V2X Network;automated vehicle safety;required correct information;black hole attacks;network availability;classification;prevention technologies;security issues;Vehicle-to-X network;artificial intelligent technologies;edge computing architecture;local trusted environment","","","","23","","24 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Advanced attacks pursue maximized impact at minimized costs and detectability. This paper conducts risk analysis of combined data integrity and availability attacks against the power system state estimation. We compare the combined attacks with pure integrity attacks-false data injection (FDI) attacks. A security index for vulnerability assessment to these two kinds of attacks is proposed and formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem. We show that such combined attacks can succeed with fewer resources than FDI attacks. The combined attacks with limited knowledge of the system model also expose advantages in keeping stealth against the bad data detection. Finally, the risk of combined attacks to reliable system operation is evaluated using the results from vulnerability assessment and attack impact analysis. The findings in this paper are validated and supported by a detailed case study.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2018.2817387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8320388","Combined integrity and availability attack;false data injection;risk analysis;power system state estimation","Transmission line measurements;Transmission line matrix methods;Power systems;Security;Indexes;State estimation;Network topology","computer network security;integer programming;linear programming;power engineering computing;power system security;power system state estimation;risk analysis;security of data;smart power grids","FDI attacks;attack impact analysis;cyber risk analysis;power system state estimation;smart grid cyber attacks;advanced attacks;data attacks;risk analysis;data integrity;false data injection;mixed integer linear programming problem;bad data detection","","18","","37","IEEE","20 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
