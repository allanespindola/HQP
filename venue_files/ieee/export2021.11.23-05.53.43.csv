However, this is not necessarily true in the case of failures caused by malicious attacks, because attackers can easily reuse their skills and tools across different subsystems under similar configurations. Taking this into consideration, this paper introduces the factor of security (FoS) metrics to quantify the security effectiveness of redundant subsystems in smart grids.

It is used to calculate the Area Control Error (ACE) based on frequency and tie-line power flow between balancing areas, and then adjust power generation to maintain the power system frequency in an acceptable range. However, attackers might inject malicious frequency or tie-line power flow measurements to mislead AGC to do false generation correction which will harm the power grid operation. Such attacks are hard to be detected since they do not violate physical power system models. In this work, we propose algorithms based on Neural Network and Fourier Transform to detect data forgery attacks in AGC. Different from the few previous work that rely on accurate load prediction to detect data forgery, our solution only uses the ACE data already available in existing AGC systems. In particular, our solution learns the normal patterns of ACE time series and detects abnormal patterns caused by artificial attacks.

An IDS like the popular Snort[17] detects attacks on the network using a database of previous attacks. So in order to detect these attack strings in the packet, Snort uses the Aho-Corasick algorithm. This algorithm first constructs a Finite State Machine (FSM) from the attack strings, and subsequently traverses the FSM using bytes from the packet. We observe that there are input bytes that result in a traversal of a series of FSM states (also viewed as pointers). This chain of pointer traversal significantly degrades (22X) the processing time of an input byte. Such a wide variance in the processing time of an input byte can be exploited by an adversary to throttle the IDS. If the IDS is unable to keep pace with the network traffic, the IDS gets disabled. So in the process the network becomes vulnerable. Attacks done in this manner are referred to as algorithmic complexity attacks, and arise due to weaknesses in IDS processing. In this work, we explore defense mechanisms to the above outlined algorithmic complexity attack. Our proposed mechanisms provide over 3X improvement in the worst-case performance.","","978-1-4673-0974-5","10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6270773","Intrusion Detection Systems;Defense Mechanisms;Hardware Support","Payloads;Hardware;Databases;Clocks;Optimization;Software;Complexity theory","computational complexity;computer network security;finite state machines;string matching","software mechanisms;IDS protection;algorithmic complexity attacks;hardware mechanisms;intrusion detection systems;Aho-Corasick algorithm;finite state machine;FSM states;processing time;network traffic;IDS processing;intrusion defense mechanisms;worst-case performance;string detection","","","","25","","20 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the success of DNNs, these systems can be exploited by what is termed adversarial examples. An adversarial example, in which a small distortion is added to the input data, can be designed to be misclassified by the DNN while remaining undetected by humans or other systems. Such adversarial examples have been studied mainly in the image domain. Recently, however, studies on adversarial examples have been expanding into the voice domain. For example, when an adversarial example is applied to enemy wiretapping devices (victim classifiers) in a military environment, the enemy device will misinterpret the intended message. In such scenarios, it is necessary that friendly wiretapping devices (protected classifiers) should not be deceived. Therefore, the selective adversarial example concept can be useful in mixed situations, defined as situations in which there is both a classifier to be protected and a classifier to be attacked. In this paper, we propose a selective audio adversarial example with minimum distortion that will be misclassified as the target phrase by a victim classifier but correctly classified as the original phrase by a protected classifier. To generate such examples, a transformation is carried out to minimize the probability of incorrect classification by the protected classifier and that of correct classification by the victim classifier. We conducted experiments targeting the state-of-the-art DeepSpeech voice recognition model using Mozilla Common Voice datasets and the Tensorflow library. They showed that the proposed method can generate a selective audio adversarial example with a 91.67% attack success rate and 85.67% protected classifier accuracy.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2019.2925452","National Research Foundation of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:2017R1A2B4006026); Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion; Korean Government (MSIT) (2016-0-00173, Security Technologies for Financial Fraud Prevention on Fintech); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8747397","Deep neural network (DNN);recursive neural network (RNN);adversarial example;machine learning;speech recognition","Hidden Markov models;Distortion;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Speech recognition;Image recognition;Distortion measurement;Neural networks","audio signal processing;distortion;neural nets;probability;security of data;signal classification;speech recognition","selective audio adversarial example;victim classifier;protected classifier;speech recognition system;selective adversarial example concept;evasion attack;deep neural networks;minimum distortion;DeepSpeech voice recognition model;Mozilla common voice datasets;attack success rate;probability","","4","","49","IEEE","27 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, while the benefits of the IIoT are undeniable, their pervasive adoption as key enablers for future industries also paved the way for new security risks. In fact, the damaging effects of exploiting vulnerable IIoT have been repeatedly demonstrated and publicly reported. The Mirai botnet, various reports on hackable and invasive devices, alongside the infamous Stuxnet malware, constitute significant proof on the undisputed and disruptive effect of the malware-targeting IIoT systems. As a response, a plethora of solutions has been developed to address the issue of securing IIoT systems in specific sectors. Nevertheless, we believe that the gradual decay of the IIoT's physical dimension (e.g., the physical process), also called aging, is a natural component of the IIoT's life cycle, which has not received sufficient attention from the scientific community. This paper develops a methodology for detecting abnormal behavior in the context of aging IIoT. The approach leverages multivariate statistical analysis [e.g., principle component analysis (PCA)], alongside the Hotelling's T<sup>2</sup> statistics, and the univariate cumulative sum in order to detect abnormal process events. An innovative feature of the developed approach is the detection of stealth attacks attempting to influence the dataset in each age. The extensive experimental results on a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) model demonstrate its applicability to the IIoT and its superior performance to the recently reported techniques.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2920699","H2020 Societal Challenges(grant numbers:Agreement 814951); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8730334","Anomaly detection systems;Industrial Internet of Things;aging processes;multivariate statistical analysis","Aging;Anomaly detection;Internet of Things;Malware;Security;Monitoring;Industries","computer network security;factory automation;industrial control;Internet of Things;invasive software;principal component analysis;production engineering computing","anomaly detection;Industrial Internet;agile automation;efficient automation;future industrial systems;energy efficiency;smart factories;pervasive adoption;security risks;damaging effects;hackable devices;invasive devices;infamous Stuxnet malware;undisputed effect;disruptive effect;malware-targeting IIoT systems;securing IIoT systems;physical process;aging IIoT;principle component analysis;IIoT physical dimension;IIoT life cycle;Mirai botnet","","7","","40","OAPA","4 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Detecting intrusion is a prevalent area of study for numerous years, and several intrusion detection systems have been suggested in the literature for cyber-physical systems and industrial control system (ICS). In recent years, the viruses seismic net, duqu, and flame against ICS attacks have caused tremendous damage to nuclear facilities and critical infrastructure in some countries. These intensified attacks have sounded the alarm for the security of the ICS in many countries. The challenge in constructing an intrusion detection framework is to deal with unbalanced intrusion datasets, i.e. when one class is signified by a lesser amount of instances (minority class). To this end, we outline an approach to deal with this issue and propose an anomaly detection method for the ICS. Our proposed approach uses a hybrid model that takes advantage of the anticipated and consistent nature of communication patterns that occur among ground devices in ICS setups. First, we applied some preprocessing techniques to standardize and scale the data. Second, the dimensionality reduction algorithms are applied to improve the process of anomaly detection. Third, we employed an edited nearest-neighbor rule algorithm to balance the dataset. Fourth, by using the Bloom filter, a signature database is created by noting the system for a specific period lacking the occurrence of abnormalities. Finally, to detect new attacks, we combined our package contents-level detection with another instance-based learner to make a hybrid method for anomaly detection. The experimental results with a real large-scale dataset generated from a gas pipeline SCADA system show that the proposed approach HML-IDS outperforms the benchmark models with an accuracy rate of 97%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2925838","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1433116); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:NP2017208); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8751972","Bloom filters;zero-day attacks;intrusion detection;SCADA;industrial control systems","Integrated circuits;Intrusion detection;SCADA systems;Anomaly detection;Process control;Protocols","control engineering computing;cyber-physical systems;data reduction;data structures;industrial control;nearest neighbour methods;production engineering computing;SCADA systems;security of data","hybrid-multilevel anomaly prediction approach;SCADA systems;electricity generation;dispersal networks;chemical processing plants;gas distribution;intrusion detection systems;cyber-physical systems;industrial control system;ICS attacks;nuclear facilities;critical infrastructure;intensified attacks;intrusion detection framework;unbalanced intrusion datasets;anomaly detection method;nearest-neighbor rule algorithm;package contents-level detection;large-scale dataset;HML-IDS;gas pipeline SCADA system;supervisory control and data acquisition systems;dimensionality reduction algorithms;Bloom filter;signature database;instance-based learner","","11","","62","CCBY","1 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Covid-19 disease has accelerated this process. Cyber criminals' interest has shifted in a real to virtual life as well. This is because it is easier to commit a crime in cyberspace rather than regular life. Malicious software (malware) is unwanted software which is frequently used by cyber criminals to launch cyber-attacks. Malware variants are continuing to evolve by using advanced obfuscation and packing techniques. These concealing techniques make malware detection and classification significantly challenging. Novel methods which are quite different from traditional methods must be used to effectively combat with new malware variants. Traditional artificial intelligence (AI) specifically machine learning (ML) algorithms are no longer effective in detecting all new and complex malware variants. Deep learning (DL) approach which is quite different from traditional ML algorithms can be a promising solution to the problem of detecting all variants of malware. In this study, a novel deep-learning-based architecture is proposed which can classify malware variants based on a hybrid model. The main contribution of the study is to propose a new hybrid architecture which integrates two wide-ranging pre-trained network models in an optimized manner. This architecture consists of four main stages, namely: data acquisition, the design of deep neural network architecture, training of the proposed deep neural network architecture, and evaluation of the trained deep neural network. The proposed method tested on Malimg, Microsoft BIG 2015, and Malevis datasets. The experimental results show that the suggested method can effectively classify malware with high accuracy which outperforms the state of the art methods in the literature. When proposed method tested on Malimg dataset, 97.78% accuracy is obtained which is outperformed most of the ML-based malware detection method.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3089586","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9455368","Malware;malware classification;malware detection;malware variants;deep neural networks;transfer learning;deep learning","Malware;Feature extraction;Deep learning;Computer architecture;Cloud computing;Classification algorithms;Static analysis","data acquisition;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;invasive software;neural net architecture;pattern classification","cyber-attacks;advanced obfuscation;packing techniques;traditional artificial intelligence;new malware variants;complex malware variants;deep learning approach;traditional ML algorithms;deep-learning-based architecture;pre-trained network models;deep neural network architecture;trained deep neural network;ML-based malware detection method;malware classification framework;deep learning algorithms;computer systems transfer human life;virtual environments;covid-19 disease;cyber criminals;virtual life;regular life;malicious software","","","","63","CCBY","15 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The online abnormal threat detection system based on deep learning is likely to be attacked by poisoning due to the need for continuous data collection and training. We propose a poisoning attack method using adversarial samples to resist the anomaly detection system based on an unsupervised deep neural network, which can destroy the neural network with as few samples as possible. We verified the effectiveness of poisoning attacks on the network security data set of los alamos national laboratory and further demonstrated its generality on other abnormal detection data set.","2324-9013","978-1-6654-0392-4","10.1109/TrustCom50675.2020.00231","Strategic Priority Research Program of CAS(grant numbers:XDC02010300); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9343232","anomaly detection;unsupervised recurrent neural network;adversarial sample;poisoning attack","Deep learning;Training;Recurrent neural networks;Resists;Security;Reliability;Anomaly detection","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;security of data","poisoning attacks;RNN-based cyber anomaly detection;increasingly complex Internet environment;traditional intrusion detection system;anomaly detection technology;artificial intelligence technology;development opportunities;anomaly detection system;deep learning;poisoned samples;data set;online abnormal threat detection system;continuous data collection;poisoning attack method;unsupervised deep neural network;network security data;abnormal detection data","","","","37","","9 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, our study involves a random forest classifier that utilizes network flows to distinguish between botnet and benign samples. Our results, derived from experiments performed on a public real dataset of labelled network flows, show that attackers can easily evade such defensive mechanisms by applying slight and targeted modifications to the network activity generated by their controlled bots.

As a main standard for in-vehicle network, Controller Area Network (CAN) does not have any built-in security mechanisms to guarantee a secure communication. This increases risks of denial of service, remote control attacks by an attacker, posing serious threats to underlying vehicles, property and human lives. As a result, it is urgent to develop an effective in-vehicle network intrusion detection system (IDS) for better security. In this paper, we propose a Feature-based Sliding Window (FSW) to extract the feature of CAN Data Field and CAN IDs. Then we construct a convolutional encoder network (CEN) to detect network intrusion of CAN networks. The proposed FSW-CEN method is evaluated on real-world datasets.

Many control applications require hard real-time channels, where the delay and jitter are in the levels of milliseconds or less. To the best of our knowledge, no encryption algorithm is fast enough for hard real-time channels of existing industrial fieldbuses and, therefore, made mission-critical applications vulnerable to cyberattacks, e.g., delay and data injection attacks. In this article, we propose a novel recursive watermark (RWM) algorithm for hard real-time control system data integrity validation. Using a watermark key, a transmitter applies watermark noise to hard real-time signals and sends through the unencrypted hard real-time channel. The same key is transferred to the receiver by the encrypted nonreal-time channel. With the same key, the receiver can detect if the data have been modified by the attackers and take action to prevent catastrophic damages. We provide analysis and methods to design proper watermark keys to ensure reliable attack detection. We use a ship propulsion control system for the simulation-based case study, where our algorithm smoothly shuts down the system after attacks. We also evaluated the algorithm speed on a Siemens S7-1500 programmable logic controller (PLC). This hardware experiment demonstrated that the RWM algorithm takes about 2.8 μs to add or validate the watermark noise on one sample data point. As a comparison, common cryptic hashing algorithms can hardly process a small data set under 100 ms. The proposed RWM is about 32 to 1375 times faster than the standard approaches.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2019.2963257","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8984338","Cyber resilience;cyber security;delay attack;industrial control system (ICSs);Internet of Things (IoT);watermark","Real-time systems;Delays;Watermarking;Jitter;Integrated circuits;Data integrity;Control systems","control engineering computing;control system security;cryptography;field buses;industrial control;programmable controllers;watermarking","reliable attack detection;ship propulsion control system;Siemens S7-1500 programmable logic controller;RWM algorithm;watermark noise;common cryptic hashing algorithms;recursive watermark method;industrial control systems;ship automation;energy automation systems;control applications;encryption algorithm;industrial fieldbuses;watermark key;nonreal-time channel;realtime control system data integrity validation;recursive watermark algorithm;cyber-resilience enhancement;time 2.8 mus;time 100.0 ms","","2","","45","IEEE","5 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The freely available Tor and the SOCKS proxy services have been popular tools that provide circuit-based anonymous connections to network users. However, recent security breaches reveal that SSH and HTTPS have been used to launch attacks by malicious users by taking advantage of these services to hide their identities. This paper investigates strategies to detect SSH and HTTPS connections via the circuit-based anonymity networks, to help servers and websites defend against anonymous intruders. We evaluate our approaches with SSH and HTTPS connections and show that they achieve high performance for both applications. Our detection algorithms are based on the extra latency delays introduced by the presence of the anonymity networks. Since the latency disparity is sensitive to the location of the anonymity network, our algorithms must be evaluated in the most challenging scenarios. The detection rates for all four combinations of SSH/HTTPS applications via Tor/SOCKS networks were very high, with a low false-positive rate. To demonstrate the robustness of our approach in the Tor case, we tested our method in multiple Tor circuit node selection strategies.

In this paper, we present Camouflage learning, a distributed machine learning scheme that obscures the trained model via probabilistic collaboration using physical-layer computation offloading and demonstrate the feasibility of the approach on backscatter communication prototypes and in comparison with Federated learning. We show that Camouflage learning is more energy efficient than traditional schemes and that it requires less communication overhead while reducing the computation load through physical-layer computation offloading. The scheme is synchronization-agnostic and thus appropriate for sharply constrained, synchronization-incapable devices. We demonstrate model training and inference on four distinct datasets and investigate the performance of the scheme with respect to communication range, impact of challenging communication environments, power consumption, and the backscatter hardware prototype.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2021.3092271","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9464748","Distributed machine learning;Data obfuscation;Backscatter;Computation offloading;Ambient Intelligence","Sensors;Ambient intelligence;Backscatter;Distributed databases;Protocols;Collaboration;Machine learning","","","","","","","IEEE","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

These types of channels utilize inter-arrival times to steal sensitive data from the targeted networks. CTC detection relies increasingly on machine learning techniques, which utilize statistical-based metrics to separate malicious (covert) traffic flows from the legitimate (overt) ones. However, given the efforts of cyber attacks to evade detection and the growing column of CTC, covert channels detection needs to improve in both performance and precision to detect and prevent CTCs and mitigate the reduction of the quality of service caused by the detection process. In this article, we present an innovative image-based solution for fully automated CTC detection and localization. Our approach is based on the observation that the covert channels generate traffic that can be converted to colored images. Leveraging this observation, our solution is designed to automatically detect and locate the malicious part (i.e., set of packets) within a traffic flow. By locating the covert parts within traffic flows, our approach reduces the drop of the quality of service caused by blocking the entire traffic flows in which covert channels are detected. We first convert traffic flows into colored images, and then we extract image-based features for detection covert traffic. We train a classifier using these features on a large data set of covert and overt traffic. This approach demonstrates a remarkable performance achieving a detection accuracy of 95.83% for cautious CTCs and a covert traffic accuracy of 97.83% for 8 bit covert messages, which is way beyond what the popular statistical-based solutions can achieve.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3046234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9301285","Covert timing channels;detection;entropy;image processing;machine learning","Feature extraction;Timing;Machine learning;Entropy;Quality of service;Decision trees;Machine learning algorithms","computer network security;image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);statistical analysis;telecommunication channels;telecommunication traffic","covert traffic accuracy;8 bit covert messages;statistical-based solutions;detection accuracy;data set;detection covert traffic;image-based features;entire traffic flows;covert parts;traffic flow;colored images;fully automated CTC detection;innovative image-based solution;detection process;quality of service;covert channels detection;separate malicious traffic;machine learning techniques;targeted networks;sensitive data;inter-arrival times;imminent network security risk;cyber attacks;data exfiltration;image processing;covert timing channels;automatic detection;word length 8.0 bit","","1","","47","CCBY","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result, it is easy for attackers to launch attacks at the CAN bus network system. Attackers can compromise the CAN bus system in several ways: denial of service, fuzzing, spoofing, etc. It is imperative to devise methodologies to protect modern cars against the aforementioned attacks. In this paper, we propose a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect and mitigate the CAN bus network attacks. We first inject attacks at the CAN bus system in a car that we have at our disposal to generate the attack dataset, which we use to test and train our model.

In this paper, we present a novel proactive-adaptive defense technique that turns end-hosts into untraceable moving targets, and establishes dynamics into static systems by monitoring the adversarial behavior and reconfiguring the addresses of network hosts adaptively. This adaptability is achieved by discovering hazardous network ranges and addresses and evacuating network hosts from them quickly. Our approach maximizes adaptability by (1) using fast and accurate hypothesis testing for characterization of adversarial behavior, and (2) achieving a very fast IP randomization (i.e., update) rate through separating randomization from end-hosts and managing it via network appliances. The architecture and protocols of our approach can be transparently deployed on legacy networks, as well as software-defined networks. Our extensive analysis and evaluation show that by adaptive distortion of adversarial reconnaissance, our approach slows down the attack and increases its detectability, thus significantly raising the bar against stealthy scanning, major classes of evasive scanning and worm propagation, as well as targeted (hacking) attacks.","0743-166X","978-1-4799-8381-0","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218443","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218443","","IP networks;Probes;Reconnaissance;Logic gates;Protocols;Servers;Conferences","computer network security;IP networks;software defined networking","adversary-aware IP address randomization;proactive agility;sophisticated attackers;network hosts;software-defined networks","","19","","18","","24 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these systems depend on the availability of the systems normal traffic pattern profile. But the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic pattern can change and shift over a period of time due to changes in operational or user activity at the networked site or even system updates. The changes in normal traffic patterns over time lead to concept drift. Some changes can be temporal, cyclical and can be short-lived or they can last for longer periods of time. Depending on a number of factors the speed at which the change in traffic patterns occurs can also be variable, ranging from near instantaneous to the change occurring over the span of numerous months. These changes in traffic patterns are a cause of concern for IDSs as they can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates, thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to improve the reliability of the IDS, there is a need for an automated mechanism to detect valid traffic changes and avoid inappropriate ad hoc responses. ROC curves have historically been used to evaluate the accuracy of IDSs. ROC curves generated using fixed, time-invariant classification thresholds do not characterize the best accuracy that an IDS can achieve in presence of concept-drifting network traffic. In this paper, we present a integrated supervised machine learning and control theoretic model for detecting concept drift in network traffic patterns. The model comprises of a online support vector machine based classifier(incremental anomaly based detection), a Kullback - Leibler divergence based relative entropy measurement scheme(quantifying concept drift) and feedback control engine(adapting ROC thresholding). In our proposed system, any intrusion activity will cause significant variations, thereby causing a large error, while a minor aberration in the variations (concept drift) will not be immediately reported as alert.","","978-1-4577-1376-7","10.1109/THS.2011.6107850","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6107850","Anomaly Based Intrusion Detection Systems;Support Vector Machine;Concept Drift","Adaptation models;Support vector machines;Entropy;Accuracy;Engines;Training;Feedback control","data mining;feedback;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","control theoretic model;concept-drifting data stream mining;anomaly-based network intrusion detection systems;network attack;normal traffic pattern profile;user activity;receiver operating characteristic curve;ROC curve;supervised machine learning;concept drift detection;support vector machine based classifier;incremental anomaly based detection;Kullback-Leibler divergence;entropy measurement scheme;feedback control engine;adapting ROC thresholding","","5","","21","","19 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many such patterns have recently been developed. This paper adds the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to the catalog. The essence of a GA is to express the problem to be optimized in terms of a ""fitness function"" that evaluates how well candidates optimize the solution. In natural evolution fitness is an organism's ability to survive and reproduce. Computing applications abstract fitness to match the problem at hand, such as an Intrusion Detection System attempting to correlate seemingly unrelated events that collectively constitute a threat Reviewed first are the pattern project and the general nature of the GA. A reusable generic pattern description is developed. Howthe pattern conforms to the SAREPH characteristics is shown.

The data sample is generated to supplement the small data set sample, which is helpful to improve the accuracy of network intrusion detection. Firstly, the non-numerical data in the original data set is converted into numerical data by one-hot coding, and reconstructed them into two-dimensional data. Secondly, this paper proposes an S-DCGAN algorithm to generate data. Initially, we improve the network structure of deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN). S_ReLU function is used instead of the ReLU function as the activation function after each convolutional layer of the adversarial network, which makes the quality of the generated data better and the effect of the generated data more stable. Furthermore, we improve the loss function of generation model and discriminant model of DCGAN. A simplified total variation loss function is added to the loss function of the generated model to reduce the noise of the generated data. The gradient penalty term is added to the loss function of the discriminant model to alleviate the problem of gradient explosion or gradient disappearance and improve the stability of network training.

CVAE introduces the labels of traffic packets into a latent space in order to better learn the changes of input samples and distinguish the data characteristics of each class.

In order to protect computer systems and the Internet from the malware, the malware needs to be detected before it affects a large number of systems. Recently, there have been made several studies on malware detection approaches. However, the detection of malware still remains problematic. Signature-based and heuristic-based detection approaches are fast and efficient to detect known malware, but especially signature-based detection approach has failed to detect unknown malware. On the other hand, behavior-based, model checking-based, and cloud-based approaches perform well for unknown and complicated malware; and deep learning-based, mobile devices-based, and IoT-based approaches also emerge to detect some portion of known and unknown malware. However, no approach can detect all malware in the wild. This shows that to build an effective method to detect malware is a very challenging task, and there is a huge gap for new studies and methods. This paper presents a detailed review on malware detection approaches and recent detection methods which use these approaches. Paper goal is to help researchers to have a general idea of the malware detection approaches, pros and cons of each detection approach, and methods that are used in these approaches.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2963724","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8949524","Cyber security;malware classification;malware detection approaches;malware features","Computer viruses;Feature extraction;Encryption;Internet","cloud computing;digital signatures;formal verification;Internet;Internet of Things;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;neural nets","malware detection;malicious software;heuristic-based detection;signature-based detection;cloud-based approaches;IoT-based approach;obfuscation techniques;deep learning-based approach;mobile devices-based approach;behavior-based approach;model checking-based approach","","16","","111","CCBY","3 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, computation is divided into two phases: online (at the sensor) and offline (at a more powerful central node). Moreover, public keys are generated based on the identities to reduce communication overhead.

This would be very convenient for allowing network access only to those within a physical boundary. However, an attacker not within the authentication range may deceive the AP into authenticating its proximity by eavesdropping with higher receiver gain and increasing its transmit power. This can be done easily using an amplifier or a directional antenna. To address this challenge, we propose `Fixed MCS SNR (FMS)' filtering scheme based on the intuition that high MCS requires high SNR, and amplifying the received signal strength does not necessarily improve SNR. We experimentally show that this is true in reality, and our real-world evaluation in various environments (14 locations) shows that FMS scheme prevents `amplifier attacks' in all cases. To further counter the false positives of FMS against `directional antenna attacks' (avg. 35.7%), we also propose `Authentication Motion with Signal strength gap (AMS)' filtering scheme which defends against both attacks in all cases at the cost of requiring the user to make a simple motion. FMS or AMS scheme can be selected according to the application requirement to enhance the security of proximity-based authentication in upcoming IoT.","1976-5541","","10.1109/JCN.2020.000009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9152596","IEEE 802.11n;proximity-based authentication;security;wireless;authentication","Authentication;Signal to noise ratio;Password;Wireless communication;Frequency modulation;Communication system security;Directional antennas","Internet of Things;message authentication;telecommunication security","FMS-AMS;proximity-based authentication;wireless access points;authentication range;network access;Fixed MCS SNR filtering scheme;FMS scheme;directional antenna attacks;Authentication Motion with Signal strength gap filtering scheme;internet of things","","5","","","","29 Jul 2020","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

This paper presents a deep learning-based spoofing attack to generate synthetic wireless signals that cannot be statistically distinguished from intended transmissions. The adversary is modeled as a pair of a transmitter and a receiver that build the generator and discriminator of the generative adversarial network, respectively, by playing a minimax game over the air. The adversary transmitter trains a deep neural network to generate the best spoofing signals and fool the best defense trained as another deep neural network at the adversary receiver. Each node (defender or adversary) may have multiple transmitter or receiver antennas. Signals are spoofed by jointly capturing waveform, channel, and radio hardware effects that are inherent to wireless signals under attack. Compared with spoofing attacks using random or replayed signals, the proposed attack increases the probability of misclassifying spoofing signals as intended signals for different network topology and mobility patterns. The adversary transmitter can increase the spoofing attack success by using multiple antennas, while the attack success decreases when the defender receiver uses multiple antennas. For practical deployment, the attack implementation on embedded platforms demonstrates the low latency of generating or classifying spoofing signals.","2332-7731","","10.1109/TCCN.2020.3010330","U.S. Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-17-C-0090); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9144305","Adversarial machine learning;deep learning;generative adversarial network (GAN);spoofing attack","Wireless communication;Gallium nitride;Machine learning;Receivers;Radio transmitters;Wireless sensor networks;Communication system security","antenna arrays;cryptography;deep learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;probability;radio receivers;radio transmitters;receiving antennas;signal classification;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","generative adversarial network;deep adversarial learning;wireless signal spoofing;physical-layer signal authentication;deep learning-based;synthetic wireless signals;adversary transmitter;deep neural network;adversary receiver;multiple transmitter;receiver antennas;random replayed signals;intended signals;different network topology;mobility patterns;spoofing attack success;multiple antennas;defender receiver;spoofing signals","","2","","60","IEEE","20 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, there is a need for an intelligent system that copes with this issue. This paper proposes a machine learning (ML) based framework to counter rapid evolution of mobile threats. This model is based on flow-based features, that will work on the network side. This model is designed with adversarial input in mind. The model uses 40 time-based network flow features, extracted from the real-time traffic of malicious and benign applications. The proposed model not only to detects the known and unknown mobile threats but also deals with the changing behavior of the attackers by triggering the retraining phase. The proposed framework can be used by the mobile operators to protect their subscribers.

People, including those with speech and hearing disabilities, are starting to use text messages in place of voice 9-1-1 calls to call for help during emergencies and many 9-1-1 centers are starting to support text messaging. Since text messages take less bandwidth, it is more likely to be available in a major disaster than voice calls. Text messages are also useful in emergency situation such as a child hiding in a closet during a home invasion. On the other hand, text message system is also subject to abuse by hackers. In a recent attack, a teenager was able to send voice calls from a large number of smartphones to 9-1-1 call centers. That same Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attack can happen to text messages. While it does not fall under the policy of the call centers to filter out the incoming messages, it would be useful to do some preliminary analyses of the text messages and based on the result of those analyses determine the priority order for processing thereby helping human operators to efficiently manage the messages. In this work, we design and implement several new Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the contents of the incoming text messages to an emergency call center to provide insights about potential spam or DDoS attacks to 9-1-1 centers. Our preliminary results show that the task of automatically analyzing the text to determine if a text is part of an attack can be done with reasonable accuracy.","","978-1-5386-3443-1","10.1109/THS.2018.8574125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8574125","","Engines;Databases;Text analysis;Computer crime;Natural language processing;Task analysis;Electronic messaging","computer network security;electronic messaging;emergency services;mobile computing;natural language processing","9-1-1 emergency systems;text messaging;text message system;potential spam;emergency call center;natural language processing;distributed denial of services attack;cellphone;text DDoS;content-based defense","","","","13","","13 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, effective forecasting can be challenging in noisy contexts devoid of time series data encompassing stationarity, cyclicality, completeness, and non-sparseness. Cyber-security is a good example of such context. In organizational security settings, predicting time series related to emerging attacks could enhance cyber threat intelligence, resulting in timely and actionable insights at the operational, tactical, and strategic levels. In order to explore this gap, we propose a deep generative model-based framework for time series forecasting in noisy data environments. The proposed framework incorporates a novel ensembling strategy where generative adversarial networks and recurrent variational autoencoders are leveraged in unison with base predictors for enhanced regularization of time series predictive models. The framework is extensible, supporting different model combinations and analytical or iterative model fusion strategies. Using a test bed encompassing 10 years of weekly phishing attack volume data from 5 organizations in the technology, financial services, and social networking sectors, we show that the framework can boost predictive power for various standard time series models. Additional results reveal that the framework outperforms generative data augmentation approaches designed to enrich the input time series data matrices. Collectively, our findings suggest that utilizing generative models in more robust end-to-end setup can improve prediction in cyber threat intelligence contexts, as well as related problems involving challenging time series data.","2375-9259","978-1-7281-9012-9","10.1109/ICDMW51313.2020.00073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9346362","Time series modeling;generative adversarial networks;variational autoencoders;phishing;cyber threat intelligence;cybersecurity;deep learning;predictive analytics","Analytical models;Phishing;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Data models;Noise measurement;Forecasting","computer crime;deep learning (artificial intelligence);forecasting theory;recurrent neural nets;time series","deep generative models;boost forecasting;phishing prediction case study;time series predictions;application domains;effective forecasting;noisy contexts;time series data;nonsparseness;cyber-security;organizational security settings;emerging attacks;timely insights;actionable insights;operational levels;tactical levels;strategic levels;deep generative model-based framework;time series forecasting;noisy data environments;generative adversarial networks;recurrent variational autoencoders;base predictors;enhanced regularization;time series predictive models;different model combinations;analytical model fusion strategies;iterative model fusion strategies;weekly phishing attack volume data;predictive power;standard time series models;generative data augmentation;input time series data matrices;cyber threat intelligence contexts;challenging time series data;generative models;time 10.0 year","","1","","39","","16 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Security practitioners need IoT network traffic data to develop and assess network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Emulating realistic network traffic will avoid the costly physical deployment of thousands of smart devices. From an attacker's perspective, generating network traffic that mimics the legitimate behavior of a device can be useful to evade NIDS. As network traffic data consist of sequences of packets, the problem is similar to the generation of sequences of categorical data, like word by word text generation. Many solutions in the field of natural language processing have been proposed to adapt a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate sequences of categorical data. In this paper, we propose to combine an autoencoder with a GAN to generate sequences of packet sizes that correspond to bidirectional flows. First, the autoencoder is trained to learn a latent representation of the real sequences of packet sizes. A GAN is then trained on the latent space, to learn to generate latent vectors that can be decoded into realistic sequences. For experimental purposes, bidirectional flows produced by a Google Home Mini are used, and the autoencoder is combined with a Wassertein GAN. Comparison of different network characteristics shows that our proposed approach is able to generate sequences of packet sizes that behave closely to real bidirectional flows. We also show that the synthetic bidirectional flows are close enough to the real ones that they can fool anomaly detectors into labeling them as legitimate.","2473-3105","978-1-7281-8003-8","10.1109/PRDC50213.2020.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9320384","Deep Learning;Generative Adversarial Network;Autoencoder;Network Security;Internet of Things","Gallium nitride;IP networks;Generative adversarial networks;Internet of Things;Protocols;Security;MIMICs","computer network security;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;telecommunication traffic","IoT network traffic data;network-based intrusion detection systems;NIDS;realistic network traffic;categorical data;word text generation;GAN;autoencoder;bidirectional flows;realistic sequences;network characteristics;generative deep learning;Internet of Things network traffic generation;generative adversarial network","","","","32","","14 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At present, generating adversarial patches based on Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) has been an emerging study. However, existing attack strategies are still far from producing local adversarial patches with strong attack power, ignoring the attacked network's perceived sensitivity to the adversarial patches. This paper studies the security threat of adversarial patches to classifiers; adding an adversarial patch to the data can mislead the classifier into incorrect results. Considering the attention to aggression and reality, we propose the data-driven MultiD-WGAN, which can simultaneously enhance adversarial patches' attack power and authenticity through multi-discriminators. The experiments confirm that our datadriven MultiD-WGAN dramatically reduces the recall of seven classifiers attacked on four datasets. The attack of data-driven MultiD-WGAN on 25/28 groups of experiments leads to a decreased recall rate, which is better than the conventional GANs. Finally, we have proved a positive correlation between attack intensity and attack ability, both theoretically and experimentally.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401525","National Key Research and Development Program of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401525","Generative Adversarial Nets;Attack Power;Adversarial Patches","Sensitivity;Machine learning algorithms;Correlation;Training data;Machine learning;Security;Gallium nitride","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;security of data","Generative Adversarial Nets;training data;machine learning algorithms;generating adversarial patches;attack intensity;datadriven MultiD-WGAN;data-driven MultiD-WGAN;security threat;adversarial patch;attacked network;strong attack power;local adversarial patches","","","","17","","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we investigate a new type of DoS attack, called hatchetman attack, in promptly emerging RPL-based LLNs. In hatchetman attack, the malicious node manipulates the source route header of the received packets, and then generates and sends a large number of invalid packets with error route to legitimate nodes, which cause the legitimate nodes to drop the received packets and reply an excessive number of Error messages back to the DODAG root. As a result, a great number of packets are dropped by legitimate nodes and excessive Error messages exhaust the communication bandwidth and node energy, which lead to a denial of service in RPL-based LLNs. We conduct extensive simulation experiments for performance evaluation of hatchetman attack and comparison with jamming attack and original RPL without adversary. The simulation results indicate that the hatchetman attack is an extremely severe attack in RPL-based LLNs.","","978-1-5386-5850-5","10.1109/CSCloud/EdgeCom.2018.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8421845","Hatchetman attack;denial-of-service (DoS) attack;RPL;low power and lossy networks","Routing protocols;Routing;Denial-of-service attack;Cloud computing","computer network security;Internet;Internet of Things;jamming;routing protocols","ubiquitous communication infrastructure;Internet-of-Things applications;resources-constrained devices;network protocols;DoS attack;source route header;received packets;legitimate nodes;communication bandwidth;node energy;extremely severe attack;low power and lossy networks;routing protocol;Denial-of-Service attack;RPL-based LLN;hatchetman attack","","9","","26","","30 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these systems consist of a number of drawbacks. As there is a human component, there is a possibility of identification of false positives as true threat alerts. This will impact inversely towards the overall system. Currently there exists some automated SOCs as well, however their cost is considerably high for most small and medium scale companies. That is why we propose AutoSOC, a fully automated security operations center platform except for the Forensic investigation system, which requires a ticket to be generated with the approval of the user. This low budget enterprise solution comprises of an Intelligent Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IIDPS), a Security Incident and Event Management System (SIEM), a Malware Analysis System and a Simple Forensic Investigation System. The Intelligent IIDPS contains an Intelligent Intrusion Detection System (IIDS) and an Intelligent Intrusion Prevention System (IIPS). IIDS is an alert system, which comprises components that notify and communicate in between integrated components when an attack or a breach occurs. The IIPS will understand the behavior of applications, and protocols are supposed to be according to their published standards. The SIEM is responsible for analyzing security event data, and it collects logs, stores, analyzes and reports on log data for incident response, forensics and regulatory compliance. The malware analysis process runs parallel to a forensic toolkit in order to accurately predict possible root causes for a certain incident. The forensic toolkit targets on the key components of analysis including processes running, packets captured etc. Therefore, the suggested solution will be able to reduce the cost of security implementations, increase the efficiency and accuracy of analysis results by eliminating false positives or the reporting of incorrect vulnerabilities by learning about the SOC network and environment.","","978-1-5386-2425-8","10.1109/NITC.2017.8285644","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8285644","SOC;IDS;IPS;SIEM;Forensics","Forensics;Malware;IP networks;Monitoring;Intrusion detection;Organizations","invasive software;organisational aspects;small-to-medium enterprises","AutoSOC;low budget flexible security operations platform;enterprises;organizations;hybrid methodology;Security operations execution;false positives;threat alerts;automated SOCs;small scale companies;medium scale companies;fully automated security operations center platform;low budget enterprise solution;Security Incident;SIEM;Malware Analysis System;Simple Forensic Investigation System;Intelligent IIDPS;Intelligent Intrusion Detection System;IIDS;Intelligent Intrusion Prevention System;IIPS;alert system;integrated components;security event data;incident response;forensics;malware analysis process;forensic toolkit targets;security implementations;Security Operations Center;Security Incident and Event Management System","","4","","23","","8 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the remarkable progress of MCPS technologies in recent years, there is a need to advance the security measures to efficiently detect attacks in this domain. Research on intrusion detection for medical cyber physical systems is still in its infancy. For an efficient intrusion detection system (IDS), it is important to address the problem of feature selection to remove redundant, irrelevant and noisy features. Feature selection is even more relevant to address in MCPS as the use of entire feature space places unnecessary burden on resource constrained systems in this domain. Also since real-time detection of attacks is critical in healthcare systems, the amount of data processed by IDS must be reduced to achieve low detection latency. In this paper, we investigate the problem of feature selection in medical cyber physical systems.

The firmest barriers to apply MAC to defeat malware programs are the incompatible and unusable problems in existing MAC systems. To address these issues, we manually analyze 2,600 malware samples one by one and two types of MAC enforced operating systems, and then design a novel MAC enforcement approach, named Tracer, which incorporates intrusion detection and tracing in a commercial operating system. The approach conceptually consists of three actions: detecting, tracing, and restricting suspected intruders. One novelty is that it leverages light-weight intrusion detection and tracing techniques to automate security label configuration that is widely acknowledged as a tough issue when applying a MAC system in practice. The other is that, rather than restricting information flow as a traditional MAC does, it traces intruders and restricts only their critical malware behaviors, where intruders represent processes and executables that are potential agents of a remote attacker. Our prototyping and experiments on Windows show that Tracer can effectively defeat all malware samples tested via blocking malware behaviors while not causing a significant compatibility problem.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2012.36","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6175909","Access controls;operating system;invasive software;OS-level information flow.","Malware;Protocols;Operating systems;Access control;Usability","authorisation;invasive software;operating systems (computers)","mandatory access control enforcement;commodity OS;commercial operating system;malware programs;MAC systems;MAC enforcement approach;Tracer;intrusion detection;suspected intruder detection;suspected intruder tracing;suspected intruder restricting;security label configuration;critical malware behavior blocking;remote attacker;Windows","","6","","31","","3 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Behind the wheels of these mobile robots lies machine learning (ML) to automate mundane driving tasks and make decisions from situational awareness. Attacking ML, the brain of driverless cars, can cause catastrophes. This paper proposes a novel approach to attack CAV by fooling its ML model. Using adversarial examples in CAVs, the work demonstrates how adversarial machine learning can generate attacks hardly detectable by current ML classifiers for CAV misbehavior detection. First, adversarial datasets are generated by a traditional attack engine, which CAV misbehavior detection ML models can easily detect. Building attack ML model takes two phases: training and testing. Using supervised learning, Phase I trains the model on the time-series data, converted from the adversarial datasets. Phase II tests the model, which leads, for the next round of model improvement. The initial round deploys K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, respectively. The next round, guided by deep learning (DL) models, uses Logistic Regression (LG) of neural network and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) of recurrent neural network. The results, in precision-recall (PR) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, validate the effectiveness of the proposed adversarial ML models. This work reveals the vulnerability in ML. At the same time, it shows the promise to protect critical infrastructure by studying the opponent strategies. Future work includes retraining the adversarial ML models with real-world datasets from pilot CAV sites.","","978-1-7281-5092-5","10.1109/HST47167.2019.9032989","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9032989","Artificial intelligence (AI);machine learning (ML);critical infrastructure protection;securing connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV);threat detection;supervised learning;deep learning (DL);long-short-term-memory (LSTM);adversarial machine learning","Machine learning;Autonomous vehicles;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Computational modeling;Data models;Autonomous automobiles;Training","automobiles;control engineering computing;mobile robots;nearest neighbour methods;pattern classification;random forests;recurrent neural nets;regression analysis;road safety;supervised learning;time series;traffic engineering computing","deep learning models;adversarial ML models;pilot CAV sites;connected and autonomous vehicles;driverless cars;adversarial machine learning;ML classifiers;CAV misbehavior detection ML models;supervised learning;attack ML model;K-nearest neighbor;random forest;logistic regression;recurrent neural network;long short-term memory;mobile robots;situational awareness;time-series data","","5","","14","","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the recent emergence of cloud computing and big data analytics, supervised machine learning is also being used to detect deviations of the network traffic patterns from already-known normal patterns. Subsequently, these anomalies are analyzed by human experts to differentiate legitimate anomalies, also known as true positives, from enormous false anomalies and reconfigure the machine learning system accordingly. Using machine learning for cyber security is relatively a difficult topic compared to other application domains primarily because of the dynamically fast changing threat landscape which is also extremely complex. Our main claim is that the proposed methodology significantly improves the classification performance of neural networks by detecting obfuscated malicious samples that masquerade the behavior of normal samples and thus are indistinguishable on Platonic Euclidean feature space. It is achieved by transforming a traditional single-scale (Euclidean scale) based error curve to information fractal dimension based multiscale error curve and subsequent design changes in the backpropagation algorithm. The performance comparison is provided by incorporating our proposed methodology in a fundamental gradient descent based neural network and shows promising results. Our claims are supported by experimental results and the subsequent analyses.","","978-1-5386-0771-8","10.1109/ICCI-CC.2017.8109765","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8109765","Machine learning;Artificial Neural Network;Classification;Cyber threats;Cyber security;Complexity;Fractal;Gradient Descent;Backpropagation;Multiscale;Advanced indistinguishable threats;Obfuscated cyber threats;Cognitive cyber security;Cognitive Intelligence;Dimensionality","Fractals;Computer security;Artificial neural networks;Learning (artificial intelligence);Internet;Art","backpropagation;cloud computing;firewalls;gradient methods;invasive software;neural nets;telecommunication traffic","signature based techniques;raw packet captures;firewall logs;cloud computing;big data analytics;supervised machine learning;network traffic patterns;legitimate anomalies;cyber security;Platonic Euclidean feature space;single-scale based error curve;information fractal dimension;network intrusion detection systems;fractal based cognitive neural network;obfuscated-indistinguishable Internet threat detection;backpropagation algorithm;gradient descent based neural network","","1","","75","","16 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, it is imperative to use cyber threat ontology (CTO) concepts to extract relevant attack instances in CSC security for knowledge representation. This paper explores the challenges of CTO and adversarial machine learning (AML) attacks for threat prediction to improve cybersecurity. The novelty contributions are threefold. First, CTO concepts are considered for semantic mapping and definition of relationships for explicit knowledge of threat indicators. Secondly, AML techniques are deployed maliciously to manipulate algorithms during training and testing to predict false classifications models. Finally, we discuss the performance analysis of the classification models and how CTO provides automated means. The result shows that analysis of AML attacks and CTO concepts could be used for validating a mediated schema for specific vulnerabilities.","","978-1-6654-2567-4","10.1109/ICCMA53594.2021.00020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9565191","Adversarial Machine Learning;Cyber Threat Ontology;Threat Intelligence;Threat Prediction;Cybersecurity","Training;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Semantics;Ontologies;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms","","","","","","27","","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Today, the importance of this topic is even higher, since the network traffic is growing and there is a need to have smart algorithms, which can automatically adapt to new network conditions, detect threats and recognize the type of the possible network attack. Nowadays, there are a lot of different approaches, some of them have reached relatively sufficient accuracy. However, the majority of works are being tested on old datasets, which do not reflect current network conditions and it leads to overfitted results. This is caused by high redundancy of the data and because they fail to reflect the performance of the latest methods in the real-world anomaly detection applications. In this work, we applied a couple of new methods based on convolutional neural networks: U-Net based and Temporal convolutional network based for network attack classification. We trained and evaluated methods on the old dataset KDD99 and the modern large-scale one CSE-CIC-IDS2018. According to results, Temporal convolutional network with LSTM has achieved accuracy 92% and 97% on the KDD99 and the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 respectively, the U-Net model has accuracy 93% and 94% on the KDD99 and the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 respectively. Additionally, we utilized the focal loss function in the Temporal convolutional network with Long Short-Term Memory model, which has positive effect on class imbalance in time-series data. We showed, that the Temporal convolutional network in combination with Long Short-Term Memory network and U-Net model can give higher accuracy compared to other network architectures for network traffic classification. In this work we also proved, that methods trained on the old dataset can easily overfit during training and achieve relatively good results on the testing set, but at the same time, these methods are not so successful on more complex and actual data.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3121998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583228","Convolutional neural network;deep learning;intrusion detection system;multi-class classification;security;imbalanced dataset","Anomaly detection;Task analysis;Training;Intrusion detection;Feature extraction;Data models;Testing","","","","","","51","CCBY","21 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Today's intrusion detection systems check if specific single scalar features exceed a threshold to determine if a specific TCP-based DoS attack is underway. To defeat such systems we demonstrate that an attacker can simply launch a combination of attack threads, each of which on its own does not break a system down but together can be very potent. We demonstrate that such attacks cannot be detected by simple threshold based statistical anomaly detection techniques that are used in today's intrusion detection systems. We argue that an effective way to detect such attacks is by jointly considering multiple features that are affected by such attacks. Based on this, we identify a possible set of such features and design a new detection approach that jointly examines these features with regards to whether each exceeds a high threshold or is below a low threshold. We demonstrate that this approach is extremely effective in detecting stealthy DoS attacks; the true positive rate is close to 100 % and the false positive rate is decreased by about 66 % as compared to traditional detectors.","","978-1-5090-0073-9","10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7357467","","Computer crime;Feature extraction;Servers;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Observers","computer network security;security of data;telecommunication security;transport protocols","TCP;DoS attacks;denial of service attacks;network attacks;intrusion detection systems","","4","","19","","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using this rapidly developing technology to protect computer-based systems from cyber-related attacks can bring many advantages over traditional protection schemes. The protected assets can be any computer-based systems such as cyber-physical systems (CPS), critical systems, desktop and laptop computers, mobile devices, and Internet of Things (IoT). Malicious software (malware) is any software which targets the computer-based system to launch cyber-attacks to threaten the integrity, confidentiality and availability of the data. To detect the massively growing malware attacks surface, we propose an intelligent behavior-based detection system in the cloud environment. The proposed system first creates a malware dataset on different virtual machines which identify distinctive features efficiently. Then, selected features are given to the learning-based and rule-based detection agents to separate malware from benign samples. Totally, 10,000 program samples have been analyzed to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The proposed system can detect both known and unknown malware efficiently with high detection and accuracy rate. Besides, the proposed method results have outperformed the leading methods' results in the literature. Our evaluation results show that the proposed algorithms along with machine learning (ML) classifiers achieve 99.8% detection rate, 0.4% false positive rate, and 99.7% accuracy.

However, due to its distributed and dynamic nature as well as vulnerabilities in virtualization implementation, the cloud environment is prone to various cyber-attacks and security issues related to cloud model. Some of them are inability to access data coming to and from cloud service, theft and misuse of data hosted, no control over sensitive data access, advance threats like malware injection attack, wrapping attacks, virtual machine escape, distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) etc. DDoS is one of the notorious attack. Despite a number of available potential solutions for the detection of DDoS attacks, the increasing frequency and potency of recent attacks and the constantly evolving attack vectors, necessitate the development of improved detection approaches. This article proposes a novel architecture that combines a well posed stacked sparse AutoEncoder (AE) for feature learning with a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for classification of network traffic into benign traffic and DDoS attack traffic. AE and DNN are optimized for detection of DDoS attacks by tuning the parameters using appropriately designed techniques. The improvements suggested in this article lead to low reconstruction error, prevent exploding and vanishing gradients, and lead to smaller network which avoids overfitting. A comparative analysis of the proposed approach with ten state-of-the-art approaches using performance metrics-detection accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score, has been conducted. Experiments have been performed on CICIDS2017 and NSL-KDD standard datasets for validation.

The capability of ANNs to learn patterns from numerous data helps detect attacks on networked systems. Moreover, to effectively monitor a newly emerging networked system consisting of distributed subsystems, such as edge, Internet of Things (IoT), and fog, recent studies have proposed an ANN-based distributed NIDS, where multiple ANNs are deployed to local gateways. To meet the incessant demand for high accuracy, ANN-based NIDSs have become complicated and heavy. With local gateways being small and low-end, such ANNs cannot be executed. Some researchers have proposed optimized algorithms to balance detection accuracy and runtime performance to solve this problem. For example, Kitsune empirically proved its efficiency, but a recent study reveals that Kitsune has limitations. In particular, Kitsune fails at identifying host-oriented attacks, which pretend to be benign during packet delivery but incur malicious behavior on destination devices. Panop is a novel ANN-based NIDS for a distributed network system that aims to detect malicious packets, including host-oriented attacks, while remaining sufficiently lightweight to be executed by low-end devices. Thus, the Panop ANN is designed to comprehensively learn network and device behaviors related to packet transactions in an IoT network. According to the experiments, Panop can detect host-oriented and other attacks with reasonably high accuracy with little degradation in runtime performance compared to the state-of-the-art NIDS for distributed network environments.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3103015","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant; Korea Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:NRF-2020R1A2B5B03095204); Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) Grant; Korea Government (MSIT) (Development on Autonomous Trust Enhancement Technology of IoT Device and Study on Adaptive IoT Security Open Architecture based on Global Standardization [TrusThingz Project]) (Analysis on technique of accessing and acquiring user data in smartphone)(grant numbers:2018-0-00230,2020-0-01840); MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT),Korea, under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program(grant numbers:IITP-2020-2020-0-01602); IITP (Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation); BK21 FOUR program of the Education and Research Program for Future ICT Pioneers, Seoul National University in 2021; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9508433","Anomaly detection;deep learning;Internet of Things;intrusion detection;machine learning;artificial neural networks","Feature extraction;Logic gates;Internet of Things;Performance evaluation;Neural networks;Monitoring;Computational modeling","computer network security;Internet of Things;neural nets","IoT network;artificial neural networks;network intrusion detection systems;security researchers;networked systems;newly emerging networked system;distributed subsystems;multiple ANNs;local gateways;ANN-based NIDSs;detection accuracy;runtime performance;Kitsune;novel ANN-based NIDS;distributed network system;low end devices;Panop ANN;device behaviors;reasonably high accuracy;state-of-the-art NIDS;distributed network environments;mimicry resistant ANN based distributed NIDS;identifying host oriented attacks","","","","25","CCBYNCND","6 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Indeed, as international trade increases, ports face the pressure to improve their infrastructure in order to maintain their operations and respond to market demands. Given such high level of competition, ports ought to leverage their resources efficiently and effectively, which has resulted in increased automation capabilities and the adoption of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). For such reasons, the container terminal sector is increasingly becoming susceptible to various types of debilitating threats. While a plethora of research efforts, from both, the control and cyber perspectives have been dedicated to tackling the security of CPS in such sectors, there still exists a significant gap, which is rendered by the lack of properly comprehending and accurately characterizing malicious attackers' capabilities, intents and aims, when targeting such systems. This is largely due to the lack of real malicious empirical data that can be captured, inferred, and analyzed from within the boundaries of such operational CPS realms. Undoubtedly, the goal which endeavors to capture notions of “true maliciousness” in the context of such CPS is significantly challenging, due to many factors, including, (1) the lack of complete maturity and the scarcity of elaborative technical details related to such CPS, (2) the significant diversity of such types of systems, and (3) logistic and privacy constraints which are often strictly enforced by CPS owners and operators. To this end, this paper presents a first step towards inferring tangible notions of maliciousness in the context of maritime transportation. This is accomplished through innovating various mechanisms, namely, investigating passive darknet Internet-scale traffic, instrumenting and analyzing millions of recent CPS malware samples, and deploying tailored, highly-interactive CPS honeypots. Additionally, we analyze the effect of a derived empirical attack, namely, a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, using a discrete event simulation in the context of a vessel passing a canal. We postulate that the envisioned derived attack models and their associated impact could be effectively exploited to successfully provide CPS marine transportation security and resiliency.","","978-1-5090-6484-7","10.1109/MTITS.2017.8005665","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8005665","Empirical analysis;Cyber-Physical Systems;CPS attacks;Marine Transportation;Model-Based Systems","Security;Sensors;Ports (Computers);Marine transportation;Control systems;Transportation;Containers","computer network security;cyber-physical systems;data privacy;discrete event simulation;freight containers;goods dispatch data processing;international trade;Internet;invasive software;marine engineering;sea ports;telecommunication traffic;transportation","maritime transportation;passive darknet Internet-scale traffic;CPS malware samples;highly-interactive CPS honeypots;distributed denial of service attack;DDoS attack;discrete event simulation;CPS marine transportation security;CPS marine transportation resiliency;international freight;international trade;market demands;ports;cyber-physical systems;container terminal sector;CPS security;logistic constraints;privacy constraints","","4","","42","","10 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In general, machine-learning-based business process automation is still viable with reduced classification accuracy due to such false decisions, thanks to business models that replace human decision processes with automated decision processes covering the costs of introducing automation and the losses from rare mistakes by the automation with the profits from relatively large savings in human-factor costs. However, under certain conditions, it is possible for attackers to outsmart a classifier at a reasonable cost and thus destroy the business model that the learner system depends on. Attackers may eventually detect the misclassification cases they can benefit from and try to create similar inputs that will be misclassified by the unaware learner system. We call adversaries of this type ""opportunistic adversaries"". This paper specifies the environmental patterns that can expose vulnerabilities to opportunistic adversaries and presents some likely business scenarios for these threats. Then we propose a countermeasure algorithm to detect such attacks based on change detection in the post-classification data distributions.

Being aware of the negative transfer we - instead of trying to alleviate the negative transfer - aim to maximise the positive transfer. We examine a basic networking deep transfer learning system and formulate the optimisation problem of achieving the most beneficial knowledge from a source deep learning model. In order to circumvent the optimisation problem, we further propose to employ a reinforcement learning approach, i.e., Q-learning algorithm. As a case study, a DDoS attack detection method using a Multilayer Perceptrons algorithm (MLP) is taken to demonstrate the effectiveness and capabilities of the Q- TRANSFER framework. Results obtained from extensive experiments confirm that the most beneficial attack detection knowledge is derived from the source deep learning model by applying the Q-learning algorithm.

The obtained information can be further analyzed to assist in the subsequent attack. Therefore, it is necessary to find an efficient way to detect Nmap scanning behavior. ET OPEN is a rule set widely used by the intrusion detection system (IDS) to protect hosts from malicious penetration. The Nmap detection rate is 58.3% with ET OPEN rules, but it becomes 8.3% when facing IDS evasion. Due to the low detection rate of ET OPEN, we propose the Comprehensive Nmap Detection Rules (CNDR). CNDR can detect the Nmap scanning behaviors precisely and efficiently. In the CNDR, Nmap's customizable fields are removed, and rules for operating system scanning are added. CNDR achieves 100% detection rate of normal Nmap scanning and 91.7% detection accuracy of Nmap with IDS evasion on our designed dataset.

Some studies showed Multiple Classifier Systems (MCSs) is more robust than single classifiers under an adversarial attack. This paper investigates the robustness of multiple classifier systems using different fusions of continuous-valued outputs on an application with Boolean feature experimentally. Our results suggest that the mean method is the most robust.","2160-1348","978-1-4799-4215-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2014.7009085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7009085","Multiple classifier system;Robustness;Adversarial environment;Evasion attack","Robustness;Abstracts;Pattern recognition","Boolean functions;computer network security;pattern classification","multiple classifier systems;evasion attack;pattern recognition system;intrusion detection;face recognition;spam mail fIltering;MCS;Boolean feature","","","","24","","15 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such a usage gap occurs mainly due to the difficulty to maintain the detection rate in acceptable level, given the occurrence of false alarms. In general, the literature does not consider the adversarial settings, when an opponent attempt to evade the detection system, thus possibly rendering the system unreliable over time. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a new approach to reliably perform real time stream learning for anomaly-based intrusion detection. We employ a class-specific stream outlier detector to automatically update the intrusion detection engine over the time, and a rejection mechanism, which makes it possible to obtain indications that an evasion attempt might being happening. Furthermore, the proposal is resilient to causative attacks, providing a secure intrusion detection mechanism even when the attacker can inject misclassified instances in the training dataset. The evaluation tests show that the proposed approach is resilient to exploratory attacks, allowing the system administrator to know when an evasion attempt might be occurring.","","978-1-5386-1629-1","10.1109/ISCC.2017.8024621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8024621","Adversarial Settings;Outlier Detection;Stream Learning;Intrusion Detection","Intrusion detection;Anomaly detection;Classification algorithms;Reliability;Training;Detectors","learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","stream learning;anomaly-based intrusion detection;adversarial settings;production environments;false alarms;class-specific stream outlier detector;rejection mechanism;causative attack resilience;secure intrusion detection mechanism","","4","","19","","4 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To lay the foundation for a deeper insight into the interest of potential attackers, a large scale honeynet system that captures all interactions using industrial protocols is proposed. Special for the honeynet system architecture is the automated deployment on a cloud infrastructure and its modularisation of the industrial protocols. The centralized-but-redundant data collection allows correlating attacks that happen on multiple devices. A real-world experiment confirms the feasibility of the approach, and results of the observed interactions with the honeynet are presented.","","978-9-8975-8140-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7518018","Industrial Control System Security;Honeypots;SCADA Security","Protocols;Security;Control systems;Industrial control;Cloud computing;Ports (Computers)","cloud computing;computer network security;control engineering computing;industrial control;protocols","centralized-but-redundant data collection;industrial protocol modularisation;cloud infrastructure;large scale honeynet system architecture;potential attackers;Internet;standardized industrial protocols;untargeted attacks;industrial control system;flexible Honeypots architecture","","","","16","","21 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the literature, there are various approaches for detecting masqueraders by modeling legitimate users' behavior during their daily tasks and automatically determine whether they are doing something suspicious. Usually, these techniques model user behavior using features extracted from various sources, such as file system, network activities, system calls, etc. In this work, we propose a one-class anomaly detection approach that measures similarities between a history of a user and events recorded in a timewindow of the user's session which is to be classified. The idea behind our solution is the application of a graph partitioning technique on weighted oriented graphs generated from such event sequences, while considering that strongly connected nodes have to belong into the same cluster. First, a history of vertex clusters is build per each user and then this history is compared to a new input by using a similarity function, which leads either to the acceptance or rejection of a new input. This makes our approach substantially different from existing general graph-based approaches that consider graphs as a single entity. The approach can be applied for different kinds of homogeneous event sequences, however successful application of the approach will be demonstrated on file system access events only. The linear time complexity of the approach was demonstrated in the experiments and the performance evaluation was done using two state-of-the-art datasets - WUIL and TWOS - both of them containing file system access logs of legitimate users and masquerade attackers; for WUIL dataset we achieved an average per-user AUC of 0.94, a TPR over 95%, and a FPR less than 10%, while for TWOS dataset we achieved an average per-user AUC of 0.851, a TPR over 91% and a FPR around 11%.","","978-1-5386-8276-0","10.1109/SPW.2018.00037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8424653","insider threat;masquerader;anomaly detection;graph partitioning;Markov cluster;file system","Security;Privacy;Conferences;Licenses","Bayes methods;file organisation;graph theory;pattern classification;security of data","file system access events;data exfiltration;network activities;one-class anomaly detection approach;graph partitioning technique;weighted oriented graphs;general graph-based approaches;homogeneous event sequences;file system access logs;masquerade attackers;user behavior;masqueraders detection;WUIL dataset;TWOS dataset","","4","","32","","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we study survivability issues for RFID. We first present an RFID survivability experiment to define a foundation to measure the degree of survivability of an RFID system under varying attacks. Then we model a series of malicious scenarios using stochastic process algebras and study the different effects of those attacks on the ability of the RFID system to provide critical services even when parts of the system have been damaged. Our simulation model relates its statistic to the attack strategies and security recovery. The model helps system designers and security specialists to identify the most devastating attacks given the attacker's capacities and the system's recovery abilities. The goal is to improve the system survivability given possible attacks. Our model is the first of its kind to formally represent and simulate attacks on RFID systems and to quantitatively measure the degree of survivability of an RFID system under those attacks.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.30","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5871653","RFID;survivability;quantification;experiment;and adversary.","Radiofrequency identification;Computer security;System recovery;Stochastic processes;Authentication","algebra;radiofrequency identification;stochastic processes;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","attack characterization;radio frequency identification;RFID system survivability experiment;stochastic process algebras;security recovery","","7","","29","","9 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
