"Energy Depletion Attack in Low Power and Lossy Networks: Analysis and Defenses","C. Pu; B. Groves",Marshall University; Marshall University,"2019 2nd International Conference on Data Intelligence and Security (ICDIS)","3 Oct 2019","2019","","","14","21","With increasingly popular computing devices endowed with sensing and communicating capabilities, low power and lossy networks (LLNs) are rapidly emerging as an important part of ubiquitous computing and communication infrastructure. In order to support the vision of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and its applications, a novel routing protocol for low power and lossy networks, also referred to as RPL, has been proposed to provide efficient and reliable communication and enable the integration of resource-constrained devices into the Internet. However, due to the shared wireless medium, the lack of physical protection, and instinctive resource constraints, RPL-based LLNs are undeniably vulnerable to various Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. In this paper, we propose a misbehavior-aware detection scheme, called MAD, against energy depletion attack in RPL-based LLNs, where a malicious node intentionally generates and sends a large number of packets to legitimate node to excessively consume the energy resource of intermediate nodes located along the forwarding path, and finally makes the resource-constrained network suffer from denial of service. In the MAD, each node maintains a count of the number of received packets from its child node within a specific time window, and then compares the count with a dynamically calculated threshold to detect potential energy depletion attack. We conduct extensive simulation experiments for performance evaluation and comparison with the original RPL with and without adversary, respectively. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is a viable approach against energy depletion attack in RPL-based LLNs.","","978-1-7281-2080-5","10.1109/ICDIS.2019.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8855275","Energy Depletion Attack, Denial-of-Service, RPL, Low Power and Lossy Networks, Internet-of-Things","Routing;Routing protocols;Internet of Things;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Denial-of-service attack","computer network security;Internet of Things;routing protocols;telecommunication power management","energy resource;intermediate nodes;resource-constrained network;child node;potential energy depletion attack;RPL-based LLNs;lossy networks;ubiquitous computing;communication infrastructure;Internet-of-Things;resource-constrained devices;shared wireless medium;instinctive resource constraints;Denial-of-Service attacks;misbehavior-aware detection scheme;malicious node;legitimate node","","5","","43","","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we present a novel approach to detect cyber attacks targeting measurements sent to control hardware, i.e., typically to Programmable Logical Controllers (PLC). The approach builds on the Gaussian mixture model to cluster sensor measurement values and a cluster assessment technique known as silhouette. We experimentally demonstrate that in this particular problem the Gaussian mixture clustering outperforms the k-means clustering algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is tested in a scenario involving the simulated Tennessee-Eastman chemical process and three different cyber attacks.","2378-363X","978-1-4799-6649-3","10.1109/INDIN.2015.7281725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7281725","","Clustering algorithms;Mathematical model;Gaussian mixture model;Computer crime;Engines;Process control","control engineering computing;Gaussian processes;mixture models;pattern clustering;process control;production engineering computing;programmable controllers;security of data","cyber attack detection;process control systems;PCS;Information and Communication Technologies;system of systems integration;ICT systems;computer attacks;programmable logical controllers;PLC;Gaussian mixture model;cluster sensor measurement values;cluster assessment technique;silhouette;simulated Tennessee-Eastman chemical process","","24","","23","","1 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a normal vehicle operation situation, controllers connected to a CAN bus transmit periodic and nonperiodic signals. Thus, if a CAN identifier (ID) sequence is configured by collecting the identifiers of CAN signals in their order of occurrence, it will have a certain pattern. However, if only a very small number of attack IDs are included in a CAN ID sequence, it will be difficult to detect the corresponding pattern change. Thus, a detection method that is different from the conventional one is required to detect such attacks. Since a CAN ID sequence can be regarded as a sentence consisting of words in the form of CAN IDs, a generative pretrained transformer (GPT) model can learn the pattern of a normal CAN ID sequence. Therefore, such a model is expected to be able to detect CAN ID sequences that contain a very small number of attack IDs better than the existing long short-term memory (LSTM)-based method. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection model that combines two GPT networks in a bi-directional manner to allow both past and future CAN IDs (relative to the time of detection) to be used. The proposed model is trained to minimize the negative log-likelihood (NLL) value of the bi-directional GPT network for a normal sequence. When the NLL value for a CAN ID sequence is larger than a prespecified threshold, it is deemed an intrusion. The proposed model outperforms a single uni-directional GPT model with the same degree of complexity as other existing LSTM-based models because the bi-directional structure of the proposed model maintains the estimation performance for most CAN IDs, regardless of their positions in the sequence.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3110524","Autocrypt Company Ltd., Republic of Korea, the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea, through the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) Support Program supervised by the Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion (IITP)(grant numbers:IITP-2021-2018-0-01433); Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture and Forestry (IPET) through the Smart Farm Innovation Technology Development Program; Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA)(grant numbers:421040-04); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9530394","Intrusion detection;generative pretrained transformer;GPT;controller area network;CAN;CAN ID;in-vehicle network;negative log-likelihood;NLL;spoofing attack","Protocols;Intrusion detection;Security;Performance evaluation;Bidirectional control;Object recognition;Licenses","computer network security;controller area networks;learning (artificial intelligence);on-board communications;pattern recognition;protocols;recurrent neural nets","generative pretrained transformer model;LSTM-based method;negative log-likelihood value;unidirectional GPT model;CAN ID sequence;bidirectional GPT network;intrusion detection model;long short-term memory-based method;CAN identifier sequence;nonperiodic signals;normal vehicle operation situation;controller area network bus protocol;in-vehicle controller area networks;intrusion detection method","","","","27","CCBY","6 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, as part of solution architectures, the use of Blockchain, Software Defined Networks (SDN), Machine Learning, and Fog/Edge computing are discussed as these are the most emerging technologies. Drones are highly resource-constrained devices and therefore it is not possible to deploy heavy security algorithms on board. Blockchain can be used to cryptographically store all the data that is sent to/from the drones, thereby saving it from tampering and eavesdropping. Various ML algorithms can be used to detect malicious drones in the network and to detect safe routes.

Even with the increasing sophistication of network attacks, basic network events such as connections between two IP addresses play an important role in any network defense. Given the duration of current attacks, long-term data archival is critical but typically very little of the data is ever accessed. Previous work has provided tools and identified the need to trace connections. However, traditional databases raise performance concerns as they are optimized for querying rather than ingestion. The study of write-optimized data structures (WODS) is a new and growing field that provides a novel approach to traditional storage structures (e.g., B-trees). WODS trade minor degradations in query performance for significant gains in the ability to quickly insert more data elements, typically on the order of 10 to 100 times more inserts per second. These efficient, out-of-memory data structures can play a critical role in enabling robust, long-term tracking of network events. In this paper, we present TWIAD, the Write-optimized IP Address Database. TWIAD uses a write-optimized B-tree known as a B"" tree to track all IP address connections in a network traffic stream. Our initial implementation focuses on utilizing lower cost hardware, demonstrating that basic long-term tracking can be done without advanced equipment. We tested TWIAD on a modest desktop system and showed a sustained ingestion rate of about 20,000 inserts per second.","","978-1-4673-8944-0","10.1109/BADGERS.2015.011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7809528","","Vegetation;Data structures;Databases;IP networks;Hardware;Monitoring;Security","computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;database management systems;IP networks;query processing;telecommunication traffic;tree data structures","write optimized data structures;write-optimized IP address database;TWIAD design;network traffic records;network security breaches;network attacks;network defense;long-term data archival;database querying;WODS;storage structures;query performance degradations;long-term network event tracking;write-optimized B-tree","","1","","37","","9 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we explore how machine learning methods used successfully in cyber domains, such as malware detection, can be leveraged to substantially enhance physical space detection. We focus on one important exemplar application-the detection and localization of radioactive materials. We show that the ML-based approaches can significantly exceed traditional table-based approaches in predicting angular direction. Moreover, the developed models can be expanded to include approximations of the distance to radioactive material (a critical dimension that reference tables used in practice do not capture). With four and eight detector arrays, we collect counts of gamma-rays as features for a suite of machine learning models to localize radioactive material. We explore seven unique scenarios via simulation frameworks frequently used for radiation detection and with physical experiments using radioactive material in laboratory environments. We observe that our approach can outperform the standard table-based method, reducing the angular error by 37% and reliably predicting distance within 2.4%. In this way, we show that advances in cyber-detection provide substantial opportunities for enhancing detection in public safety applications and beyond.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2021.3055778","U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Army Research Laboratory and was accomplished under Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF-13-2-0045 (ARL Cyber Security CRA); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1805310); U.S. Army Research Laboratory; U.S. Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-19-1-0374); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9343331","Machine Learning;security;gamma-ray detectors","Radioactive materials;Machine learning;Detectors;Feature extraction;Sensors;Gamma-rays;Attenuation","invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);radiation detection;risk analysis;weapons","radioactive material localization;cyber-security model optimizations;physical-space sensors;public safety applications;current detection methods;machine learning methods;cyber domains;malware detection;physical space detection;ML-based approaches;table-based approaches;machine learning models;radiation detection;physical experiments;standard table-based method;cyber-detection;exemplar application","","","","36","IEEE","1 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By examining two large, real-world datasets of phishing kits and URLs from 2016 through mid-2017, we paint a clear picture of today's anti-phishing ecosystem while inferring the higher-level motives and thought processes of phishers. We analyze the nature of server-side .htaccess filtering techniques used by phishers to evade detection by the security community. We also propose a new generic classification scheme for phishing URLs which corresponds to modern social engineering techniques and reveals a correlation between URL type and compromised infrastructure use. Our analysis identifies measures that can be taken by the security community to defeat phishers' countermeasures and increase the likelihood of a timely response to phishing.

Moreover, current attacks are becoming more sophisticated, as the attackers are attempting to evade traditional intrusion detection mechanisms by perverting their properties. This paper presents a novel real-time (ongoing) network traffic measurement approach that supports resilient analysis for stream learning intrusion detection. The network data is grouped at runtime according to its characteristics, while each network traffic flow is discretized at regular time intervals. Each network flow is classified by a multi-view stream learning classifiers pool, defining the network flow class through a majority voting approach. The proposal is able to provide resiliency to the classifiers even for the detection of unknown attacks. The evaluation tests for the average operation point (25 views) provides an increase in the system resilience to adversarial attacks of 22 % when compared to traditional approaches. Moreover, in the scalability experiments with a 10-node (single core each) cluster testbed, the network flow measurement solution (1 view) reached 1.38 Gbps throughput, while the proposed resilient stream learning intrusion detection with 25 views reached a throughput of 1.19 Gbps.","","978-1-5090-5019-2","10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254495","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8254495","","Telecommunication traffic;Intrusion detection;Real-time systems;Middleware;Training;Resilience","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","majority voting approach;system resilience;adversarial attacks;network flow measurement solution;resilient stream learning intrusion detection mechanism;real-time network traffic measurement approach;resilient analysis;network traffic real-time analysis;multiview stream learning classifiers","","4","","22","","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, legal regulations have also become effective that require automobile manufacturers to set up a monitoring system for fleet-wide security analysis. The growing amount of software, networking, and the automation of driving create new challenges for security. Context-awareness, situational understanding, adaptive security, and threat intelligence are necessary to cope with these ever-increasing risks. In-vehicle security should be adaptive to secure the car in an infinite number of (driving) situations. For fleet-wide analysis and alert triage, knowledge and understanding of the circumstances are required. Context-awareness, nonetheless, has been sparsely considered in the field of vehicle security. This work aims to be a precursor to context-aware, adaptive and intelligent security for vehicles and fleets.

Moreover, the lack of sufficiently large amount of data samples of IoT traffic and data privacy pose further challenges in developing a behavior-based anomaly detection system. To address these issues, we present an unsupervised hierarchical approach for anomaly detection through cooperation between generative adversarial network (GAN) and auto-encoder (AE). The problems of data aggregation and privacy preservation are addressed by reconstructing a sampling pool at a centralized controller using a collection of generators from the individual IoT networks. Then, a centralized global AE is trained and passed to individual local networks for anomaly detection after a final adaptation with the local raw data from the IoT nodes.

This model is used during operation to detect anomalies due to attacks or design faults. Ensemble methods have been used to improve the overall detection accuracy by combining the outputs of several accurate and diverse models. Existing Boolean combination techniques either require an exponential number of combinations or sequential combinations that grow linearly with the number of iterations, which make them difficult to scale up and analyze. In this paper, we propose PBC (Pruning Boolean Combination), an efficient approach for selecting and combining anomaly detectors. PBC relies on two novel pruning techniques that we have developed to aggressively prune redundant and trivial detectors. Compared to existing work, PBC reduces significantly the number of detectors to combine, while keeping similar accuracy.

In this paper, avoiding not to be filtered as well as causing false classification, an advanced robust AE generation attack is proposed. We first define four basic data correlations called strict linear constraint, approximate linear constraint, addition boundary constraint and zero multiplication constraint. Then, based on embedding multiple data correlations into one constraint matrix from the Pearson analysis, our approach can enable a Hadamard product of the constraint matrix and the sign of gradient matrix to craft perturbations, keeping consistent data correlations. Experimental results on intrusion detection system (IDS) indicate: 1) Nearly all AEs from original IFGSM are invalid by filtering according to basic data correlations; 2) In our method, AEs against a targeted DNN-based classifier can achieve an attack success rate of 99%, with transfer attack ability of 94% average success rate to attack other different mainstream classifiers.","2690-5965","978-1-7281-9074-7","10.1109/ICPADS51040.2020.00064","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972025,61802389,61672092,U1811264,61966009); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(grant numbers:2018JBZ103,2019RC008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9359196","deep neural network;adversarial examples generation;pearson correlation coefficient;feature constraints","Correlation;Filtering;Perturbation methods;Conferences;Intrusion detection;Distributed databases;Machine learning","deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;gradient methods;Hadamard matrices;information filtering;matrix algebra;pattern classification;security of data","basic filtering rules;advanced robust AE generation attack;basic data correlations;strict linear constraint;approximate linear constraint;addition boundary constraint;zero multiplication constraint;multiple data correlations;constraint matrix;consistent data correlations;intrusion detection system;feature pairs;fine data perturbation;potential data correlations;constraint-based adversarial examples;false classification;machine learning system;Pearson analysis;Hadamard product;gradient matrix;IDS;IFGSM;DNN-based classifier","","","","25","","25 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many existing approaches were proposed to detect the attack at the database level. The existing approach uses SVM classification for classification, which is the supervised learning algorithm, uses the syntactic and semantic features of the query parse tree. It takes more time for preprocessing of the query parse tree. In this paper, we fragmented the query parse tree to increase the speed of the preprocessing. The internal query tree can be obtained from the database log. To get instances for classification, the query tree is converted to n - dimensional feature vector by using multi - dimensional sequence. The semantic features are used as the component of feature vectors. And also the syntactic and semantic features are used to generate multi - dimensional sequences. Then the extracted feature is converted into a numeric value, if the feature contains any string value.

We have achieved 100% accuracy in fault detection along with avoiding false positives based on new extracted deep features, which outperform the results using existing features. Existing features are also classified with random forest to compare results. Deep autoencoder random forest provides better results due to the new deep features extracted from the dataset when compared to existing features.

However, in the field of cyber data, which has the same issue of data shortage, the research on data augmentation is insufficient. To solve this problem, we propose PcapGAN that can augment pcap data, a kind of network data. The proposed model includes an encoder, a data generator, and a decoder. The encoder subdivides network data into four parts. The generator generates new data for each part of the data. The decoder combines the generated data into realistic network data. We demonstrate the similarity between the generated data and original data, and validation of the generated data by increased performance of intrusion detection algorithms.","","978-1-7281-4550-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2019.00191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8999252","Cyber Data, Network Data, Generation, GAN, Encoder, Insturion Detection Algorithms","IP networks;Image edge detection;Generators;Protocols;Gallium nitride;Data models;Decoding","neural nets;security of data;supervised learning","packet capture file generator;style-based generative adversarial networks;cyber data;data shortage;data augmentation;PcapGAN;pcap data;data generator;realistic network data;intrusion detection;data decoder","","","","21","","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The advancement of connected vehicles, which generate dynamic data through wireless communications, enables ITS to improve their efficiency, especially in Traffic Signal Control (TSC), which is the backbone of traffic flow scheduling. However, wireless communications channels are vulnerable to various types of cyberattacks and can pose serious threats to dynamic TSC systems. Attackers may attempt to manipulate normal traffic flows and cause severe traffic congestion. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a powerful technique that has been used to improve TSC systems performance in real-time environments. However, it can be used by attackers to exploit the dynamics of the ITS and learn the optimal attack policy under the lack of deterministic information about system behavior. In this work, to highlight and exploit existing vulnerabilities in TSC systems, we leverage DRL to create an intelligent Sybil attack on a traffic intersection, wherein connected vehicles with fake identities are optimally placed to alter traffic signal timings by corrupting traffic data. The results show that this attack leads to substantial increase in the vehicles’ travel time and yields disastrous traffic congestion, especially if carried out for a prolonged period of time, which will give rise to serious problems such as higher fuel consumption and air pollution in heavily dense cities. In the presence of such intelligent attacks, the design assumptions of existing TSC systems become highly questionable.","","978-1-6654-0285-9","10.1109/CSR51186.2021.9527951","Canada Research Chairs; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9527951","Intelligent Transportation Systems;cybersecurity;Sybil attack;Traffic Signal Control;Reinforcement Learning","Wireless communication;Connected vehicles;Roads;Urban areas;Transportation;Dynamic scheduling;Timing","","","","","","29","","6 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a privacy-preserving decentralized approach, which keeps raw data on devices and involves local ML training while eliminating data communication overhead. A federation of the learned and shared models is then performed on a central server to aggregate and share the built knowledge among participants. This article starts by examining and comparing different ML-based deployment architectures, followed by in-depth and in-breadth investigation on FL. Compared to the existing reviews in the field, we provide in this survey a new classification of FL topics and research fields based on thorough analysis of the main technical challenges and current related work.

The field of stylometry uses linguistic features and machine learning techniques to answer these questions. While stylometry techniques can identify authors with high accuracy in non-adversarial scenarios, their accuracy is reduced to random guessing when faced with authors who intentionally obfuscate their writing style or attempt to imitate that of another author. While these results are good for privacy, they raise concerns about fraud. We argue that some linguistic features change when people hide their writing style and by identifying those features, stylistic deception can be recognized. The major contribution of this work is a method for detecting stylistic deception in written documents. We show that using a large feature set, it is possible to distinguish regular documents from deceptive documents with 96.6% accuracy (F-measure).

For example, autonomous vehicles can communicate electronically with one another, make fast decisions and associated actuation, and generally act deterministically. In contrast, manual vehicles cannot communicate electronically, are limited by the capabilities and slow reaction of human drivers, and may show some uncertainty and even irrationality in behavior due to the involvement of humans. At the same time, humans can react properly to more complex situations than autonomous vehicles. Unlike manual vehicles, the security of computing and communications of autonomous vehicles can be compromised thereby precluding them from achieving individual or group goals.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3090721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9480797","","Special issues and sections;Deep learning;Safety;Security;Autonomous vehicles;Intrusion detection;Generative adversarial networks;Vehicular ad hoc networks","","","","","","0","IEEE","12 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
