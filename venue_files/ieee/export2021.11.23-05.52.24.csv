Discovering adversarial activities before or as they happen, through any modality, makes a system more secure. A straight forward approach to determine threat level from typing data would be to analyze the text directly. However, natural language processing is hard to implement on complex real life data, therefore we explore how far keystroke dynamics can go in terms of classifying threat levels correctly. We show that keystroke dynamics (KD) on a desktop can be used to classify the type of activity, either benign or adversarial, that a text sample originates from. We show the inefficiencies of popular temporal features for this task. With our proposed set of 14 features we achieve high accuracies (93% to 97%) and low Type 1 and Type 2 errors (3% to 8%) in classifying text samples of different sizes. We further reduce our feature set to eight using correlation analysis with marginal trade-offs in accuracy and error rates. We collected data from 102 users for benign activities and 103 users for adversarial activities recording over 1.9 million keystroke events in total. Our experiments show that a user's typing behavior can reveal the nature of the typing activity, thereby providing vital cues of a system's threat level.","2640-5768","978-1-7281-4458-0","10.1109/AISP48273.2020.9073079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9073079","Keystrokes;Threat-Level;Keystroke-Features;Typing;Context","Data collection;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Standards;Monitoring;Keyboards;Intrusion detection","biometrics (access control);correlation methods;feature extraction;natural language processing;neural nets;pattern classification;text analysis","feature set;error rates;benign activities;adversarial activities;typing activity;keystroke dynamics;system intrusion;data-driven world;straight forward approach;typing data;natural language processing;complex real life data;temporal features;text analysis;text samples classification;correlation analysis;users typing behavior;systems threat level classification","","","","22","","23 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These digital systems are prone to vulnerabilities/attacks, and exploitation of these vulnerabilities may cause major impacts on the electric grid performance. Multiple alarms reported in the control center could be a result of the faults (expected operations) or failures in the protection system (anomalies/ unexpected operation). Situational awareness gained through sensors such as a phasor measurement unit (PMU) and data acquired through the cyber system provide an opportunity to develop continuous cyber-physical monitoring of the system. Note that relay data are not reported in the control center continuously. This paper presents a cyber-physical data analytics based technique to monitor transmission protection system and detect malicious activity. Initially, continuous monitoring of PMU data is utilized for data anomaly detection, which includes bad or missing data using long short-term memory (LSTM). Then, PMU data of interest are utilized for failure diagnosis, using a semisupervised deep autoencoder model. In this research, cyber anomalies are modeled by manipulating the setting/logic design of protective devices, and a ridge regression based classifier with a feature engineering pipeline is used to detect cyber anomalies. The results from the deep autoencoder model and ridge regression based classifier are then utilized for detailed investigation to find the root causes of the observed events assisted by the cyber log data from the protection devices. The algorithm is validated using a real-time simulation of the IEEE test system with industrial hardware relays and PMUs in the loop. Data analytics algorithm running on server utilizes these real-time data continuously for anomaly detection and classification for the developed use cases.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2019.2928500","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1840192); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8762160","Cyber anomalies;cyber-physical systems;cyber security;data analytics;digital protection;transmission protection systems","Phasor measurement units;Logic gates;Circuit faults;Relays;Data analysis;Anomaly detection;Power grids","computerised monitoring;data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);phasor measurement;power engineering computing;power system measurement;power system security;regression analysis;security of data;smart power grids","bad data;missing data;PMU data;semisupervised deep autoencoder model;cyber anomalies;protective devices;cyber log data;protection devices;IEEE test system;data analytics algorithm;real-time data;classification;cyber physical security analytics;transmission protection system;transmission system;digital systems;control center;cyber system;continuous cyber-physical monitoring;relay data;cyber-physical data analytics;continuous monitoring;data anomaly detection","","15","","32","IEEE","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We extract useful univariate summary statistics and perform anomaly detection in a single-dimensional space. We model anomalies as persistent outliers and propose to detect them via a cumulative sum-like algorithm. In case the observed data have a low intrinsic dimensionality, we find a submanifold in which the nominal data are embedded and evaluate whether the sequentially acquired data persistently deviate from the nominal submanifold. Further, in the general case, we determine an acceptance region for nominal data via Geometric Entropy Minimization and evaluate whether the sequentially observed data persistently fall outside the acceptance region. We provide an asymptotic lower bound and an asymptotic approximation for the average false alarm period of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, we provide a sufficient condition to asymptotically guarantee that the decision statistic of the proposed algorithm does not diverge in the absence of anomalies.

However, such cooperation is vulnerable to be threatened by spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attacks. Many previous attacker detection schemes rely on some strong assumptions, such as prior knowledge of the local performance of each secondary user (SU) and higher attack probability. To overcome these drawbacks, in this article, we develop a Bayesian-inference-based sliding window trust model to identify and weed out independent and collaborative probabilistic SSDF attackers without any prior knowledge of the attack behaviors. Based on this model, the trust value of each SU is obtained by combining the weighted intermediate sensing information from multiple small sliding windows. A sigmoid-log-function-based scheme is introduced to mitigate trust value fluctuations caused by different attacking probabilities. Finally, extensive simulation results show that compared with existing schemes, the proposed approach can identify probabilistic SSDF attackers effectively and isolate them with a higher detection rate across a wide range of attacking scenarios.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2019.2936263","Sichuan Province Science and Technology Program Research Project(grant numbers:2019YJ0174); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8822487","Bayesian inference;collaborative spectrum sensing;probabilistic spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attack;trust evaluation and computation","Cooperative communication;Radio networks;Radio spectrum management;Bayes methods;Cognitive radio;Signal detection","cognitive radio;cooperative communication;probability;radio networks;radio spectrum management;signal detection;telecommunication security","independent SSDF attackers;higher attack probability;previous attacker detection schemes;spectrum sensing data falsification attacks;collaborative spectrum sensing;cognitive radio networks;probabilistic SSDF attack;window trust model;Bayesian-inference-based;attacking scenarios;different attacking probabilities;trust value fluctuations;sigmoid-log-function-based scheme;multiple small sliding windows;weighted intermediate sensing information;SU;attack behaviors;collaborative probabilistic SSDF attackers","","","","52","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most systems are not designed for modern high-speed network links. In the field of network monitoring, an alternative solution has become the choice for such high-speed networks. Flow-monitoring, typically based on the Internet Protocol Flow Information Export (IPFIX) standard, now goes well beyond collecting statistical information about network connections. Current solutions are even able to include selected parts of the payload in these Flows to be used in conjunction with NIDS. Recently, we extended this concept to application layer HTTP Flows. We now present our improved version of the IPFIX-based Signature-based Intrusion Detection System (FIXIDS). FIXIDS makes use of HTTP intrusion detection signatures from the popular Snort system and applies them to incoming IPFIX-conforming HTTP Flows. Our evaluation shows that FIXIDS can deal with four times higher network data rates without drops compared to Snort, while maintaining the same event detection rate. Furthermore, a substantial part of the data traffic can be outsourced to FIXIDS so that Snort can be relieved of a significant portion of rules and traffic. This increases both the detection rate and the data rate the overall security appliance can handle.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2020.2973992","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(grant numbers:DR 639/20-1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8999496","Network security;intrusion detection;flow monitoring;high-speed networks","Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Internet;Payloads;Protocols;Hardware;Throughput","","","","2","","","IEEE","14 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

By modifying the source code of a malware to receive parameters from a GAN, it was possible to adapt the behavior of its Command and Control (C2) channel to mimic the behavior of Facebook chat network traffic. In this way, it was possible to avoid the detection of new-generation Intrusion Prevention Systems that use machine learning and behavioral characteristics. A real-life scenario was successfully implemented using the Stratosphere behavioral IPS in a router, while the malware and the GAN were deployed in the local network of our laboratory, and the C2 server was deployed in the cloud. Results show that a GAN can successfully modify the traffic of a malware to make it undetectable.

These attacks over a secure channel make networked systems more vulnerable to new threats and increase the possibility of significant damage to other end users. Traditional TCP/IP-level traffic inspections do not suffice in investigating a secure sockets layer (SSL) conversation because the SSL conversation data is encrypted by a public key system and the SSL uses its own data unit of an SSL record. In this paper, we propose a novel malicious SSL traffic detection method, which reassembles SSL records from captured IP packets and inspects the characteristics of SSL records using a deep learning method. After an SSL record is reassembled from a single or multiple IP packets, the proposed method extracts unencrypted contents of the reassembled record and generates a sequence of unencrypted data from successive SSL records for deep learning-based classification. The sequences of SSL records are encoded using a long short-term memory autoencoder, and then an encoded feature map is generated for each SSL flow. These feature maps are forwarded to the convolutional neural network-based classifier to determine whether the SSL flow is malicious or not. The experiment shows that our proposed approach has a great separability between benign and malicious traffic flows on an encrypted SSL channel.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3064561","National Research Foundation (NRF) through the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) of Korean Government(grant numbers:2020R1F1A1060941); Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) funded by the Korea Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2017-0-00421); IITP funded by MSIT through the Artificial Intelligence Graduate School Program (GIST)(grant numbers:2019-0-01842); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9373407","Cryptographic protocols;deep learning;intrusion detection;network security","Cryptography;Inspection;Protocols;Deep learning;Payloads;Feature extraction;Computer crime","","","","","","50","CCBYNCND","9 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, Bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) is used to detect incidents over unified threat management (UTM) platform operated on cloud network. Results are compared with K-nearest neighbor which is a baseline technique. Time series input samples recorded over UTM platform are used for training and testing purposes. We obtain accuracy score of 98.47% with 0.0186 mean squared error (MSE) using KNN while BLSTM provides 98.6% accuracy score with 0.002 loss, which is better than the KNN.","","978-1-7281-4069-8","10.1109/IDAACS.2019.8924299","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8924299","Bidirectional LSTMs;Time Series Prediction;Incident Detection;threats detection","Logic gates;Cloud computing;Time series analysis;Recurrent neural networks;Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Security","cloud computing;computer network security;cryptography;data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets","incident detection;unified threat management platform;cloud network;Artificial Intelligence techniques;intelligent methods;security solutions;cloud computing;health records;individual;AI achieves security mechanisms;cryptography;machine learning methods;data analysis techniques;modern AI techniques help;security systems;criminal activities;data analysis tools;hacking activities;baseline technique;UTM platform","","","","14","","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, existing intrusion detection techniques are not effective in detecting compromised IoT devices given the massive scale of the problem in terms of the number of different types of devices and manufacturers involved. In this paper, we present DÏoT, an autonomous self-learning distributed system for detecting compromised IoT devices. DÏoT builds effectively on device-type-specific communication profiles without human intervention nor labeled data that are subsequently used to detect anomalous deviations in devices' communication behavior, potentially caused by malicious adversaries. DÏoT utilizes a federated learning approach for aggregating behavior profiles efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first system to employ a federated learning approach to anomaly-detection-based intrusion detection. Consequently, DÏoT can cope with emerging new and unknown attacks. We systematically and extensively evaluated more than 30 off-the-shelf IoT devices over a long term and show that DÏoT is highly effective (95.6% detection rate) and fast (257 ms) at detecting devices compromised by, for instance, the infamous Mirai malware.

Effectively detecting a flooding attack to the SIP proxy server is critical to ensure robust multimedia communications over the Internet. The existing flooding detection schemes are inefficient in detecting low-rate flooding from dynamic background traffic, or may even totally fail when flooding is launched in a multi-attribute manner by simultaneously manipulating different types of SIP messages. In this paper, we develop an online detection scheme for SIP flooding attacks, by integrating a novel three-dimensional sketch design with the Hellinger distance (HD) detection technique. In our sketch design, each SIP attribute is associated with a two-dimensional sketch hash table, which summarizes the incoming SIP messages into a probability distribution over the sketch table. The evolution of the probability distribution can then be monitored through HD analysis for flooding attack detection. Our three-dimensional design offers the benefit of high detection accuracy even for low-rate flooding, robust performance under multi-attribute flooding, and the capability of selectively discarding the offending SIP messages to prevent the attacks from bringing damages to the network. Furthermore, we design a scheme to control the distribution of the normal traffic over the sketch. Such a design ensures our detection scheme's effectiveness even under the severe distributed denial of service (DDoS) scenario, where attackers can flood over all the sketch table entries. In this paper, we not only theoretically analyze the performance of the proposed detection techniques, but also resort to extensive computer simulations to thoroughly examine the performance.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2014.2302298","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6720187","Session initiation protocol;flooding attack;multi-dimensional sketch;Hellinger distance","High definition video;Session initiation protocol ;Protocols;Probability distribution","computer network security;IP networks;multimedia communication;signalling protocols;telecommunication traffic","SIP flooding attack detection;multidimensional sketch design;session initiation protocol;multimedia communication sessions;Internet protocol;SIP proxy server;robust multimedia communication;flooding detection scheme;low-rate flooding;dynamic background traffic;multiattribute manner;SIP messages;online detection scheme;three-dimensional sketch design;Hellinger distance detection technique;HD detection technique;SIP attribute;two-dimensional sketch hash table;probability distribution;HD analysis;three-dimensional design;high detection accuracy;robust performance;multiattribute flooding;normal traffic;distributed denial of service scenario;DDoS scenario;sketch table entry;computer simulation","","39","","26","IEEE","23 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In these systems, hazards can be due either to system failure or cyber-attacks factors. Accurate hazard detection and reducing reconfiguration time after hazard is one of the most important objectives in these systems. One of the procedures that can reduce the reconfiguration time is determining the cause of hazards and, based on the aforementioned factors, adopting the best commands in reconfiguration time. However, it is difficult to differentiate between different types of hazard because their effects on the system can be similar. With the advent of IoT into ICS, known as IIoT, it has become possible to differentiate the hazards through the adoption of data from different IIoT sensors in the environment. In this article, we propose a risk management approach that identifies hazards based on the physical nature of these systems with the support from the IIoT. The identified hazards fall into four categories: stealthy attack, random attack, transient failure, and permanent failure. Then, the reconfiguration process is run based on the proposed differentiation, which provides a better performance and reconfiguration time.

The trust management mechanism plays an important role in protecting network security. Many theories, e.g., subjective logic, Bayesian, cloud model, entropy theory, evidence theory, etc., have been adopted to evaluate the node trust of wireless sensor networks. However, due to the unique characteristics of the underwater dynamic environment, the existing trust mechanisms used in traditional networks (such as P2P networks, Ad-hoc networks, etc.) cannot be directly used in UWSNs. Therefore, this paper proposes a new trust evaluation and update mechanism for underwater wireless sensor networks based on the C4.5 decision tree algorithm (TEUC). In the TEUC, trust evidences are first collected including data-based, link-based and node-based trust evidences. Then, the collected trust evidences are used to train the C4.5 decision tree. In addition, the reward and penalty factors are defined to update trust based on the sliding time window. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional ones in a dynamic network environment in terms of malicious node detection and energy consumption.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2020.2999566","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2018YFC0407900); Jiangsu Provincial Six Talent Peaks; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971206); State Key Laboratory of Acoustics(grant numbers:SKLA201901); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9106851","UWSNs;trust evaluation;trust update;C4.5 decision tree","Wireless sensor networks;Security;Cloud computing;Entropy;Uncertainty;Heuristic algorithms;Decision trees","decision trees;marine communication;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","dynamic trust evaluation;update mechanism;underwater wireless sensor networks;trust management mechanism;network security;node trust;underwater dynamic environment;C4.5 decision tree algorithm;node-based trust evidences;collected trust evidences;dynamic network environment","","2","","37","IEEE","2 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Countermeasures have been developed, but still many users are infected. Detecting and preventing communication by infected users from the network side would effectively mitigate the threats of malware. For this, we need to collect information about the destinations or payloads of malware communication. Dynamic analysis is usually used to obtain this information. Since some malware requires access to the Internet, e.g., bots and downloaders, the dynamic analysis environment must connect to the Internet. Recently developed malware communicates with remote hosts by HTTP protocol for not only command-and-control (C&C) or malware downloading but also attacks. For secure dynamic analysis in an environment with Internet connectivity, it is necessary to determine if the destination is for C&C or malware downloading and to only allow connection to these servers. We propose a dynamic analysis system with Internet connection that controls HTTP communication by using a search engine. To control HTTP connections, we built a classifier using a support vector machine based on the assumption that sites for C&C or malware downloading, for example, are harder to find and have a lower backlink count than benign sites. Our classifier, which is trained on popular URLs and URLs based on malware analysis, has 99.69% cross-validation accuracy. We evaluated other known benign popular sites with our classifier, and they were all classified as benign. Our evaluation confirms that our classifier can distinguish benign sites, so the proposed dynamic analysis system is effective for safe analysis in an environment with Internet connection.","","978-1-4577-1035-3","10.1109/CSS.2011.6058563","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6058563","malware;dynamic analysis;search engine;support vector machine","Internet;Protocols;Malware;Search engines;Irrigation;Payloads;Fires","command and control systems;Internet;invasive software;search engines;support vector machines;system monitoring;transport protocols","malware HTTP communications;secure dynamic analysis system;search engine;infected user detection;communication prevention;malware communication;HTTP protocol;command-and-control;malware downloading;Internet connection;support vector machine;URLs;malware analysis","","17","","20","","24 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, the massive end devices (IoTs) and the large volume of data raise security and privacy challenges. To tackle these issues, the joint use of the Bockchain (BC) and Machine Learning (ML) seems attractive to achieve decentralized, secure, intelligent and efficient management of networks. On the one hand, the BC can greatly facilitate the sharing of training data and ML models, the decentralization of intelligence, security, privacy and reliable ML decision-making. On the other hand, ML may have significant impacts on the development of BC in communications and networking systems, including energy and resource efficiency, scalability, security, privacy and smart contracting. An important aspect of security intends to detect unusual and potentially inappropriate activities according to traffic patterns. This paper focuses on the problem of imbalance data where the number of abnormal samples is significantly lower than that of the normal (secure) ones. In particular, this paper presents a new equilibrium model based on an exciting recent innovation in ML namely Generator Adverse Networks (GANs) to address the problem of class imbalance and data noise to Intrusion Detection System (IDS) performance.

In particular, organized and stealthy adversaries can launch various types of data falsification attacks from multiple meters using smart or persistent strategies. In this paper, we propose a real time, two tier attack detection scheme to detect orchestrated data falsification under a sophisticated threat model in decentralized micro-grids. The first detection tier monitors whether the Harmonic to Arithmetic Mean Ratio of aggregated daily power consumption data is outside a normal range known as safe margin. To confirm whether discrepancies in the first detection tier is indeed an attack, the second detection tier monitors the sum of the residuals (difference) between the proposed ratio metric and the safe margin over a frame of multiple days. If the sum of residuals is beyond a standard limit range, the presence of a data falsification attack is confirmed. Both the `safe margins' and the `standard limits' are designed through a `system identification phase', where the signature of proposed metrics under normal conditions are studied using real AMI micro-grid data sets from two different countries over multiple years. Subsequently, we show how the proposed metrics trigger unique signatures under various attacks which aids in attack reconstruction and also limit the impact of persistent attacks. Unlike metrics such as CUSUM or EWMA, the stability of the proposed metrics under normal conditions allows successful real time detection of various stealthy attacks with ultra-low false alarms.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2018.2889729","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1818942,CNS-1545037,CNS-1545050,DGE-1433659); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8588368","Statistical anomaly detection;cyber-physical security;smart grid;false data injection;data falsification","Measurement;Power demand;Meters;Smart meters;Standards;Real-time systems;Aggregates","computer network security;power consumption;power engineering computing;smart meters;smart power grids;telecommunication security","stealthy data falsification;smart Metering Infrastructure;false power consumption data;compromised smart meters;Advanced Metering Infrastructure;smart grids;organized adversaries;stealthy adversaries;data falsification attacks;multiple meters;smart strategies;persistent strategies;tier attack detection scheme;orchestrated data falsification;sophisticated threat model;decentralized microgrids;detection tier monitors;Arithmetic Mean Ratio;aggregated daily power consumption data;normal range;safe margin;residuals;ratio metric;multiple days;standard limit range;AMI microgrid data sets;multiple years;metrics trigger unique signatures;attack reconstruction;persistent attacks;stealthy attacks","","2","","37","IEEE","25 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence in this paper, we first assume the role of an attacker to launch evasion attacks on anomaly detection systems. We show that the ADSs can be completely paralyzed by parameter estimation attacks. We then present a mathematical model to measure evasion margin with the aim to understand the science of evasion due to ADS design. Finally, to minimize the evasion margin, we propose a key-based randomization scheme for existing ADSs and discuss its robustness against evasion attacks.

A container-based SCADA testbed is presented in this work as a potential platform for executing cybersecurity experiments. Through this testbed, a network traffic containing ARP spoofing is generated that represents a Man in the middle (MITM) attack. While doing so, scanning of different systems within the network is performed which represents a reconnaissance attack. The network traffic generated by both ARP spoofing and network scanning are captured and further used for preparing a dataset.

Therefore, there is a need for few-shot detection. In this paper, a detection method based on a meta-learning framework is proposed for this purpose. The proposed method can be used to distinguish and compare a pair of network traffic samples as a basic task of learning, including a normal unaffected sample and a malicious one. To accomplish this task, we design a deep neural network (DNN) named FC-Net, which mainly comprises two parts: feature extraction network and comparison network. FC-Net learns a pair of feature maps for classification from a pair of network traffic samples, then compares the obtained feature maps, and finally determines whether the pair of samples belongs to the same type. To evaluate the proposed detection method, we construct two datasets for few-shot network intrusion detection based on real network traffic data sources, using a specifically developed approach. The experimental results indicate that the proposed detection method is universal and is not limited to specific datasets or attack types. Training and testing on the same datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve the average detection rate up to 98.88%. The outcome of training on one dataset and testing on the other one confirms that the proposed method can achieve better performance. In a few-shot scenario, malicious samples in an untrained dataset can be detected successfully, and the average detection rate is up to 99.62%.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2020.2991876","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61471314); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9083983","Network security;intrusion detection system;meta-learning;few-shot learning;deep learning","Task analysis;Feature extraction;Network intrusion detection;Training;Knowledge engineering","computer network security;feature extraction;neural nets;telecommunication traffic","detection method;meta-learning framework;network traffic samples;deep neural network;feature extraction network;comparison network;feature maps;few-shot network intrusion detection;network traffic data sources;average detection rate;few-shot scenario;malicious samples;supervised learning techniques;few-shot detection;FC-Net","","5","","42","IEEE","1 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, intelligent devices are classified into different groups according to the level of dissemination capability by hierarchical mechanism, which takes the networks topology into account. And subsequently, intelligent device's discriminant ability can be evaluated by sender's identity and information attributes.

Existing approaches to EKs detection usually need to perform dynamic analysis on the content contained in the network traffic, which requires dumping all the network traffic and thus causes high detection overhead. Although some approaches detect EKs based on static analysis, they usually fail to restore the complete attack path because of the obstruction set by the attackers. In this paper, we propose an approach that can detect EKs based on only information extracted by static analysis. Our method builds a graph for web sessions and extracts features from the graph to perform EKs detection.

Different techniques have been studied and developed throughout the years. For example, Federated Learning (FL), which is an emerging learning technique that is very well known for preserving and respecting the privacy of the collaborating clients' data during model training. Therefore, in this paper, the concepts of FL and Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) are evaluated and compared with respect of detection accuracy and speed of convergence, through simulating an Intrusion Detection System for Internet-of-Things applications. The imbalanced NSL-KDD dataset was used in this work. Despite its infrastructure overhead, HFL proved its superiority over FL in terms of training loss, testing accuracy, and speed of convergence in three study cases.

Behavior features based on API play an important role in analyzing malware variants. However, the existing malware detection approaches have a lot of complex operations on construction and matching. Graph matching is an NP-complete problem and is time-consuming because of computational complexity. To address these issues, a promising approach is proposed to construct the classified behavior features from different malware families. In the proposed approach, a classified behavior feature consists of a kernel object (an API call parameter) and a series of operations (an API trace). Besides, a classified behavior graph (CBG) is represented as a number by hash to reduce workload and matching time. Subsequently, multiple machine learning classifiers are used for system classification. In particular, to verify the efficiency of our approach, we perform a series of experiments with different families. The experiments on 1220 malware samples show that the true positive rate is up to 88.3% and the false positive rate keeps within 3.9% by the support vector machine (SVM).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2924331","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601041); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2018RC55); Beijing Talents Foundation(grant numbers:2017000020124G062); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8743350","API call parameter;classified behavior;malware variant;SVM","Malware;Feature extraction;Static analysis;Operating systems;Telecommunications;Security;NP-complete problem","application program interfaces;computational complexity;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines","classified behavior feature;different malware families;API;classified behavior graph;matching time;multiple machine learning classifiers;application programming interface;procedure call interface;operating system resource;detection approaches;complex operations;graph matching;NP-complete problem;computational complexity;malware variants detection","","2","","38","CCBY","21 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The game model is derived from Stackelberg games called a Multi-stage Maze Network Game (M<sup>2</sup>NG) in which the characteristics of APT are fully considered. The possible plans of the attacker are compactly represented using attack graphs(AGs), but the compact representation of the attacker's strategies presents a computational challenge and reaching the Nash Equilibrium(NE) is NP-hard. We present a method that first translates AGs into Markov Decision Process(MDP) and then achieves the optimal SRs allocation using the policy hill-climbing(PHC) algorithm.

Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is used to generate link fingerprints after every 60 seconds, which are sent to the Data Concentrator Unit (DCU). The DCU applies these algorithms on the received link fingerprints in order to detect any unwanted activity. MICAz motes are used as communication module of SM and adversary to generate RSSI values. These RSSI values are simulated in MATLAB in which it detects adversarial node or meter tempering with 100% accuracy by getting values other than 0 and 1 as the average of consecutive RSSI and distance between the RSSI of connected SMs.","2577-2465","978-1-7281-1217-6","10.1109/VTCSpring.2019.8746620","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8746620","","Meters;Smart meters;Random access memory;Nickel;Memory management;Authentication","computer network security;power system security;RSSI;smart meters;smart power grids","energy theft control;light-weight security solution;AMI networks;received link fingerprints;RSSI values;meter tempering;connected SMs;smart meters;advanced metering infrastructure;adversarial node detection;received signal strength indicator;AMI;data concentrator unit;DCU;MICAz motes;communication module","","1","","21","","27 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence this work is focused to implement an Intrusion detection and prevention system using Deep Learning that can immediately detect the attacks such as DOS, Probe, R2L and U2R and prevent the same. The intrusion when arises is detected using a Deep Learning model called Multi-Layer Perceptron trained by the dataset kddcup99 with high accuracy. Appropriate data from network is captured and it is stored as a csv file and is fed to the implemented Deep learning model to predict the attack in a real time manner, thus detection is achieved. In second phase, the intrusion is prevented using a script that runs in the background. The script is developed to perform the prevention phase by taking appropriate decision on the different prevention function to be performed for different types of attacks. The decision can be made by using the data from the classification part achieved through the Multi-Layer Perceptron model.

The methods on neural network have been proved more accurate and practical for password guessing than traditional methods. However, a raw neural network model is not qualified for cross-sites attack since each data set has its own features. This paper proposes a general deep learning model for password guessing, called GENPass. GENPass can learn features from several data sets and ensure the output wordlist high accuracy in different data sets by using adversarial generation. The password generator of GENPass is PCFG+LSTM(PL), where LSTM is a kind of Recurrent Neural Network. We combine neural network with PCFG because we found people were used to set their passwords with meaningful strings. Compared with LSTM, PL increased the matching rate by 16%-30% in the cross-sites tests when learning from a single dataset. GENPass uses several PL models to learn datasets and generate passwords. The result shows that the matching rate of GENPass is 20% higher than that of simply mixing those datasets in the cross-sites test.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-3180-5","10.1109/ICC.2018.8422243","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8422243","","Password;Neural networks;Computational modeling;Markov processes;Machine learning;Probabilistic logic;Grammar","context-free grammars;cryptographic protocols;learning (artificial intelligence);probability;recurrent neural nets;social networking (online);statistical analysis","PCFG+LSTM;statistical probability;PL models;cross-sites test;matching rate;Recurrent Neural Network;password generator;raw neural network model;probabilistic context-free grammars;Markov Model;brute-force attack methods;social network;adversarial generation;PCFG rules;password guessing;general deep learning model;GENPass","","5","","36","","30 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, the CR technology became the first step towards the intelligentization of mobile and wireless networks, and in order to strengthen its intelligent operation, the cognitive engine needs to be enhanced through the exploitation of artificial intelligence (AI) strategies. Since comprehensive literature reviews covering the integration and application of deep architectures in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are still lacking, this article aims at filling the gap by presenting a detailed review that addresses the integration of deep architectures into the intricacies of spectrum management. This is a prospective review whose primary objective is to provide an in-depth exploration of the recent trends in AI strategies employed in mobile and wireless communication networks.

In this paper, we propose Vesper: a novel plug-and-play MitM detector for local area networks. Vesper uses a technique inspired from impulse response analysis used in the domain of acoustic signal processing. Analogous to how echoes in a cave capture the shape and construction of the environment, so to can a short and intense pulse of ICMP echo requests model the link between two network hosts. Vesper uses neural networks called autoencoders to model the normal patterns of the echoed pulses and detect when the environment changes. Using this technique, Vesper is able to detect MitM attacks with high accuracy while incurring minimal network overhead. We evaluate Vesper on LANs consisting of video surveillance cameras, servers, and PC workstations. We also investigate several possible adversarial attacks against Vesper and demonstrate how Vesper mitigates these attacks.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2018.2883177","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8543616","Man in the middle;anomaly detection;echo-analysis;LAN security","Local area networks;Switches;Hardware;Protocols;IP networks;Detectors;Network topology","computer network security;image sequences;Internet;IP networks;learning (artificial intelligence);local area networks;neural nets;telecommunication traffic;video surveillance","Vesper;local area networks;impulse response analysis;network hosts;neural networks;echoed pulses;MitM attacks;minimal network overhead;possible adversarial attacks;echo analysis;man-in-the-middle attack;cyber attack;popular attack vector;high false positive rate;PC workstations;LAN","","4","","32","IEEE","23 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this framework, two networks compete with each other, wherein the first network generates fake data, and the second one is responsible for the data classification. In order to get into the most optimal features, a new optimization method based on a modified teaching-learning based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is also devised to reinforce the GAN model and help a better matching training process.

However, abnormal operation of industrial robots caused by sensor failures may interrupt the entire manufacturing process, thereby increasing production costs. In this paper, we first propose a domain-specific framework consisting of offline training and online inference to effectively detect anomalies in the scenario of industrial robotic sensors. In a nutshell, the framework can be identified in three folds: (1) the offline training obtaining historical data from the database to train the time series and anomaly detection models; (2) the online inference deploying the offline trained models for online anomaly detection in real-time; (3) the incremental learning updating the online model for a new type of anomalies. We then propose an improved Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) named MSGAN with the adaptive update strategy mechanism based on WGAN-GP to generate fake anomaly samples, improving anomaly detection accuracy. Specifically, the Wasserstein distance with the gradient penalty is introduced to improve training stability and sample quality. Moreover, adapting the generator’s complexity in robotic sensors, an adaptive update strategy based on the loss change ratio is adopted to speed up training convergence. Extensive experiments based on real robotic sensor datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the detection accuracy can be improved by the synthetic samples based on the proposed MSGAN algorithm.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2021.3069452","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9389530","Industrial robots;Generative adversarial network (GAN);Machine learning;Anomaly detection","Anomaly detection;Sensors;Robot sensing systems;Training;Data models;Service robots;Time series analysis","","","","","","","IEEE","29 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This work covers a messaging framework (rDSN) that was developed to allow for the real-time analysis of malicious traffic. This data was captured from multiple, distributed honeypots and network telescopes. Data was collected over a period of two months from these data sensors. Using this data new techniques for malicious host analysis and re-identification in dynamic IP address space were explored. An Automated Reconnaissance (AR) Framework was developed to aid the process of data collection, this framework was responsible for gathering information from malicious hosts through both passive and active fingerprinting techniques. From the analysis of this data; correlations between malicious hosts were identified based on characteristics such as Operating System, targeted service, location and services running on the malicious hosts.

Deep neural networks have been successfully employed for this task, but, up to the authors' knowledge, they have never been used in an unsupervised scenario. This paper proposes an unsupervised method for diagnosing faults of electric motors by using a novelty detection approach based on deep autoencoders. In the proposed method, vibration signals are acquired by using accelerometers and processed to extract LogMel coefficients as features. Autoencoders are trained by using normal data only, i.e., data that do not contain faults. Three different autoencoders architectures have been evaluated: the multilayer perceptron (MLP) autoencoder, the convolutional neural network autoencoder, and the recurrent autoencoder composed of long short-term memory (LSTM) units. The experiments have been conducted by using a dataset created by the authors, and the proposed approaches have been compared to the one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) algorithm. The performance has been evaluated in terms area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve, and the results showed that all the autoencoder-based approaches outperform the OCSVM algorithm.

The challenge of intrusion detection is further complicated because, as advances are made in the ability to detect attacks, similar advances are made by adversaries to thwart those detective measures. Although numerous machine learning algorithms and approaches have proven effective in detecting cyberattacks, these algorithms have limitations, especially in dealing with adversarial environments. This study addresses the problem that there is not an effective machine learning algorithm that minimizes human interaction to train and evolve the learner to adapt to changing cyberattacks and evasive tactics. This research concludes that selective sampling of unlabeled data for classification by a human expert can result in more efficient labeling for large datasets and demonstrates a more resilient approach to machine learning that utilizes active learning to interact with human subject matter experts and that adapts to changing data, thus addressing issues related to data tampering and evasion.","1558-058X","978-1-5386-1539-3","10.1109/SECON.2017.7925383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7925383","machine learning;intrusion detection;random forest;active learning;k-means clustering;adversarial evasion;tampering;KDD-CUP 99","Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Computer crime;Classification algorithms;Computers;Neural networks","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","active learning intrusion detection;k-mean clustering selection;attack identification;cyberattack detection;Internet;machine learning algorithms;unlabeled data;human subject matter experts;data tampering;data evasion","","6","","23","","11 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike the traditional IDS for Internet, there are small number of known attack signatures for vehicle networks. Also, IDS for vehicle requires high accuracy because any false-positive error can seriously affect the safety of the driver. To solve this problem, we propose a novel IDS model for in-vehicle networks, GIDS (GAN based Intrusion Detection System) using deep-learning model, Generative Adversarial Nets.

However, recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are artificially designed perturbations in the original samples for misleading DNNs. Adversarial examples can be used to protect the DNN-based privacy leakage in mobile phones by replacing the photos with adversarial examples. To avoid affecting the normal use of photos, the adversarial examples need to be highly similar to original images. To handle a large number of photos stored in the devices at a proper time, the time efficiency of a method needs to be high enough. Previous methods cannot do well on both sides. In this article, we propose a broad class of selective gradient sign iterative algorithms to make adversarial examples useful in protecting the privacy of photos in IoT devices. By neglecting the unimportant image pixels in the iterative process of attacks according to the sort of first-order partial derivative, we control the optimization direction meticulously to reduce image distortions of adversarial examples without leveraging high time-consuming tricks.

We propose that by measuring the uncertainty of the model, annotation errors can be accurately corrected for classifying network traffic. We use dropout to approximate the prior distribution and calculate Mutual Information (MI) and Softmax Variance (SV) of the output. In this paper, we present a framework named Uncertainty Based Annotation Error Correction(UAEC) based on both MI and SV, whose accuracy outperforms other proposed methods. By modifying the labels of a public dataset, a real-life annotation scenario is simulated.

In previous work, some voltage-based methods to identify the sender node have been proposed. The methods can identify ECUs with high accuracy. However, the accuracy of source identification depends on a feature that is extracted from a continuous function of voltage use sampling. In general, as the sampling rate increases, the accuracy of identification is improved. Though the amount of data used for the identification increases too. Hence, it is desired to create an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that identifies ECUs using few sampling features as there is a limited computing resource in vehicles. In this paper, we propose a delay-time based sender identification method of ECUs.

Both misuse based IDS and anomaly based IDS are extensively researched in academia and industry. However, as critical infrastructures including smart grids (SG) may often face sophisticated unknown attacks in the near future, misuse based attack detection techniques will mostly miss their targets. Despite the fact that anomaly based IDS can detect novel attacks, they are not often deployed in industry, mainly owing to high false positive rate and lack of interpretability of trained models. With misuse based IDS' inability to detect unknown attacks and requirement for frequently manually crafting and updating signatures and with anomaly based IDS' bad reputation for high false alarm rate, specification based IDS can be regarded as the most suitable detection engine for cyber-physical systems (CPS) including SG. We argue that specification based IDS especially using rule learning could prove to be the most promising IDS for SG. Intrusion detection rules are learned through rule learning techniques and periodically automatically updated to accommodate dynamic system behaviors in SG. Fortunately, rule learning based IDS can not only detect previously unknown attacks but also achieve higher interpretability, due to symbolic representation of learned rules. It can thus be considered more “trustworthy” from human perspective and further assist human in the loop security operation. The present work provides a systematic and deep analysis of rule learning techniques and their suitability for IDS in SG. Besides, it concludes the most important criteria for learning intrusion detection rules and assessing their quality. This work serves not only as a guide to a number of important rule learning techniques but also as the first survey on their applications in IDS, which indicates their potential opportunities in SG security.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3071263","Helmholtz Association (HGF) through the Energy System Design (ESD) program and through the Competence Center for Applied Security Technology (KASTEL); KIT-Publication Fund of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9395457","Intrusion detection;interpretable machine learning;rule learning;data mining;smart grid","Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Protocols;Systematics;Smart grids;Deep learning;Cyber-physical systems","cyber-physical systems;learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;smart power grids","smart grids;SG;high false positive rate;IDS;intrusion detection rules;rule learning-based intrusion detection systems;cyber-physical systems","","","","121","CCBY","5 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, due to the openness of the wireless communication (e.g., DSRC), the integrity, confidentiality and availability of information resources are easy to be hacked by illegal access, which threatens the security of the related IoV applications. In this paper, we propose a novel Risk Prediction-Based Access Control model, named RPBAC, which assigns the access rights to a node by predicting the risk level. Considering the impact of limited training datasets on prediction accuracy, we first introduce the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in our risk prediction module. The GAN increases the items of training sets to train the Neural Network, which is used to predict the risk level of vehicles. In addition, focusing on the problem of pattern collapse and gradient disappearance in the traditional GAN, we develop a combined GAN based on Wasserstein distance, named WCGAN, to improve the convergence time of the training model. The simulation results show that the WCGAN has a faster convergence speed than the traditional GAN, and the datasets generated by WCGAN have a higher similarity with real datasets. Moreover, the Neural Network (NN) trained with the datasets generated by WCGAN and real datasets (NN-WCGAN) performs a faster speed of training, a higher prediction accuracy and a lower false negative rate than the Neural Network trained with the datasets generated by GAN and real datasets (NN-GAN), and the Neural Network trained with the real datasets (NN).

However, training data in many realworld applications exists a large imbalance between the majority class and the minority class inevitably to result in reducing the time series classification accuracy. Although a lot of existing solutions attempt to address the imbalanced learning problem, the synthetic samples based on the oversampling methods are short of diversity or variation to fail to accurately reveal the real minority class distribution. In order to create diverse artificial samples, a new oversampling method for imbalanced time series classification based on generative adversarial network (O-GAN) is proposed in this paper. An O-GAN application to imbalanced discharge voltage time series classification of lithium-ion cells is implemented. In addition, we selected 61177 cells with capacities between 2.06 Ah and 2.10 Ah as experimental samples. The samples are first preprocessed to obtain a labeled train set. For 1063 minority class samples, we use four oversampling methods to generate 1000 synthetic samples, respectively. Finally, the fully convolutional network (FCN) is considered as a discharge voltage time series classification algorithm to evaluate the oversampling methods. The results show that the proposed O-GAN method can effectively address the imbalanced time series classification problem.","","978-1-5386-8339-2","10.1109/CompComm.2018.8780808","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8780808","oversampling;imbalanced learning;time series classification;generative adversarial network","Time series analysis;Generative adversarial networks;Discharges (electric);Gallium nitride;Classification algorithms;Training;Generators","learning (artificial intelligence);mathematics computing;neural nets;pattern classification;sampling methods;time series","imbalanced discharge voltage time series classification;oversampling method;discharge voltage time series classification algorithm;imbalanced time series classification problem;generative adversarial network;time series classification algorithms;imbalanced learning problem;minority class distribution;minority class samples;synthetic samples","","1","","15","","1 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cyber-physical systems and supervisory control and data acquisition systems often embed algorithms for anomaly detection. Anomalies are, by definition, rare events and labor-intensive to identify. Pipelined deep learning techniques such as recurrent neural networks (RNN), 1-D convolution neural networks (1DCNN), and generative adversarial networks create unique anomaly detection architectures. These architectures are unsupervised, and labeled anomaly data is not required. With two large, multivariate time-series testbed experimental datasets, comparisons are made between the neural network architectures and traditional machine learning (TML) baseline techniques. Evaluation metrics appropriate for imbalanced anomaly datasets include the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the precision-recall tradeoff curve. Experimental results demonstrate that pipelined neural network architectures exhibit higher detection rates than the TML techniques. 1DCNN can substitute for RNNs when performance and long time-sequences are essential.","2475-1472","","10.1109/LSENS.2020.3007880","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9136901","Sensor networks;anomaly detection;convolutional neural network (CNN);industrial sensors;receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve;recurrent neural network (RNN);supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA);unsupervised learning","Computer architecture;Anomaly detection;Gallium nitride;Generative adversarial networks;Recurrent neural networks;Measurement;Artificial neural networks","convolutional neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);production engineering computing;recurrent neural nets;time series","industrial anomaly detection;unsupervised neural network architectures;efficient operation;secure operation;industrial equipment;integrated sensors;production process;cyber-physical systems;supervisory control;data acquisition systems;pipelined deep learning techniques;recurrent neural networks;1D convolution neural networks;1DCNN;generative adversarial networks;detection architectures;anomaly data;multivariate time-series testbed experimental datasets;traditional machine learning baseline techniques;imbalanced anomaly datasets;pipelined neural network architectures;higher detection rates","","2","","21","USGov","8 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite tremendous advances in compacting DNNs, few surveys summarize compacting-DNNs technologies, especially for IoT applications. Hence, this article presents a comprehensive study on compacting-DNNs technologies.

However, existing real-time APT detection mechanisms suffer from accuracy and efficiency issues due to inaccurate detection models and the growing size of provenance graphs. To address the accuracy issue, we propose a novel and accurate APT detection model that removes unnecessary phases and focuses on the remaining ones with improved definitions. To address the efficiency issue, we propose a state-based framework in which events are consumed as streams and each entity is represented in an FSA-like structure without storing historic data. Additionally, we reconstruct attack scenarios by storing just one in a thousand events in a database. Finally, we implement our design, called CONAN, on Windows and conduct comprehensive experiments under real-world scenarios to show that CONAN can accurately and efficiently detect all attacks within our evaluation. The memory usage and CPU efficiency of CONAN remain constant over time (1-10 MB of memory and hundreds of times faster than data generation), making CONAN a practical design for detecting both known and unknown APT attacks in real-world scenarios.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2020.2971484","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8979384","Advanced Persistent Threat;Hosted-based Security;Real-time Detection","Real-time systems;Malware;Security;Electronic mail;Computer science;Data mining;Semantics","","","","2","","","IEEE","3 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Cyber attackers have exploited the sophisticated features of SNSs to carry out harmful OSD activities, such as financial fraud, privacy threat, or sexual/labor exploitation. Therefore, it is critical to understand OSD and develop effective countermeasures against OSD for building trustworthy SNSs. In this paper, we conduct an extensive survey, covering 1) the multidisciplinary concept of social deception; 2) types of OSD attacks and their unique characteristics compared to other social network attacks and cybercrimes; 3) comprehensive defense mechanisms embracing prevention, detection, and response (or mitigation) against OSD attacks along with their pros and cons; 4) datasets/metrics used for validation and verification; and 5) legal and ethical concerns related to OSD research.

Alternatively, existing protocols are dependent on a secure communication channel during the registration phase. To address these concerns, an elliptic curve cryptography-based authentication protocol has been designed. Moreover, a secure key establishment is shown in this paper. Pseudo-id-based authentication is used to provide the privacy-preservation on the scheme. On the other hand, symmetric-key cryptography with a session key is used for message encryption during communication. A security analysis on the proposed scheme using the BAN logic and AVISPA shows the protocol’s resilience capabilities on various attacks. Alternatively, the mathematical proof of the protocol represents the proof of correctness.

To solve this problem, we propose an intelligent edge-chain-enabled access control framework with vehicle nodes and roadside units (RSUs) in this study. In our scenario, vehicle nodes act as lightweight nodes, whereas RUSs serve as full and edge nodes to provide access control services. Considering the low accuracy of risk prediction due to limited training sets, we leverage a generative adversarial networks (GANs) to convert the risk prediction to a sequence generation. Moreover, aiming at the problems of gradient disappearance and mode collapse existed in the original GANs, we devise a Wasserstein combined GANs (WCGANs). Simulation results demonstrate that WCGAN has higher prediction accuracy than the original GANs.

However, adversarial alterations of the sensor data can disrupt the occupants’ comfort or increase energy consumption. Several intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are proposed to detect the tempering of the sensor measurements. However, these approaches either demonstrate a high false alarm rate or fail to detect anomalies, putting the HVAC control or the building occupants in a vulnerable condition. This paper proposes a novel intrusion detection technique amalgamating two unsupervised machine learning techniques, namely autoencoder(AE) and one-class support vector machine (OCSVM), for identifying abnormality in smart building sensor measurements. Our experimental analysis shows that the AE model-based anomaly detector demonstrates satisfactory performance for lowering false alarms but fails to detect a number of anomalous samples. In contrast, the OCSVM-based anomaly detection model performs significantly well for anomaly detection while raises a lot of false alarms. Our proposed ensembled AE-OCSVM model combines both models’ benefits, resulting in significant reductions of false positive and false negative rates compared to the existing smart building IDSs.

Even worse, the network intrusion samples are submerged into a large number of normal data packets, which leads to insufficient samples for model training; therefore it is accompanied by high false detection rates. To address the challenge of unbalanced positive and negative learning samples, we propose using deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN), which allows features to be extracted directly from the rawdata, and then generates new training-sets by learning from the rawdata. Given the fact that the attack samples are usually intra-dependent time sequence data, we apply long short-term memory (LSTM) to automatically learn the features of network intrusion behaviors. However, it is hard to parallelize the learning/training of the LSTM network, since the LSTM algorithm depends on the result of the previous moment. To remove such dependency and enable intrusion detection in real time, we propose a simple recurrent unit based (SRU)-based model. The proposed model was verified by extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets KDD'99 and NSL-KDD, which effectively identifies normal and abnormal network activities. It achieves 99.73% accuracy on the KDD'99 dataset and 99.62% on the NSL-KDD dataset.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2922692","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2016YFB0800600); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872254,U1736212); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:YJ201727); Department of Science and Technology of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2018JY0913); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8736331","Network security;deep learning;intrusion detection system (IDS);simple recurrent unit;deep convolutional generative adversarial networks","Intrusion detection;Feature extraction;Deep learning;Training;Logic gates;Malware;Computer architecture","computer network security;convolutional neural nets;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;recurrent neural nets","intrusion behavior;high-dimensional data samples;network intrusion samples;normal data packets;model training;high false detection rates;unbalanced positive learning samples;negative learning samples;deep convolutional generative adversarial networks;DCGAN;rawdata;training-sets;attack samples;intra-dependent time sequence data;short-term memory;network intrusion behaviors;LSTM network;LSTM algorithm;abnormal network activities;intrusion detection system;complex time-varying;recurrent unit model;NSL-KDD dataset","","5","","37","OAPA","13 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the existing NIDSes for IoT systems are either too costly to scale or vulnerable against advanced attacks such as traffic mimicry. In this paper, we propose a novel IDS named Hawkware, a lightweight ANN-based distributed NIDS that runs on an IoT device and analyzes the device's runtime behavior in tandem with its network traffic. By analyzing device behavior, Hawkware is able to replace expensive, deep data analysis that has traditionally been used to detect advanced attacks. Our evaluations show that Hawkware is lightweight enough to be distributed and deployed on a Raspberry PI, and yet capable of detecting such attacks at a satisfactory level.","0738-100X","978-1-7281-1085-1","10.1109/DAC18072.2020.9218559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218559","Internet of Things;Security;Network Intrusion Detection;Artificial Neural Networks","Feature extraction;Payloads;Monitoring;Intrusion detection;Internet of Things;Runtime","data analysis;Internet of Things;neural nets;security of data","deep data analysis;advanced attacks;Hawkware;IoT device;network-based intrusion detection system;NIDS;IoT services;traffic mimicry;network traffic;device behavior;lightweight ANN;Internet of Things","","1","","19","","9 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
