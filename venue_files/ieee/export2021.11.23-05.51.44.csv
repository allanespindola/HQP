Now different types of intrusion traffic in the real network environment are imbalanced, which lead to poor recognition rate of classification models when dealing with rare attack types with few training samples. In order to solve the above problems, a new VAE-GAN model is proposed by combining VAE with GAN and optimizing the loss function to generate high-quality intrusion samples more efficiently and stably. In the training phase, original samples and generated samples are mixed as the input of classifiers. The experimental results show that the proposed VAE-GAN model has stronger stability and faster model convergence speed in the process of generating data. For small-sample data, the Recall and F1-score are significantly improved by using the generated samples of VAE-GAN model as the training set of classifiers.","","978-1-6654-2561-2","10.1109/BDACS53596.2021.00065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9516484","Intrusion detection;samples class imbalance;Generative Adversarial Network;Variational Auto-Encoder;Deep learning","Training;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Generative adversarial networks;Data models;Stability analysis;Security","computer network security;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","VAE-GAN model;faster model convergence speed;small-sample data;intrusion detection method;generative adversarial network;intrusion detection technology;network security research;intrusion traffic;network environment;recognition rate;classification models;rare attack types;training samples;high-quality intrusion samples;training phase;loss function;F1-score;variational autoencoder","","","","8","","23 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Their deployment in critical infrastructure have demonstrated a potential to transform the world. However, harnessing this potential is limited by their critical nature and the far reaching effects of cyber attacks on human, infrastructure and the environment. An attraction for cyber concerns in CPS rises from the process of sending information from sensors to actuators over the wireless communication medium, thereby widening the attack surface. Traditionally, CPS security has been investigated from the perspective of preventing intruders from gaining access to the system using cryptography and other access control techniques. Most research work have therefore focused on the detection of attacks in CPS. However, in a world of increasing adversaries, it is becoming more difficult to totally prevent CPS from adversarial attacks, hence the need to focus on making CPS resilient. Resilient CPS are designed to withstand disruptions and remain functional despite the operation of adversaries. One of the dominant methodologies explored for building resilient CPS is dependent on machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, rising from recent research in adversarial ML, we posit that ML algorithms for securing CPS must themselves be resilient. This article is therefore aimed at comprehensively surveying the interactions between resilient CPS using ML and resilient ML when applied in CPS. The paper concludes with a number of research trends and promising future research directions. Furthermore, with this article, readers can have a thorough understanding of recent advances on ML-based security and securing ML for CPS and countermeasures, as well as research trends in this active research area.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2020.3036778","USA NSF(grant numbers:CNS/SaTC 2039583,CNS 1650831,1828811); DoD Center of Excellence in AI and Machine Learning at Howard University(grant numbers:W911NF-20-2-0277); USA Army Research Laboratory; USA Department of Homeland Security(grant numbers:2017-ST-062-000003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9252851","Adversarial attacks;cybersecurity;machine learning;resiliency in cyber physical systems","Security;Computer security;Machine learning;Wireless sensor networks;Resilience;Sensor systems;Computers","authorisation;computer network security;cryptography;cyber-physical systems;learning (artificial intelligence);radiocommunication;telecommunication computing","machine learning security;securing machine learning;cyber attacks;CPS security;machine learning algorithms;networked cyber physical systems;wireless communication medium;cryptography;access control techniques;CPS attack detection;adversarial attacks;adversarial ML algorithm","","13","","193","IEEE","9 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The problem of unbalanced time series samples is common in industrial applications. The number of samples under normal conditions is much larger than that under abnormal conditions. In the electrolytic aluminum industry, this problem is even more serious, it is very difficult to find abnormal samples in industrial production because experts do not have a clear criterion to judge abnormalities. In traditional machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN), it is difficult to obtain high classification accuracy on the problem of class imbalance, and these methods tend to be more biased towards positive samples. In recent years, generative adversarial network (GAN) has become more and more popular in the field of anomaly detection. However, these methods need to find the best mapping from the actual space to the latent space in the anomaly detection stage, and the optimization process may bring new errors and take a long time. In this article, we use the ability of GAN to model complex high-dimensional image distribution, and propose a self-adaption AAE-GAN network based on adaptive changes of input samples. This time series anomaly detection method converts multi-dimensional time series data into a two-dimensional matrix, and only normal samples are needed in the training process, which effectively solves the above problems. The method we proposed is to use encoder and decoder to constitute a generator and a discriminator. During the training process, the generator and the discriminator are trained jointly and confrontationally, so that the mapping ability of the encoder can be fully reflected. In the anomaly detection stage, we determine whether the sample is abnormal according to the size of the reconstruction difference. Experimental results show that the detection accuracy and speed of this method are very high.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3097116","Yuyou Talent Support Plan of North China University of Technology(grant numbers:107051360019XN132/017); Fundamental Research Funds for Beijing Universities(grant numbers:110052971803/037); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9483933","Aluminum electrolytic cell;anomaly detection;AAE-GAN;multivariate time series;imbalanced industrial time series","Anomaly detection;Time series analysis;Aluminum;Production;Generative adversarial networks;Image reconstruction;Generators","","","","","","68","CCBY","14 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The field has been studied for a long time, with many techniques such as classical machine learning and deep learning methods currently available. However, the emergence of stronger encryption protocols has led to the rise of new challenges. One of the challenges is capturing and labeling a large amount of encrypted traffic data especially for training deep learning classifiers, as current techniques rely on deep packet inspection tools (DPI) which perform poorly on encrypted traffic. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning approach using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN). The basic idea is to utilize the samples generated by DCGAN generators as well as unlabeled data to improve the performance of a classifier trained on a few labeled samples. Thus, alleviating the difficulties associated with large dataset collecting and labeling. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we evaluated our model using a self-collected dataset of the recently established QUIC protocol as well as publicly available ISCX VPN-NonVPN dataset. Our approach is able to achieve 89% and 78% accuracy with a very small number of labeled samples (just 10% of the dataset) on both QUIC and ISCX VPN-NonVPN datasets respectively.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2962106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8941140","Deep convolutional generative adversarial network;encrypted traffic classification;semi-supervised learning","Generative adversarial networks;Deep learning;Generators;Payloads;Protocols;Encryption","computer network management;computer network security;cryptography;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;telecommunication traffic;virtual private networks","publicly available ISCX VPN-NonVPN dataset;dataset collecting;labeled samples;DCGAN generators;Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network;deep packet inspection tools;deep learning classifiers;encrypted traffic data;stronger encryption protocols;classical machine learning;Network traffic classification;deep convolutional generative adversarial networks;semisupervised encrypted traffic classification","","11","","23","CCBY","24 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Saad",Virginia Tech; Virginia Tech,"2019 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)","27 Feb 2020","2019","","","1","6","To reap the benefits of the Internet of Things (IoT), it is imperative to secure the system against cyber attacks in order to enable mission critical and real-time applications. To this end, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been widely used to detect anomalies caused by a cyber attacker in IoT systems. However, due to the large-scale nature of the IoT, its IDS must operate in a distributed manner with minimum dependence on a central controller. Moreover, in many scenarios such as health and financial applications, the IoT application datasets are private and IoT devices (IoTDs) may not intend to share such data. To this end, in this paper, a distributed generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed to provide a fully distributed IDS for the IoT so as to detect anomalous behavior without reliance on any centralized controller. In this architecture, every IoTD can monitor its own data as well as neighboring IoTDs to detect internal and external attacks. In addition, the proposed distributed IDS does not require any sharing of datasets among the IoTDs and, thus, it can be implemented in IoT applications that must preserve the privacy of user data such as health monitoring or financial applications. It is shown analytically that the proposed distributed GAN has higher accuracy of detecting intrusion compared to a standalone IDS that has access to only a single IoTD dataset. Simulation results show that the proposed distributed GAN-based IDS has up to 20% higher accuracy, 25% higher precision, and 60% lower false positive rate compared to a standalone GAN-based IDS.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9014102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9014102","","Gallium nitride;Generative adversarial networks;Generators;Monitoring;Intrusion detection;Internet of Things;Computer architecture","Internet of Things;neural nets;security of data","generative adversarial networks;cyber attacks;intrusion detection systems;IoT systems;IoT devices;IDS;Internet of Things;GAN","","12","","32","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve this, sports officials have turned to wireless sensor networks, or WSNs, in the form of helmet sensors that automatically report any harmful injuries to attendants on the sidelines. While this approach provides players with a greater assurance of safety and a faster response to their injuries, the security weaknesses of WSNs must be addressed. These systems, being not only recently developed but also highly resource-constrained, may be easily manipulated by those looking to gain information about players (a form of passive attack) or even attempting to remove them from the game through the sending of false reports (a form of active attack). To prevent attacks such as these, we propose a system that uses a modification of the AES-CCM protocol as well as a novel attack detection system that uses probabilistic methods to report any harmful behavior to the user. The system's power usage due to injury reports is compared to a probability model that is based on past research that recorded the likelihood of injury for the positions played in professional football. This system offers many advantages over conventional cryptography as it is a lightweight approach that costs few resources; individual helmet sensors need only send simple power reports to a central base station which uses on-the-grid power to conduct security analysis. Provided below is detail of the paper which describes the problem in greater detail, a section that details the system architecture, a section that explains the AES-CCM protocol, and an explanation of the probabilistic approach. This is followed by a security analysis that compares the approach to several other approaches found in the literature, and finally a conclusion.","","978-1-4799-5594-7","10.1109/ICWISE.2014.7042664","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7042664","security;wireless sensors;power analysis","Wireless sensor networks;Sensors;Cryptography;Protocols;Base stations;Injuries","biomedical communication;cryptographic protocols;injuries;patient monitoring;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","wireless sensor network security;health monitoring helmet;anomaly detection;power analysis;probabilistic model;helmet sensor;harmful injury report;passive attack;active attack;AES-CCM protocol;attack detection system;conventional cryptography;central base station;on-the-grid power;security analysis","","1","","21","","16 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is imperative that current network protocols be redesigned to prevent the retrieval of packet timing in a network and limit the ""networking"" information inferable from the timing. Timing information can be retrieved by adversaries both passive and active: active adversaries masquerade as network users and retrieve the timing of other legitimate users using delays experienced at shared schedulers, while passive adversaries utilize sophisticated snooping equipment to detect timing without actively participating in the network. In this article, a signal processing perspective is presented to study the protection against each kind of adversary, and a path to a unified solution to prevent timing analysis is discussed.

Traditional OS fingerprinting depends on banner grabbing schemes or network traffic analysis results to identify the system. These interactive procedures can be detected by intrusion detection systems (IDS) or fooled by fake network packets. In this paper, we propose a new OS fingerprinting mechanism in virtual machine hypervisors that adopt the memory de-duplication technique. Specifically, when multiple memory pages with the same contents occupy only one physical page, their reading and writing access delay will demonstrate some special properties. We use the accumulated access delay to the memory pages that are unique to some specific OS images to derive out whether or not our VM instance and the target VM are using the same OS. The experiment results on VMware ESXi hypervisor with both Windows and Ubuntu Linux OS images show the practicability of the attack.

However, insufficient preparation (e.g., lack of task context comprehension) may hinder the effectiveness of human involvement, especially when operators are unexpectedly interrupted to perform a new task. Preparatory notification of a task provided in advance can sometimes help human operators focus their attention on the forthcoming task and understand its context before task execution, hence improving effectiveness. Nevertheless, deciding when to use preparatory notification as a tactic is not obvious and entails considering different factors that include uncertainties induced by human operator behavior (who might ignore the notice message), human attributes (e.g., operator training level), and other information that refers to the state of the system and its environment. In this paper, informed by work in cognitive science on human attention and context management, we introduce a formal framework to reason about the usage of preparatory notifications in self-adaptive systems involving human operators. Our framework characterizes the effects of managing attention via task notification in terms of task context comprehension. We also build on our framework to develop an automated probabilistic reasoning technique able to determine when and in what form a preparatory notification tactic should be used to optimize system goals.

Hence, it is vital to call for further attention regarding security threats and corresponding defensive techniques of machine learning, which motivates a comprehensive survey in this paper. Until now, researchers from academia and industry have found out many security threats against a variety of learning algorithms, including naive Bayes, logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), principle component analysis, clustering, and prevailing deep neural networks. Thus, we revisit existing security threats and give a systematic survey on them from two aspects, the training phase and the testing/inferring phase. After that, we categorize current defensive techniques of machine learning into four groups: security assessment mechanisms, countermeasures in the training phase, those in the testing or inferring phase, data security, and privacy.

We use statistical techniques to create unique, reproducible device and device type signatures that represent time variant behavior in network traffic and use artificial neural networks (ANNs) to classify devices and device types. We demonstrate the efficacy of our technique on both an isolated testbed and a live campus network (during peak hours) using a corpus of 27 devices representing a wide range of device classes. We collected more than 100 GB of traffic captures for ANN training and classification. We assert that for any fingerprinting technique to be practical, it must be able to detect previously unseen devices (i.e., devices for which no stored signature is available) and must be able to withstand various attacks. GTID is the first fingerprinting technique to detect previously unseen devices and to illustrate its resilience under various attacker models. We measure the performance of GTID by considering accuracy, recall, and processing time and illustrate how it can be used to complement existing authentication systems and to detect counterfeit devices.","","978-1-4799-0895-0","10.1109/CNS.2013.6682720","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682720","GTID;Device Fingerprinting;Wireless Device Fingerprinting;Device Type Fingerprinting;Access Control","Wireless communication;Communication system security;Protocols;Object recognition;Security;Clocks;Vectors","neural nets;radiocommunication;statistical analysis;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security","passive technique;wireless device fingerprinting;wired-side observations;GTID fingerprinting technique;device heterogeneity;device hardware composition;device clock skew;statistical technique;device-type signature;time-variant behavior;network traffic;artificial neural networks;ANN classification;device classification;isolated testbed;live campus network;device class range;traffic captures;ANN training;attacker model;authentication systems;counterfeit device detection","","18","3","17","","12 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to aggregate the massive alert data effectively and identify important security events accurately, we propose an improved Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Techniques Algorithm based on Similarity Radius (SR-ISODATA). In the presented algorithm, optimal sequence comparison method is used to calculate the attribute weight of alert data, and different similarity calculation methods are chosen due to different properties of alert data; the merging and splitting criteria are revised, the clustering center in the original ISODATA algorithm is replaced by the average similarity radius and the distance calculation in the original algorithm is replaced by the similarity.

Nowadays, bots’ capability of emulating human behaviors has become increasingly sophisticated, making their detection harder. In this paper, we aim at recognizing bot-driven accounts by evaluating the consistency of users’ writing style over time. In particular, we leverage the intuition that while bots compose posts according to fairly deterministic processes, humans are influenced by subjective factors (e.g., emotions) that can alter their writing style. To verify this assumption, by using stylistic consistency indicators, we characterize the writing style of more than 12,000 among bot-driven and human-operated Twitter accounts and find that statistically significant differences can be observed between the different types of users. Thus, we evaluate the effectiveness of different machine learning (ML) algorithms based on stylistic consistency features in discerning between human-operated and bot-driven Twitter accounts and show that the experimented ML algorithms can achieve high performance (i.e., F-measure values up to 98%) in social bot detection tasks.","2637-9430","978-1-6654-1278-0","10.1109/ICCCN52240.2021.9522339","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9522339","Social bot;Stylometry;Bot detection","Measurement;Support vector machines;Machine learning algorithms;Social networking (online);Blogs;Machine learning;Writing","Internet;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online)","computer algorithms;social media;human behaviors;bot-driven accounts;stylistic consistency indicators;machine learning;stylistic consistency features;Twitter accounts;social bot detection tasks;writing style consistency","","","","57","","31 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By utilizing HTTP requests, malware easily disguises itself under a large amount of benign HTTP traffic. Thus, identifying malicious HTTP activities is challenging. We leverage an insight that cyber criminals are increasingly using dynamic malicious infrastructures with multiple servers to be efficient and anonymous in (i) malware distribution (using redirectors and exploit servers), (ii) control (using C&C servers) and (iii) monetization (using payment servers), and (iv) being robust against server takedowns (using multiple backups for each type of servers). Instead of focusing on detecting individual malicious domains, we propose a complementary approach to identify a group of closely related servers that are potentially involved in the same malware campaign, which we term as Associated Server Herd (ASH). Our solution, SMASH (Systematic Mining of Associated Server Herds), utilizes an unsupervised framework to infer malware ASHs by systematically mining the relations among all servers from multiple dimensions. We build a prototype system of SMASH and evaluate it with traces from a large ISP. The result shows that SMASH successfully infers a large number of previously undetected malicious servers and possible zero-day attacks, with low false positives. We believe the inferred ASHs provide a better global view of the attack campaign that may not be easily captured by detecting only individual servers.","1063-6927","978-1-4673-7214-5","10.1109/ICDCS.2015.70","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7164948","","Servers;Malware;Ash;IP networks;Silicon;Robustness;Communities","data mining;hypermedia;invasive software;network servers","malware campaign discovery;HTTP requests;HTTP traffic;malicious HTTP activities;cyber criminals;dynamic malicious infrastructures;malware distribution;SMASH;systematic mining of associated server herds;ISP;undetected malicious servers;zero-day attacks","","12","1","31","","23 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A common approach is to screen content in storage and transmission for exposed sensitive information. Such an approach usually requires the detection operation to be conducted in secrecy. However, this secrecy requirement is challenging to satisfy in practice, as detection servers may be compromised or outsourced. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving data-leak detection (DLD) solution to solve the issue where a special set of sensitive data digests is used in detection. The advantage of our method is that it enables the data owner to safely delegate the detection operation to a semihonest provider without revealing the sensitive data to the provider.

As a key problem in machine learning, how to design robust feature selection algorithms against these attacks becomes a hot issue. The current researches on defending evasion attacks mainly focus on wrapped adversarial feature selection algorithm, i.e., WAFS, which is dependent on the classification algorithms, and time cost is very high for large-scale data. Since mRMR (minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance) algorithm is one of the most popular filter algorithms for feature selection without considering any classifier during feature selection process. In this paper, we propose a novel adversary-aware feature selection algorithm under filter model based on mRMR, named FAFS. The algorithm, on the one hand, takes the correlation between a single feature and a label, and the redundancy between features into account; on the other hand, when selecting features, it not only considers the generalization ability in the absence of attack, but also the robustness under attack. The performance of four algorithms, i.e., mRMR, TWFS (Traditional Wrapped Feature Selection algorithm), WAFS, and FAFS is evaluated on spam filtering and PDF malicious detection in the Perfect Knowledge attack scenarios. The experiment results show that FAFS has a better performance under evasion attacks with less time complexity, and comparable classification accuracy.","2161-4407","978-1-5090-6014-6","10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489246","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8489246","adversarial feature selection;evasion attacks;filter model;mRMR","Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Security;Filtering algorithms;Machine learning algorithms;Training;Machine learning","computational complexity;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","popular filter algorithms;feature selection process;novel adversary-aware feature selection algorithm;Traditional Wrapped Feature Selection algorithm;Perfect Knowledge attack scenarios;evasion attacks;adversarial mRMR;machine learning;security sensitive applications;adversary attacks;robust feature selection algorithms;wrapped adversarial feature selection algorithm;classification algorithms;WAFS;FAFS;TWFS;time complexity","","1","","28","","14 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The general understanding seems to be that providing security in the sense of authenticated encryption for every (unidirectional) point-to-point link suffices to achieve this goal. As recently shown (in FSE17/ToSC17), however, the security properties of the unidirectional links do not extend, in general, to the bidirectional channel as a whole. Intuitively, the reason for this is that the increased interaction in bidirectional communication can be exploited by an adversary. The same applies, a fortiori, in a multi-party setting where several users operate concurrently and the communication develops in more directions. In the cryptographic literature, however, the targeted goals for group communication in terms of channel security are still unexplored. Applying the methodology of provable security, we fill this gap by defining exact (game-based) authenticity and confidentiality goals for broadcast communication, and showing how to achieve them. Importantly, our security notions also account for the causal dependencies between exchanged messages, thus naturally extending the bidirectional case where causal relationships are automatically captured by preserving the sending order. On the constructive side we propose a modular and yet efficient protocol that, assuming only point-to-point links between users, leverages (non-cryptographic) broadcast and standard cryptographic primitives to a full-fledged broadcast channel that provably meets the security notions we put forth.","2374-8303","978-1-5386-6680-7","10.1109/CSF.2018.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8429294","secure-channels,-broadcast-communication,-causality-preservation,-integrity,-confidentiality","Protocols;Servers;Reliability;Internet;Encryption","broadcast channels;broadcast communication;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;Internet","protocol;game-based authenticity;Internet;FSE17-ToSC17;point-to-point link;channel security;group communication;bidirectional communication;bidirectional channel;unidirectional links;security properties;authenticated encryption;confidential communication;authenticated communication;cryptographic channels;multiparty channels;full-fledged broadcast channel;standard cryptographic primitives;point-to-point links;broadcast communication;provable security","","","","40","","9 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Machine learning (ML) techniques are playing a vital role in numerous applications of cyber security. However, despite the ongoing success, there are significant challenges in ensuring the trustworthiness of ML systems. There are incentivized malicious adversaries present in the cyberspace that are willing to game and exploit such ML vulnerabilities. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges that ML techniques face in protecting cyberspace against attacks, by presenting a literature on ML techniques for cyber security including intrusion detection, spam detection, and malware detection on computer networks and mobile networks in the last decade. It also provides brief descriptions of each ML method, frequently used security datasets, essential ML tools, and evaluation metrics to evaluate a classification model. It finally discusses the challenges of using ML techniques in cyber security. This paper provides the latest extensive bibliography and the current trends of ML in cyber security.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3041951","Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9277523","Cyber security;deep learning;intrusion detection;malware;machine learning;spam","Computer crime;Machine learning;Internet;Deep learning;Market research;Malware;Intrusion detection","Internet;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing","security systems;unseen security attacks;polymorphic security attacks;machine learning;ML systems;cyberspace;cyber security;security datasets;intrusion detection;spam detection;malware detection;Internet;mobile applications","","17","","668","CCBY","2 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Corruption in these correlations has been shown effective in detecting false data injection attacks. In this paper, we adopt a new cross-correlation-based method to extract the sensor relationships. It utilizes the observed spatiotemporal (ST) and multivariate-attribute (MVA) sensor correlations to decide whether the sensor is subject to abnormalities or represents actual events. Based on the ST correlations, the cross-correlation is extracted in both space and time by conducting shape-based logical subclustering and two-phase analysis methods. In the first analysis phase, the system uses a variable-size sliding window and a median absolute deviation (MAD) measure. If the collected sensor data streams output a certain percentage of anomalous points, the MAD will flag these points as anomalous measurements, and all the sensor data and the window size will be passed to the second analysis phase. The latter performs both tumbling-window and sliding-window analyses to extract multicriteria cross-correlation measures. Finally, all the extracted sensor time-series features will be fed to the shape-based clustering to generate a sensor similarity-like graph. The latter reflects the similarity degree of the sensor with the other nodes. The nodes with a low similarity degree below the threshold will be identified as candidate abnormal nodes. Based on the observed MVA correlations, a set consisting of a few rules is introduced to check whether the detected candidate abnormal nodes represent actual events. Finally, if abnormal nodes exist, then such nodes are reported. Our experiments using two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach detects abnormal nodes with an average accuracy of 96.50%, an average precision of 88.69%, and a recall rate of 93.00%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115819","New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)(grant numbers:JPNP 16007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9548894","Anomaly detection;Internet of Things;sensor data correlations;wireless sensor networks;false data injection attacks","Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Correlation;Anomaly detection;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Intelligent sensors","correlation methods;pattern clustering;spatiotemporal phenomena;time series;wireless sensor networks","multicriteria cross-correlation measures;extracted sensor time-series features;sensor similarity-like graph;observed MVA correlations;detected candidate abnormal nodes;actual events;heterogeneous sensors;strong spatio-temporal correlations;abnormal node detection problem;wireless sensor network;false data injection attacks;cross-correlation-based method;sensor relationships;observed spatiotemporal;multivariate-attribute sensor correlations;ST correlations;shape-based logical subclustering;two-phase analysis methods;analysis phase;variable-size sliding window;median absolute deviation measure;MAD;collected sensor data streams output;anomalous points;anomalous measurements;window size;tumbling-window;sliding-window analyses","","","","33","CCBY","27 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, EK can do self-protection by imitating a benign website or responding to end-users with HTTP 404 error code whenever it encountered an unsupported target web browser. As a result, detecting EK requires a lot of effort. However, when an EK launches an attack, there are some patterns of interactions between a host and a victim. In this work, we obtain a set of data from www.malware-traffic-analysis.net and analyze those interactions in order to identify a set of features. We use such features to build a model for classifying interaction patterns of each EK type.

However, insider attacks may remain challenging to mitigate in CIDNs, as the intruders are able to control one or more internal nodes. Challenge- based trust mechanism is one promising solution to help safeguard CIDNs against common insider attacks, but not necessarily against advanced attacks such as passive message fingerprint attacks. In this work, we focus on challenge-based trust mechanism and advocate that considering additional level of trust can enhance the robustness of CIDNs. Specifically, we design an enhanced trust management scheme by checking spatial correlation among nodes' behavior, regarding forwarding delay, packet dropping and sending rate. Then, we evaluate our approach in a simulated environment, as well as a realworld environment in collaboration with an IT organization. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can help enhance the robustness of challenge-based trust mechanism by detecting malicious nodes faster than similar approaches (i.e., reducing time consumption by two to three days).","","978-1-7281-7534-8","10.1109/DSC49826.2021.9346232","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802077); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9346232","Collaborative Intrusion Detection;Spatial Correlation;Advanced Insider Threat;Challenge-based Trust Management;Trust Computation","Correlation;Collaboration;Intrusion detection;Organizations;Fingerprint recognition;Robustness;Trust management","computer network security;trusted computing","enhanced trust management scheme;spatial correlation;challenge-based collaborative intrusion detection;challenge-based trust mechanism;passive message fingerprint attacks;common insider attacks;internal nodes;CIDNs;collaborative intrusion detection networks;cyber-attacks","","","","43","","10 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There exists a critical gap between the time needed (demand) and the time available (limited analyst resource) for alert investigation at a CSOC. Hence, alert prioritization is important, for which CSOCs employ ad-hoc filtering methods to prune and triage the alerts that are presented to the analysts for investigation. One of the major drawbacks of the ad-hoc methods is that they do not comprehensively take into consideration the organization-specific factors such as mission and asset criticality, CSOC resource availability, demand variations, and the desired CSOC performance metrics. Hence, an ad-hoc triaging (or prioritization) method is insufficient, and an intelligent method for optimal selection of alerts that considers the above-mentioned organization-specific factors must be developed, which is described as a two-step process in this paper. First, a composite risk score of each alert is determined using a quantitative value function hierarchy process, which takes into account several organization-specific factors. Second, an optimization model selects a list of alerts for investigation that optimizes the CSOC performance metrics for a given demand subject to its resource constraints. Experimental results show that the alerts that pertain to mission criticalities are handled in a timelier manner as compared to current practices at the CSOCs. The average persistence time of an alert in the CSOC system is also shown to significantly reduce with this new approach, which is a paradigm shift in providing a stronger cyber-defense system by protecting the critical constituents of an organization.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2018.2886465","Army Research Office(grant numbers:Grants W911NF-13-1-0421,W911NF-15-1-0576); Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-15-1-2007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8573836","Alert prioritization;CSOC;optimization;quantitative value function hierarchy model;risk-score","Organizations;Optimization;Computational modeling;Mission critical systems;Analytical models;Measurement;Adaptation models","optimisation;risk analysis;security of data","organization-specific factors;CSOC performance metrics;Cyber Security Operations Center;cyber-defense system;optimization model;quantitative value function hierarchy process;CSOC system;optimal selection;ad-hoc triaging;CSOC resource availability;ad-hoc filtering methods;alert prioritization;alert investigation","","1","","45","IEEE","12 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We explore a new design methodology that allows us to reduce the asymptotic cost by a factor of O(log n) (where n denotes the input string length). In our experiments, we observe up to an order-of-magnitude savings in time and bandwidth compared to the best prior results. We extended our semi-honest protocols to work in the malicious model, which is by-far the most efficient actively-secure protocols for computing these string metrics.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2020.2984219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9054978","","Protocols;Security;Computational modeling;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Bandwidth","","","","","","","IEEE","2 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Given a trained classifier, a malicious attack may attempt to craft a data observation whereby the data features purposefully trigger the classifier to yield incorrect responses. This has been observed in various image classification tasks, including falsifying road sign detection and facial recognition, which could have severe consequences in real-world deployment. In this work, we investigate how these attacks could impact on network traffic analysis, and how a system could perform misclassification of common network attacks such as DDoS attacks. Using the CICIDS2017 data, we examine how vulnerable the data features used for intrusion detection are to perturbation attacks using FGSM adversarial examples. As a result, our method provides a defensive approach for assessing feature robustness that seeks to balance between classification accuracy whilst minimising the attack surface of the feature space.","","978-1-6654-2529-2","10.1109/CyberSA52016.2021.9478199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9478199","adversarial learning;machine learning;network traffic analysis","Perturbation methods;Roads;Face recognition;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Feature extraction;Denial-of-service attack","computer network security;face recognition;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic","adversarial machine learning attacks;adversarial attacks;malicious attack;image classification tasks;road sign detection;facial recognition;network traffic analysis;DDoS attacks;CICIDS2017 data;intrusion detection;perturbation attacks;FGSM adversarial examples","","","","31","","12 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cyber-attacks threaten the national security of every country and nation. Furthermore, cyber-attacks can significantly harm the economy. With the rapid and continuous growth of the cyber-universe, more software is being created, more data is being generated, and cybersecurity breaches and defense strategies are getting more complex. For such a problem, considering the size and complexity of the cyber-universe, big data mining techniques and advanced machine learning solutions will be most suitable to use for predicting brand-new attacks. This is because traditional machine learning methods would not help combat today's cybersecurity issues. Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems are receiving tremendous attention nowadays. This is because of the vast improvement and development in big data solutions. This paper utilizes highly imbalanced real-life benchmark network traffic datasets of multiple types of attacks. After resolving the class imbalance issue in our datasets by applying oversampling approach, our study becomes twofold. First, we are building prediction models for each type of attacks separately and optimizing the model with the highest accuracy. Then, we build a prediction model for all attacks together using deep learning with the smallest number of features and we optimize the model to achieve the highest accuracy. Our developed model can accurately predict the threat and the type of attack.","","978-1-5386-9276-9","10.1109/SSCI.2018.8628685","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8628685","Cybersecurity;Big Data;Stream Mining;Real-Time;Intrusion Detection;Deep Learning;High-Performance Computing Clusters (HPCC)","Computer security;Intrusion detection;Deep learning;Predictive models;Data mining;Biological system modeling","Big Data;computer crime;data mining;distributed processing;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation","prediction models;cyber-universe complexity;model optimization;real-life benchmark network traffic datasets;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;cybersecurity issues;advanced machine learning solutions;big data mining techniques;cybersecurity breaches;national security;cyber-attacks;distributed big data processing;taxonomy system;cyber intrusion prediction;deep learning;class imbalance issue","","4","","28","","31 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we have identified the limitations of the current techniques and propose a model for alert correlation that overcomes the shortcomings. An improved ""require/provide"" model is presented which established a cooperation between statistical and knowledge-based model, to achieve higher detection rate with the minimal false positives. A knowledge-based model with vulnerability and extensional conditions provide manageable and meaningful attack graphs. The proposed model has been implemented in real-time and has successfully generated security events on establishing a correlation between attack signatures. The system has been evaluated to detect one of the most serious multi-stage attacks in cyber crime -- SQLIA (SQL Injection Attack). Typical SQLIA steps are analyzed within the realm of simulated malicious activities normally used by cyber criminals. The system has efficiently established a correlation in attack behaviors and has generated an attack map. The map can be used to discretely analyze the correlated attack activities which in other case may go undetected thus facilitating the multi-stage attack recognition process.","2332-5658","978-1-61284-313-1","10.1109/AINA.2011.102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763386","Network intrusion detection systems;Alerts correlation;multi-stage attac;SQL Injection","Correlation;Knowledge based systems;Security;Mars;Real time systems;Probabilistic logic;Databases","security of data;SQL;statistical analysis","event based alert correlation system;SQLI activities;rule based mechanisms;statistical modeling;knowledge based model;attack signatures;cyber crime;SQL injection attack","","7","7","24","","5 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the rise of ubiquitous Machine Learning (ML) systems, malicious actors have been catching up quickly to find new ways to exploit ML vulnerabilities for profit. Recently developed adversarial ML techniques focus on computer vision and their applicability to network traffic is not straightforward: Network packets expose fewer features than an image, are sequential and impose several constraints on their features. We show that despite these completely different characteristics, adversarial samples can be generated reliably for RNNs. To understand a classifier's potential for misclassification, we extend existing explainability techniques and propose new ones, suitable particularly for sequential data. Applying them shows that already the first packets of a communication flow are of crucial importance and are likely to be targeted by attackers. Feature importance methods show that even relatively unimportant features can be effectively abused to generate adversarial samples. We thus introduce the concept of feature sensitivity which quantifies how much potential a feature has to cause misclassification. Since traditional evaluation metrics such as accuracy are not sufficient for quantifying the adversarial threat, we propose the Adversarial Robustness Score (ARS) for comparing IDSs and show that an adversarial training procedure can significantly and successfully reduce the attack surface.","","978-1-7281-7022-0","10.1109/BigDataService49289.2020.00030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9179605","adversarial machine learning;recurrent neural networks;interpretable machine learning;intrusion detection systems;feature importance","Robustness;Measurement;Feature extraction;Protocols;Training;Anomaly detection;Computer vision","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;recurrent neural nets","feature sensitivity;adversarial threat;IDS;adversarial training procedure;RNN;recurrent neural networks;intrusion detection systems;network data;ubiquitous machine;malicious actors;ML vulnerabilities;profit;adversarial ML techniques focus;computer vision;network traffic;network packets;completely different characteristics;adversarial samples;explainability techniques;sequential data;communication flow;feature importance methods;relatively unimportant features;adversarial robustness score","","1","","24","","28 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The nostalgics observed a parallel between the emerging paradigm of cloud computing and the traditional time-sharing era, depicting clouds as the modern reincarnation of mainframes available on a pay-per-use basis, and equipped with virtual, elastic, disks-asa-service that replace the old physical disks with quotas. This comparison is fascinating, but more importantly, in our opinion, it prepares the ground for constructive critiques regarding the security of such a computing paradigm and, especially, one of its key components: web services. In this paper we discuss our position about the current countermeasures (e.g., intrusion detection systems, anti-malware), developed to mitigate well-known web security threats. By reasoning on said affinities, we focus on the simple case study of anomaly-based approaches, which are employed in many modern protection tools, not just in intrusion detectors. We illustrate our position by the means of a simple running example and show that attacks against injection vulnerabilities, a widespread menace that is easily recognizable with ordinary anomaly-based checks, can be difficult to detect if web services are protected as they were regular web applications. Along this line, we concentrate on a few, critical hypotheses that demand particular attention. Although in this emerging landscape only a minority of threats qualify as novel, they could be difficult to recognize with the current countermeasures and thus can expose web services to new attacks. We conclude by proposing simple modifications to the current countermeasures to cope with the aforesaid security issues.","","978-0-615-51608-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5978790","Security;Web Services;Cloud Computing","Security;Cloud computing;Software;Debugging;Protocols;Programming","cloud computing;invasive software;Web services","Web services;security issues;security measures;information and communication technology;utility computing;cloud computing;intrusion detection systems;anti-malware;Web security threats;protection tools;injection vulnerabilities","","","","48","","8 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent efforts attempt to deal with this problem mostly by ensuring that well-known properties of analysis environments are replaced with realistic values, and that any instrumentation artifacts remain hidden. For sandboxes implemented using virtual machines, this can be achieved by scrubbing vendor-specific drivers, processes, BIOS versions, and other VM-revealing indicators, while more sophisticated sandboxes move away from emulation-based and virtualization-based systems towards bare-metal hosts. We observe that as the fidelity and transparency of dynamic malware analysis systems improves, malware authors can resort to other system characteristics that are indicative of artificial environments. We present a novel class of sandbox evasion techniques that exploit the ""wear and tear"" that inevitably occurs on real systems as a result of normal use. By moving beyond how realistic a system looks like, to how realistic its past use looks like, malware can effectively evade even sandboxes that do not expose any instrumentation indicators, including bare-metal systems. We investigate the feasibility of this evasion strategy by conducting a large-scale study of wear-and-tear artifacts collected from real user devices and publicly available malware analysis services. The results of our evaluation are alarming: using simple decision trees derived from the analyzed data, malware can determine that a system is an artificial environment and not a real user device with an accuracy of 92.86%. As a step towards defending against wear-and-tear malware evasion, we develop statistical models that capture a system's age and degree of use, which can be used to aid sandbox operators in creating system images that exhibit a realistic wear-and-tear state.","2375-1207","978-1-5090-5533-3","10.1109/SP.2017.42","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7958622","Malware Analysis;Sandbox;Evasion;Virtualization;Dynamic Analysis;Environment Aware Malware;Bare-metal Host","Malware;Tools;Security;Instruments;Companies;Virtual machining;Decision trees","data analysis;decision trees;invasive software;statistical analysis","spotless sandboxes;malware analysis systems;wear-and-tear artifacts;malware sandboxes;sandbox evasion techniques;decision trees;data analysis;statistical models","","13","","54","","26 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this method, the correlation among data is formulated in a hypergraph structure, where each vertex denotes one sample, and the connections (hyperedges) on the hypergraph represent the relation among samples in feature space. We introduce vertex weights to investigate the importance of different samples, where each vertex is initialized with a weight corresponding to its similarity score and isolation score. Then, we learn the label projection matrix for anomaly detection and optimize vertex weights simultaneously. In this way, the vertices with high weights play an important role during the learning process.

These methods, however, have two drawbacks: (i) they are not efficient since they use complex regular expressions as protocol signatures, and (ii) they require manual intervention to generate and maintain signatures, partly due to the signature complexity. In this paper, we present CUTE, an automatic traffic classification method, which relies on sets of weighted terms as protocol signatures. The key idea behind CUTE is an observation that, given appropriate weights, the occurrence of a specific term is more important than the relative location of terms in a flow. This observation is based on experimental evaluations as well as theoretical analysis, and leads to several key advantages over previous classification techniques: (i) CUTE is extremely faster than other classification schemes since matching flows with weighed terms is significantly faster than matching regular expressions; (ii) CUTE can classify network traffic using only the first few bytes of the flows in most cases; and (iii) Unlike most existing classification techniques, CUTE can be used to classify partial (or even slightly modified) flows. Even though CUTE replaces complex regular expressions with a set of simple terms, using theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations (based on two large packet traces from tier-one ISPs), we show that its accuracy is as good as or better than existing complex classification schemes, i.e. CUTE achieves precision and recall rates of more than 90%. Additionally, CUTE can successfully classify more than half of flows that other DPI methods fail to classify.","1095-2055","978-1-4673-1544-9","10.1109/ICCCN.2012.6289207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6289207","","Protocols;Payloads;Accuracy;Manuals;Training;Educational institutions","computer networks;pattern classification;protocols;telecommunication traffic","traffic classification using terms;deep packet inspection methods;DPI methods;protocol signatures;signature complexity;weighted terms;flow matching;regular expression matching;partial flow classification","","15","","24","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A sensor forward local state estimates to a remote estimator over a network, which may be eavesdropped by an intelligent adversary. Aiming at improving the eavesdropping performance efficiently, the adversary may adaptively alternate between an eavesdropping and an active mode. In contrast to eavesdropping, the active attack enables the adversary to sabotage the data transfer to the estimator, and improve the data reception to itself at the same time. However, launching active attacks may increase the risk of being detected. As a result, a tradeoff between eavesdropping performance and stealthiness arises. We present a generalized framework for active eavesdropping and propose a criterion based on the packet reception rate at the estimator to evaluate the stealthiness of the eavesdropper. Moreover, the tradeoff is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process. After deriving a sufficient condition under which at least one stationary policy satisfies the stealthiness constraint and also bounds the eavesdropping performance, we develop an optimal attack policy for the eavesdropper and focus on the structural analysis of the optimal policy.

SDN promises simplified network management by enabling network automation, fostering innovation through programmability, and decreasing CAPEX and OPEX by reducing costs and power consumption. In this paper, we aim at analyzing and categorizing a number of relevant research works toward realizing SDN promises.

Second, a time series which characterizes the activity level of each attack pattern is created over the observation period. Then, to extract the most prominent attack patterns, a clustering algorithm is engaged to cluster the attack patterns into groups that carry the similar activities in a long run, dimension reduction is employed to provide visual hints about their relationship.

In terms of intrusion detection, signature-based methods still occupy the dominant position together with anomaly-based methods that are deployed to be complementary. The anomaly-based methods are efficient and resource saving, however, anomaly-based RAT detection mainly utilizes machine learning on collective features without considering packet sequences. In addition, imbalanced data has a negative impact on machine learning classification. Accordingly, we analyzed packet sequences from various applications and found a general correlation between the packet direction sequences and the external control behaviors of RATs. This research presents a novel framework for tracking external control at the borders of area networks. We extract packet payload-size sequences, inter-arrival time sequences and packet direction sequences of IP flows. Then, RAT network behavior is exposed in the packet direction sequences of flow slices, which are generated by the inter-arrival time sequences. Naïve Bayes is utilized for classification, and a frequent sequence mining algorithm is implemented to eliminate noise. After deploying the device, we detected all the RAT sample sessions. Our method achieves a false positive rate of less than 0.6% on real-world campus network data, which demonstrates its efficacy.","","978-1-5090-6386-4","10.1109/ANCS.2017.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7966912","Traffic data analysis;Remote Access Trojan;External control","Rats;Trojan horses;Feature extraction;Protocols;Classification algorithms;Handwriting recognition","Bayes methods;data mining;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","remote access Trojans detection;area network borders;cyber-attacks;intrusion detection;signature-based methods;anomaly-based RAT detection;imbalanced data;machine learning classification;packet direction sequences;packet payload-size sequences;inter-arrival time sequences;IP flows;RAT network behavior;flow slices;naïve Bayes;frequent sequence mining algorithm","","3","","25","","3 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, we analyze the opportunities and challenges for hardware solutions in securing BACnet controllers in this work. First, we look into the security threats and develop practical attack models.

Intrusion detection system as the main research direction of cyber security has attracted much attention from industrial and academic area. The performance of traditional prior knowledge based methods is degraded significantly when the system is placed in the great variable environments. Machine Learning detection method, which depends on the neural network, has high flexibility in complex environments. The sample imbalance problem of intrusion detection dataset usually confuses the engineers and researchers. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection method which is focal loss based neural network to reduce the influence of sample imbalance problem. The focal loss pays more attention on the wrong predicted samples. In other words it shrinks the affects of well trained large sample categories in the total loss. In order to illustrate the performance of the proposed method, we implement two intrusion detection systems while training in different loss functions: cross entropy loss and focal loss. The experiment results show that the proposed method can effectively increase the detection performance of few sample categories.","1934-1768","978-9-8815-6390-3","10.23919/CCC50068.2020.9189108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9189108","Intrusion Detection;Neural Network;Sample Imbalance;Focal Loss","Neural networks;Intrusion detection;Training;Entropy;Computer security;Grippers;Propagation losses","entropy;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data","cyber intrusion detection method;focal loss neural network;cyber security;intrusion detection system;main research direction;industrial area;academic area;traditional prior knowledge;variable environments;complex environments;sample imbalance problem;intrusion detection dataset;wrong predicted samples;sample categories;loss functions;cross entropy loss;detection performance","","","","21","","9 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We developed a feature extraction method of employing the normalized term frequencies of codewords to characterize intra and inter packet attribute patterns hidden in actual TCP streams. A TCP stream is then transformed to a fixed length numeric feature vector. Supervised multi-class classifiers are built on the extracted feature vectors to differentiate different types of evasions from normal streams.

Data augmentation methods including the traditional oversampling techniques and the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based generation methods are most commonly used to counter the imbalance problem in NTC. However, the former is prone to overfitting and introducing noise. The latter overcomes the above weaknesses, but the quality of the generated traffic samples is difficult to judge. Besides, these methods all divide the imbalanced traffic classification problem into two subproblems, which cannot guarantee the global optimality. In this paper, we propose a GAN based Traffic Augmentation (TA-GAN) for imbalanced traffic classification. TA-GAN is an end-to-end framework that integrates the generation of the minority traffic samples with the training of the target classifier. We design the feedback mechanism to better guide the direction of the sample generation and simultaneously indicate the quality of the synthesized samples. Moreover, the existing deep learning-based NTC methods can be easily adapted to imbalance scenarios with TA-GAN. Comprehensive experiments on the public ISCXVPN2016 dataset demonstrate that TA-GAN effectively mitigates the influence of traffic imbalance (a maximum 14.64% improvement to the minority class' <tex>$F_{1}$</tex> score) and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.","2161-4407","978-1-6654-3900-8","10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9533942","The National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1006100,2020YFE0200500,2018YFB1800200); Key Research and Development Program for Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019B010137003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9533942","network traffic classification;imbalance;data augmentation;Generative Adversarial Network","Training;Degradation;Neural networks;Process control;Telecommunication traffic;Machine learning;Generative adversarial networks","","","","","","29","","20 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several versions of the problem are considered according to the available knowledge about the sources.

Existing anomaly detection solutions also do not provide an easy way to explain or identify attacks in the anomalous traffic. To address these limitations, we develop and present GEE, a framework for detecting and explaining anomalies in network traffic. GEE comprises of two components: (i)Variational Autoencoder (VAE)- an unsupervised deep-learning technique for detecting anomalies, and (ii)a gradient-based fingerprinting technique for explaining anomalies.

This article introduces the concept of covert attacks on autonomous vehicles which can jeopardize the safety of passengers. Covert attacks are designed to manipulate outputs of cyber physical systems through network channels in a way that while the changes are not easily perceptible by human beings, systems are negatively affected in the long run. We argue that future smart vehicles are vulnerable to viruses which can use adversarial learning methods to adapt themselves to hosts and remain stealth for a long period. As a case study, we design a covert attack on the lane keeping system of autonomous vehicles. In the scenario, an intelligent adversary manipulates sensor readings (lane position, curvature, etc.) in order to deceive the controller to drive the vehicle closer to the boundaries. The virus/attacker interactively learns the host vehicle behaviors in terms of lateral deviation and maneuverability and tries to increase the errors to the extent that remains unnoticeable to the driver. This process is carried out through actor-critic learning based on the Newton--Raphson method. We additionally design an intrusion detection system for such covert attacks. We use the GPS data and offline maps to reconstruct road curves and match them against readings. A simulation testbed is developed based on the map of Nurburgring-Grand Prix track to evaluate our models.

To address this issue, we present the design, analysis, and evaluation of opportunistic piggyback marking (OPM) for IP traceback in this paper. The OPM distinguishes itself from the existing works by decoupling the traceback message content encoding and delivery functions in MBT, and efficiently achieves expedited and robust traceback message delivery by exploiting piggyback marking opportunities. Based on the proposed OPM scheme, we then present the flexible marking-based traceback framework, which is a novel design paradigm for IP traceback and has several favorable features for practical deployment of IP traceback.

This requires the expansion of the air surveillance systems in order to be able to manage each one of these aircrafts. Such an accommodation is planned to be implemented using different technologies and notably the Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) system. The ADS-B protocol is based on the idea that aircrafts as well as air traffic controllers communicate with each other using messages. However, for practicality reasons, those messages are not encrypted thus malicious messages can be injected. Hence, these attacks need to be detected to ensure the safety of the protocol. In this paper, we evaluate deep learning architectures for the purpose of detecting anomalous/malicious ADS-B messages, especially LSTM architectures which appear to be the most promising ones.","2576-3555","978-1-7281-5953-9","10.1109/CoDIT49905.2020.9263880","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9263880","","Aircraft;Time series analysis;Surveillance;Anomaly detection;Aircraft navigation;Deep learning;Boosting","air traffic control;learning systems;surveillance","aircrafts;Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast system;air traffic controllers;malicious messages;deep learning architectures;LSTM architectures;anomalous ADS-B messages;air surveillance systems","","","","29","","27 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
