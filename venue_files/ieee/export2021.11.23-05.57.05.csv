At the same time, with the wide deployment of wireless local area network (WLAN) and general support of the IEEE 802.11 protocol by various mobile devices, the target intrusion sensing can be realized based on the existing WLAN infrastructure without requiring the target to carry any special device. However, the existing indoor WLAN target intrusion sensing approaches usually depend on the radio map construction with huge labor and time cost, which is the major barrier of current systems. In response to this compelling problem, we propose the new ray-aided generative adversarial model (RaGAM) to automatically construct the radio map, which is used for the indoor WLAN intelligent target intrusion sensing and localization. To achieve the low labor and time cost, the RaGAM uses the adaptive-depth ray tree based the quasi three-dimensional ray-tracing model to depict the difference of WLAN signals between the silence and intrusion environments with the purpose of constructing the synthetic radio map. Considering the gap between the synthetic and actual radio maps, we modify the conventional generative adversarial network by the joint synthetic and unsupervised learning (or called S+U learning) from the actual unlabeled received signal strength (RSS) data to improve the precision of the proposed ray-tracing model, and consequently obtain the refined radio map. After that, the statistical characteristics of the refined radio map are utilized to construct the training set for the probabilistic neural network (PNN), and then by using the well-trained PNN to classify the newly collected RSS data, the target intrusion sensing, and localization are achieved. The experimental results show that the proposed approach cannot only perform well in terms of computation cost and the ray-tracing accuracy, but also sense the target intrusion states accurately.","2471-285X","","10.1109/TETCI.2019.2892748","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771083,61704015); Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University(grant numbers:IRT1299); Fundamental Science and Frontier Technology Research Project of Chongqing(grant numbers:cstc2017jcyjAX0380); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8968712","Target intrusion sensing;ray-tracing;generative adversarial network;unsupervised learning;probabilistic neural network","Wireless LAN;Sensors;Ray tracing;Generative adversarial networks;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Adaptation models","indoor radio;neural nets;radionavigation;ray tracing;unsupervised learning;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 protocol;wireless local area network;indoor target intrusion sensing technique;ray-aided generative adversarial network;target intrusion states;refined radio map;ray-tracing model;conventional generative adversarial network;actual radio maps;synthetic radio map;intrusion environments;WLAN signals;quasithree-dimensional ray-tracing;indoor WLAN intelligent target intrusion sensing;ray-aided generative adversarial model;radio map construction;target intrusion sensing approaches","","1","","31","IEEE","24 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Newer variants of malware make it even tougher to detect them. The enormous amount of diversified malware enforced us to stumble on new techniques like machine learning. In this work, we propose an incremental malware detection model for meta-feature API and system call sequence. We represent the host behaviour using a sequence of API calls and system calls. For the creation of sequential system calls, we use NITRSCT (NITR System call Tracer) and for sequential API calls, we generate a list of anomaly scores for each API call sequence using Numenta Hierarchical Temporal Memory (N-HTM). We have converted the API call sequence into six meta-features that narrates its influence. We do the feature selection using a correlation matrix with a heatmap to select the best meta-features. An incremental malware detection model is proposed to decide the label of the binary executable under study. We classify malware samples into their respective types and demonstrated via a case study that, our proposed model can reduce the effort required in STS-Tool (Socio-Technical Security Tool) approach and Abuse case. Theoretical analysis and real-life experiments show that our model is efficient and achieves 95.2% accuracy. The detection speed of our proposed model is 0. 03s. We resolve the issue of limited precision and recall while detecting malware. User's requirement is also met by fixing the trade-off between accuracy and speed.","","978-83-955416-7-4","10.15439/2020F73","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222985","meta-feature;API call;system call;incremental malware detection;Abuse Case;STS-Tool","","application program interfaces;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","incremental malware detection model;meta-feature API;system call sequence;malware variants;diversified malware;sequential system;sequential API calls;meta-features;NITR system call tracer","","","","29","","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To enhance the detection performance of a single IDS, collaborative intrusion detection systems or networks (CIDSs or CIDNs) are often implemented in practical organizations, which encourage a set of IDS nodes to exchange information like alarms and signatures with each other. However, due to the distributed nature, malicious nodes within such collaborative network are able to generate untruthful signatures and share to others. This may significantly degrade the effectiveness and efficiency of detection. Recently, blockchain technology has received much attention from both academia and industry, which can provide a verifiable manner for distributed architectures without the need of a trusted intermediary. In this work, our motivation is thus to develop CBSigIDS, a generic framework of collaborative blockchained signature-based IDSs, which utilizes blockchains to help incrementally update a trusted signature database for different IDS nodes in a collaborative network. In the evaluation, our results show that blockchain technology can indeed help enhance the robustness and effectiveness of signature-based IDSs under adversarial scenarios via building a trusted signature database.","","978-1-5386-7975-3","10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8726642","Intrusion Detection Systems;Signature-based Approach;Collaborative and Distributed Network;Blockchain Technology;Insider Attacks;Generic Framework","Blockchain;Intrusion detection;Collaboration;Peer-to-peer computing;Monitoring;Databases;Computer architecture","digital signatures;security of data","alarms;distributed nature;malicious nodes;collaborative network;untruthful signatures;blockchain technology;CBSigIDS;trusted signature database;detection performance;single IDS;collaborative intrusion detection systems;security mechanisms;collaborative blockchained signature","","5","","51","","3 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, we study the interplay between the defender and the attacker when both of them try to do their best for pursuing their opposite goals. We focus our analysis on the metadetection of oracle attacks based on line search algorithms, as they are prevalent in the literature. In such scenario, we propose metadetectors, which work under very general conditions, that is, when the oracle is not exclusively fed with line search attacking queries, but only some of the malicious queries are made along the lines, whereas the others are done by mimicking the behavior of honest users. We theoretically evaluate the final achievable performance of these metadetectors, deriving conditions under which asymptotic powerful testing is possible.

Fast Entropy shows the significant reduce of computational time compared to conventional entropy computation while it maintains detection accuracy. However, Fast Entropy needs the manual threshold settings during detection process which is not realistic in real detection facility. We introduce adaptive detector with dynamic detection window size and adaptive threshold shifting using Fast Entropy, called AFEA (Adaptive DDoS attack detection using Fast Entropy Approach). Our adaptive DDoS detector successfully demonstrates that its performance of the DDoS detection can be enhanced by the best result of Fast Entropy detection scheme without manual threshold setting and system training while it maintains the same computational time of Fast Entropy detection scheme.

In this work, we present a statistical analysis of the impact of adversarial evasion attacks on various linear and non-linear classifiers, using a recently proposed Android malware classifier as a case study. We systematically explore the complete space of possible attacks varying in the adversary's knowledge about the classifier; our results show that it is possible to subvert linear classifiers (Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression) by perturbing only a few features of malicious apps, with more knowledgeable adversaries degrading the classifier's detection rate from 100% to 0% and a completely blind adversary able to lower it to 12%. We show non-linear classifiers (Random Forest and Neural Network) to be more resilient to these attacks. We conclude our study with recommendations for designing classifiers to be more robust to the attacks presented in our work.","","978-1-5386-1465-5","10.1109/NCA.2017.8171381","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8171381","","Feature extraction;Malware;Androids;Humanoid robots;Training data;Support vector machines;Training","invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;regression analysis;smart phones;support vector machines","adversarial evasion attacks;machine learning;android malware classifiers;Android-based devices;malicious apps;user devices;Android malware detection;linear classifiers;Support Vector Machines;nonlinear classifiers;Logistic Regression;Random Forest;Neural Network;statistical analysis","","6","","24","","11 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

State-of-the-art Internet of Things networks such as Nest also use open authentication (OAuth 2.0) protocols that are vulnerable to cross-site-recovery forgery (CSRF), which shows that these techniques may not prevent an adversary from copying or modeling the secret IDs or encryption keys using invasive, side channel, learning or software attacks. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs), on the other hand, can exploit manufacturing process variations to uniquely identify silicon chips which makes a PUF-based system extremely robust and secure at low cost, as it is practically impossible to replicate the same silicon characteristics across dies. Taking inspiration from human communication, which utilizes inherent variations in the voice signatures to identify a certain speaker, we present RF-PUF: a deep neural network-based framework that allows real-time authentication of wireless nodes, using the effects of inherent process variation on RF properties of the wireless transmitters (Tx), detected through in-situ machine learning at the receiver (Rx) end. The proposed method utilizes the already-existing asymmetric RF communication framework and does not require any additional circuitry for PUF generation or feature extraction. The burden of device identification is completely shifted to the gateway Rx, similar to the operation of a human listener's brain. Simulation results involving the process variations in a standard 65-nm technology node, and features such as local oscillator offset and I-Q imbalance detected with a neural network having 50 neurons in the hidden layer indicate that the framework can distinguish up to 4800 Tx(s) with an accuracy of 99.9% [≈99% for 10000 Tx(s)] under varying channel conditions, and without the need for traditional preambles.

In order to ensure better accuracy and stability, the ensemble paradigm can be exploited as an effective solution for combining such techniques. However, as attack detection problems are hard to cope with and, usually, entail the analysis of large and fast streams of data, different types of ensemble (and of base algorithms composing the ensemble) should have experimented, exploiting distributed architecture to suitably reduce the high-execution times necessary to run them. In order to handle all these issues, a p2p environment to validate ensemble-based approaches in the cybersecurity domain is proposed in this paper.

In particular, TMQ makes use of several sources of information to quantify the individual threat vectors. First, TMQ utilizes the smart grid network topology and global security access control policies to create a state-based security model for the smart grid using the Markov decision processes formalism. Then, TMQ utilizes traditional descriptive threat models, historical attack reports, intrusion detection logs as well as reports/interviews by/with hackers to quantify adversarial viewpoints of attackers from various threat categories against the smart grid. The result is an automatically generated model with specialized reward functions for each category of attackers.

First, we build the Bayesian attack-defense evolutionary game model combining with incomplete information game scenario. Specifically, we convert the uncertainty of the strategy payoffs of attackers and defenders to the uncertainty of their related types. Meanwhile, both the set of player types and the set of game strategies can be expanded to n in our model. Furthermore, we improve the replicator dynamics equation by adding the selecting intensity factor to depict the noise effect. This reflects the randomness of decision making for players due to their bounded learning capacities. In this way, the static analysis in the traditional game is extended as a dynamic process. On this basis, we summarize the evolutions of different player types with different strategies. Finally, by calculating the evolutionary stable equilibrium, we give the algorithm of selecting optimal defense strategy and depict the evolutionary track of this strategy selected by the defender with time going by. Our method provides decision support for the network proactive defense toward moderate security.

We propose an enhanced PeerHunter, a network-flow level community behavior analysis based system, to detect P2P botnets. Our system starts from a P2P network flow detection component. Then, it uses “mutual contacts” to cluster bots into communities. Finally, it uses network-flow level community behavior analysis to detect potential botnets. In the experimental evaluation, we propose two evasion attacks, where we assume the adversaries know our techniques in advance and attempt to evade our system by making the P2P bots mimic the behavior of legitimate P2P applications. Our results showed that enhanced PeerHunter can obtain high detection rate with few false positives, and high robustness against the proposed attacks.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2018.2881657","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8536452","P2P botnet;intrusion detection;network security;community detection","Botnet;Peer-to-peer computing;Payloads;Cryptography;Feature extraction;Indexes;Machine learning algorithms","computer network security;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing;security of data","enhanced PeerHunter;centralized botnets;network security;peer-to-peer botnets;legitimate P2P applications;P2P network flow detection component;network-flow level community behavior analysis based system","","7","","35","IEEE","15 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Various types of cyber-security enabled mechanisms have been developed to limit these concerns. Anomaly detection is among these mechanisms. Anomaly detection means using multiple techniques and methods to detect different patterns that do not conform to defined features of whole data. Recently, deep learning techniques adopted as a satisfactory solution because of its ability to extract data features from data itself. Convolution neural network (CNN) is mainly utilized because of its ability to process input with multi-dimensions. In this paper, a comprehensive survey about using CNN as a key solution for anomaly detection is provided. Most of the existing solutions in the literature have been gathered and classified according to the input data source; furthermore, this paper suggests a unified cross framework that simulates end-to-end anomaly detection mechanisms that exist in the previous studies. A unified cross framework enriches this paper with in-depth analysis to clarify how the solution in the literature uses CNN in anomaly detection.

First, instead of using a conventional autoencoder, we propose a transformation invariant autoencoder to do better representation learning for complex image datasets. Next, to mitigate the negative effect of noise introduced by outliers and stabilize the network training, we select the most confident inliers likely examples in each epoch as the training set by incorporating adaptive self-paced learning in our TIAE framework.

Traditional methods so far have categorized anomaly detection into (a) unsupervised, (b) semi-supervised and (c) supervised techniques. A relatively unexplored direction is the development of context aware anomaly detection systems which can build on top of any of these three techniques by using side information. Context can be captured from a different modality such as semantic graphs encoding grouping of sensors governed by the physics of the asset. Process flow diagrams of an operational plant depicting causal relationships between sensors can also provide useful context for ML algorithms. Capturing such semantics by itself can be pretty challenging, however, our paper mainly focuses on, (a) designing and implementing effective anomaly detection pipelines using sparse Gaussian Graphical Models with various statistical distance metrics, and (b) differentiating these pipelines by embedding contextual semantics inferred from graphs so as to obtain better KPIs in practice. The motivation for the latter of these two has been explained above, and the former in particular is well motivated by the relatively mediocre performance of highly parametric deep learning methods for small tabular datasets (compared to images) such as IoT sensor data. In contrast to such traditional automated deep learning (AutoAI) techniques, our anomaly detection system is based on developing semantics-driven industry specific ML pipelines which perform scalable computation evaluating several models to identify the best model. We benchmark our AD method against state-of-the-art AD techniques on publicly available UCI datasets. We also conduct a case study on IoT sensor and semantic data procured from a large thermal energy asset to evaluate the importance of semantics in enhancing our pipelines. In addition, we also provide explainable insights for our model which provide a complete perspective to a reliability engineer.","","978-1-7281-6251-5","10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9377767","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9377767","anomaly detection;semantics;Internet-of-Things","Industries;Deep learning;Context-aware services;Computational modeling;Semantics;Pipelines;Anomaly detection","deep learning (artificial intelligence);Gaussian processes;graph theory;Internet of Things;security of data;supervised learning;ubiquitous computing;unsupervised learning","relatively unexplored direction;semantic graphs;sparse Gaussian graphical models;contextual semantics;relatively mediocre performance;highly parametric deep learning methods;IoT sensor data;automated deep learning techniques;semantics-driven industry specific ML pipelines;semantic data;end-to-end context aware anomaly detection system;statistical distance metrics;publicly available UCI datasets;large thermal energy asset;AD method;KPIs;process flow diagrams;supervised techniques;unsupervised techniques;semisupervised techniques","","","","29","","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, not all of these contributions have resonated widely within aviation circles. At the same time, the security community lacks certain aviation domain knowledge, preventing aviation authorities from giving credence to their findings. In this survey, we aim to reconcile the view of the security community and the perspective of aviation professionals concerning the safety of air traffic communication technologies. To achieve this, we first provide a systematization of the applications of wireless technologies upon which civil aviation relies. Based on these applications, we comprehensively analyze vulnerabilities and existing attacks. We further survey the existing research on countermeasures and categorize it into approaches that are applicable in the short term and research of secure new technologies deployable in the long term. Since not all of the required aviation knowledge is codified in academic publications, we additionally examine the existing aviation standards and survey 242 international aviation experts.

The conflict between cybersecurity requirements and the computing capabilities of embedded systems makes it critical to implement sophisticated security countermeasures against cyber-attacks in an embedded system with limited resources, without draining those resources. In this study, twelve factors influencing CSES have been identified: (1) the components; (2) the characteristics; (3) the implementation; (4) the technical domain; (5) the security requirements; (6) the security problems; (7) the connectivity protocols; (8) the attack surfaces; (9) the impact of the cyber-attacks; (10) the security challenges of the ESs; (11) the security solutions; and (12) the players (manufacturers, legislators, operators, and users).

This will enable cybersecurity practitioners to conduct an assessment of their systems with regard to twelve identified cybersecurity aspects. In MuLFESC, the feedback from the system-components layer to the system-operations layer could help implement “Security by Design” in the design stage at the bottom layer.

We primarily define and characterize darknet and indicate its alternative names. We further list other trap-based monitoring systems and compare them to darknet. Moreover, in order to provide realistic measures and analysis of darknet information, we report case studies, namely, Conficker worm in 2008 and 2009, Sality SIP scan botnet in 2011, and the largest amplification attack in 2014. Finally, we provide a taxonomy in relation to darknet technologies and identify research gaps that are related to three main darknet categories: deployment, traffic analysis, and visualization. Darknet projects are found to monitor various cyber threat activities and are distributed in one third of the global Internet. We further identify that Honeyd is probably the most practical tool to implement darknet sensors, and future deployment of darknet will include mobile-based VOIP technology. In addition, as far as darknet analysis is considered, computer worms and scanning activities are found to be the most common threats that can be investigated throughout darknet; Code Red and Slammer/Sapphire are the most analyzed worms. Furthermore, our study uncovers various lacks in darknet research. For instance, less than 1% of the contributions tackled distributed reflection denial of service (DRDoS) amplification investigations, and at most 2% of research works pinpointed spoofing activities.

The problem occurs when the generator learns to map several various input values (z) to the same output value, which makes the generator fail to capture all modes of the true data distribution. As a result, the diversity of synthetically produced data is lower than that of the real data. To address this problem, we propose a new and simple framework for training GANs based on the concept of virtual mapping. Our framework integrates two processes into GANs: merge and split. The merge process merges multiple data points (samples) into one before training the discriminator. In this way, the generator would be trained to capture the merged-data distribution rather than the (unmerged) data distribution. After the training, the split process is applied to the generator's output in order to split its contents and produce diverse modes. The proposed framework increases the chance of capturing diverse modes through enabling an indirect or virtual mapping between an input z value and multiple data points. This, in turn, enhances the chance of generating more diverse modes. Our results show the effectiveness of our framework compared to the existing approaches in terms of reducing the mode collapse problem.","2161-4407","978-1-6654-3900-8","10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9533656","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9533656","","Training;Neural networks;Generative adversarial networks;Generators","","","","","","28","","20 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Instinctive resources constraint also prevent devices from deploying expensive cryptography and enabling secure operation modes. In this paper, we propose a dynamic threshold mechanism, called DTM, to mitigate DAO inconsistency attack in RPL-based LLNs, where a malicious node intentionally drops the received data packet and replies the forwarding error packet to cause the parent node to discard valid downward routes in the routing table. In the DTM, each parent node dynamically adjusts the threshold of accepting forwarding error packets within a time period based on the number of received forwarding error packets as well as the estimated normal forwarding error rate to counter DAO inconsistency attack. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme can provide higher packet delivery ratio but lower energy consumption compared to the fixed threshold scheme.","","978-1-5386-4649-6","10.1109/CCWC.2018.8301614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8301614","Forwarding misbehavior;DAO inconsistency attack;RPL;low power and lossy networks","Routing;Energy consumption;Routing protocols;Error analysis;Wireless sensor networks;Cryptography","cryptography;data protection;radio networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","shared medium;physical protection;LLNs;expensive cryptography;dynamic threshold mechanism;malicious node;received data packet;parent node;routing table;received forwarding error packets;estimated normal forwarding error rate;DTM;packet delivery ratio;DAO inconsistency attack mitigation;instinctive resource constraint;secure operation modes;downward routes;RPL-based low power and lossy networks;energy consumption","","10","","20","","26 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the major objectives in VANET is maintaining the availability of the system. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is one of the most popular attack types aiming at the availability of system. We consider the timely detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks to RSU in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). A novel framework for detecting and mitigating low-rate DDoS attacks in ITS based on nonparametric statistical anomaly detection is proposed. Dealing with low-rate DDoS attacks is challenging since they can bypass traditional data filtering techniques while threatening the RSU availability due to their highly distributed nature. Extensive simulation results are presented for a real road scenario with the help of the SUMO traffic simulation software. The results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms two parametric methods for timely detection based on the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) test, as well as the traditional data filtering approach in terms of average detection delay and false alarm rate.","2153-0017","978-1-7281-0323-5","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569698","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569698","","Computer crime;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Roads;Anomaly detection;Safety;Accidents","computer network security;intelligent transportation systems;vehicular ad hoc networks","secure communication concerns;VANET;Intelligent Transportation Systems;nonparametric statistical anomaly detection;RSU availability;average detection delay;vehicular network;ad-hoc network;communication infrastructure;road side units;Distributed Denial of Service attack;low-rate DDoS attacks;real-time detection;DDoS attacks;data filtering techniques;cumulative sum test;CUSUM test;SUMO traffic simulation software","","6","","25","","9 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Homomorphic encryption ensures the biometric payload is always one-way encrypted with no need for key management and provides full privacy by ensuring plaintext biometrics are never received by the SBP server. The SBP implementation includes software running on a client device and on the SPB server. Pluggable components are used to replace legacy functionality to allow rapid integration into existing operating environments. The SBP implementation allows the systems to meet security needs by using the application programming interface, whether the underlying system is a relational database management system or a search engine. The SBP implementation functionality offers a “point-and-cut” mechanism to add the appropriate security to the production systems as well as to the systems in development.

The collected data can be information associated with a car accident, the congested highway ahead, parked car, etc. This information exchanged with other neighboring vehicles on the road to promote safe driving. IoV networks are vulnerable to various security attacks. The V2V communication comprises specific vulnerabilities which can be manipulated by attackers to compromise the whole network.

It is common knowledge in the research community that IDSs have problems accurately identifying attacks. In this paper we discuss this accuracy problem and decompose it into a detection problem and a confirmation problem. We then map the evaluation of this accuracy problem to the traditional software verification and validation problem, which allows us to analyze the techniques academics have been using to evaluate their IDS technologies.

Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication of VANET can guarantee traffic system management and road safety. However, V2V communication cannot manage many vehicles as a whole, so it needs to be segmented and communicated by region. Therefore, considering locality, key agreement is made for V2V communication of the same or different regions. Moreover, traditional public key infrastructure (PKI) and Kerberos systems to be applied in a real environment incur computational overhead. Therefore, we proposed a lightweight protocol for dynamic properties of vehicles for regional segmentation management and overhead resolution. In addition, because vehicle information is transmitted through public channels, our protocol uses mutual authentication and honey_list technology to ensure security against a variety of attacks. It provides verification of safety through a detailed security analysis using the formal analysis using the widely-accepted Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, and verifies formal security using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) software tool and non-mathematical (informal) security analysis.

In swarm robotics, a self-organized cooperation is applied, where robots with limited intelligence cooperate and interact locally to build up the desired global behavior. In this paper, we are studying a mobile object tracking scenario performed by a swarm of robots. The robustness, scalability and flexibility of swarm robots make it an attractive approach for missions like object tracking in complex and dynamic environments. As the individual robot capabilities are limited in swarm systems, the robots may not be able to track the mobile object continuously. This limitation is overcome using the robots communication capability. In order to increase the probability of object detection, we propose a greedy self-deployment strategy, where the robots are spread uniformly in the environment to be monitored. For detecting a moving target, the robots use a biologically inspired algorithm for collecting robots currently located in other regions to track the target. In such cooperative tasks the robots normally need to be time synchronized for simultaneous activation. A new proposal for time synchronization in swarm robots is introduced which exploits the mobility of the robots for handling possible disconnections in the network and synchronize them at the beginning of tracking time slots.","","978-1-4577-0303-4","10.1109/ISORCW.2011.30","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5753531","swarm robots;object tracking;time synchronization;motion control","Robot sensing systems;Synchronization;Tracking;Robot kinematics;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","cooperative systems;mobile robots;motion control;multi-robot systems;object detection;object tracking;robot vision;self-adjusting systems;target tracking","self-organized cooperation;swarm robotics;multirobot system;robustness;mobile object tracking;object detection;greedy self-deployment strategy;moving target detection;biologically inspired algorithm;target tracking;cooperative task;time synchronization","","3","1","30","","21 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we present Mitch, the first machine learning solution for the black-box detection of CSRF vulnerabilities. At the core of Mitch there is an automated detector of sensitive HTTP requests, i.e., requests which require protection against CSRF for security reasons. We trained the detector using supervised learning techniques on a dataset of 5,828 HTTP requests collected on popular websites, which we make available to other security researchers. Our solution outperforms existing detection heuristics proposed in the literature, allowing us to identify 35 new CSRF vulnerabilities on 20 major websites and 3 previously undetected CSRF vulnerabilities on production software already analyzed using a state-of-the-art tool.","","978-1-7281-1148-3","10.1109/EuroSP.2019.00045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8806728","Cross site request forgery;Machine learning;Web security","Security;Tools;Browsers;Forgery;Machine learning;Manuals;Task analysis","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","black-box detection;machine learning solution;sensitive HTTP requests;supervised learning techniques;cross-site request forgery;HTTP requests;CSRF vulnerabilities;Mitch approach;machine learning approach;supervised learning technique","","3","","38","","22 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The framework has a hybrid design that combines an autoencoder, a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) layer, and a Deep Neural Network (DNN). This data-driven framework considers the temporal behavior of a generic physical system that extracts features from the time series of the sensor measurements that can be used for detecting covert attacks, distinguishing them from equipment faults, as well as localize the attack/fault.

This paper presents a method to create intrusion databases, which aims at mimicking the production environments characteristics by using well-known tools. Moreover, we present and evaluate a new validation technique, which aims at ensuring the generalization capacity of the obtained models, reached using cross-validating with different intrusion databases. The evaluation tests showed the feasibility of the proposed method. The feature selection technique ensured the model generalization capacity, improving its accuracy rate by 13%, while testing in different intrusion databases. Finally, the proposed anomaly-based approach was compared with Snort, reaching an accuracy rate of 99% against 27% of Snort for detecting DoS attacks.","1530-1346","978-1-5386-6950-1","10.1109/ISCC.2018.8538524","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8538524","Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection;Model Generalization;Machine Learning;Genetic Algorithm","Computers;Protocols;Computational modeling;Databases;Feature extraction;Standards;Intrusion detection","computer network security;database management systems;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","machine learning techniques;classifier development process;nonrepresentative training databases;validation technique;feature selection technique;model generalization capacity;intrusion databases;anomaly-based intrusion detection;production environment characteristics","","1","","22","","18 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thanks to the outsourcing paradigm, CC is enabling many services. Software as a Service (SaaS) is one of those cloud-based-services. Indeed, SaaS model allows providers to reduce the cost of maintenance and management by transferring traditional on premise deployment to public Cloud. Clients can subscribe, in self-service, to SaaS services based on a pay-per-use model. However, since user data are outsourced to the Cloud, serious security breaches are rising and could harm the reputation of providers and slow down the subscription of clients. SQL injection attack (SQLIA) is one of the most critical SaaS vulnerabilities that allows attackers to violate the availability, confidentiality and integrity of user data. In this paper, we propose SQL injection intrusion detection framework as a service for SaaS providers, SQLIIDaaS, which allows a SaaS provider to detect SQLIAs targeting several SaaS applications without reading, analyzing or modifying the source code. To achieve SQL query/HTTP request mapping, we propose an event correlation based on the similarity between literals in SQL queries and parameters in HTTP requests. SQLIIDaaS is integrated and validated in Amazon Web Services (AWS). A SaaS provider can subscribe to this framework and launch its own set of virtual machines, which holds on-demand self-service, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service properties.","","978-1-5090-6644-5","10.1109/CSCloud.2017.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7987193","Software as a Service;HTTP Request;SQL Query;SQL Injection Attack;Amazon Web Services","Structured Query Language;Software as a service;Cloud computing;Correlation;Intrusion detection;Maintenance engineering","cloud computing;computer network security;cost reduction;data integrity;hypermedia;outsourcing;resource allocation;security of data;SQL;virtual machines;Web services","SQLIIDaaS;SQL injection intrusion detection framework;SaaS providers;cloud computing;Internet-based-platform;software as a service;cloud-based-services;maintenance cost reduction;management cost reduction;pay-per-use model;user data outsourcing;security breaches;client subscription;SQL injection attack;SQLIA;SaaS vulnerabilities;user data integrity;user data confidentiality;SQL query;HTTP request mapping;event correlation;Amazon Web services;AWS;virtual machines;on-demand self-service;resource pooling;rapid elasticity","","1","","31","","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some works conducted over the last years have pointed out that such algorithms are generally susceptible to deception, notably in the form of attacks carefully constructed to evade detection. Various learning schemes have been proposed to overcome this weakness. One such system is Keyed IDS (KIDS), introduced at DIMVA “10. KIDS” core idea is akin to the functioning of some cryptographic primitives, namely to introduce a secret element (the key) into the scheme so that some operations are infeasible without knowing it. In KIDS the learned model and the computation of the anomaly score are both key-dependent, a fact which presumably prevents an attacker from creating evasion attacks. In this work we show that recovering the key is extremely simple provided that the attacker can interact with KIDS and get feedback about probing requests. We present realistic attacks for two different adversarial settings and show that recovering the key requires only a small amount of queries, which indicates that KIDS does not meet the claimed security properties. We finally revisit KIDS' central idea and provide heuristic arguments about its suitability and limitations.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2013.39","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6598669","Adversarial classification;anomaly detection;intrusion detection systems;secure machine learning","Payloads;Training;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","key-recovery attacks;keyed anomaly detection system;KIDS;anomaly detection systems;machine learning algorithms;evasion attacks","","14","","23","IEEE","13 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In practice, however, this assumption is unreliable in the unsupervised case, where the training data may contain anomalous examples. Given sufficient capacity and training time, an AE can generalize to such an extent that it reliably reconstructs anomalies. Consequently, the ability to distinguish anomalies via reconstruction errors is diminished. We respond to this limitation by introducing three new methods to more reliably train AEs for unsupervised anomaly detection: cumulative error scoring (CES), percentile loss (PL), and early stopping via knee detection.

However, in the real world, malicious agents may exist and provide false advice to hinder the learning performance of other agents. The second limitation is that the analysis of communication overhead in these approaches is either overlooked or simplified. However, in communication-constrained environments, communication overhead has to be carefully considered. To overcome the two limitations, this paper proposes a novel differentially private agent advising approach. Our approach employs the Laplace mechanism to add noise on the rewards used by student agents to select teacher agents. By using the differential privacy technique, the proposed approach can reduce the impact of malicious agents without identifying them. Also, by adopting the privacy budget concept, the proposed approach can naturally control communication overhead.

These attacks often employ multiple attack vectors for gaining initial access to the systems. Analysts are often challenged to identify malware objective, initial attack vectors, attack propagation, evading techniques, protective mechanisms and unseen techniques. Most of these attacks are frequently referred to as Multi stage attacks and pose a grave threat to organizations, individuals and the government. Early multistage attack detection is a crucial measure to counter malware and deactivate it. Most traditional security solutions use signature-based detection, which frequently fails to thwart zero-day attacks. Manual analysis of these samples requires enormous effort for effectively counter exponential growth of malware samples. In this paper, we present a novel approach leveraging Machine Learning and MITRE Adversary Tactic Technique and Common knowledge (ATT&CK) framework for early multistage attack detection in real time. Firstly, we have developed a run-time engine that receives notification while malicious executable is downloaded via browser or a launch of a new process in the system. Upon notification, the engine extracts the features from static executable for learning if the executable is malicious. Secondly, we use the MITRE ATT&CK framework, evolved based on the real-world observations of the cyber attacks, that best describes the multistage attack with respect to the adversary Tactics, Techniques and Procedure (TTP) for detecting the malicious executable as well as predict the stages that the malware executes during the attack. Lastly, we propose a real-time system that combines both these techniques for early multistage attack detection. The proposed model has been tested on 6000 unpacked malware samples and it achieves 98 % accuracy. The other major contribution in this paper is identifying the Windows API calls for each of the adversary techniques based on the MITRE ATT&CK.","2575-7288","978-1-6654-0521-8","10.1109/ICACCS51430.2021.9441956","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9441956","Windows API;machine learning;malware detection;static analysis;API calls;Portable Executable (PE);Malicious code;Tactics Techniques Procedure (TTP);Multistage attack;MITRE;Static Analysis","Machine learning;Manuals;Feature extraction;Real-time systems;Malware;Browsers;Security","application program interfaces;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);Microsoft Windows (operating systems)","multiple attack vectors;initial attack vectors;attack propagation;multistage attacks;zero-day attacks;cyber attacks;time early multistage attack detection;MITRe adversary tactic technique and common knowledge;ATT&CK;tactics techniques and procedure;TTP;Windows API calls","","","","22","","3 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These systems typically have limited performance, memory, and energy reserves, which limits their ability to run existing advanced malware protection, and that, in turn, makes securing them very challenging. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes, REMOTE, a new robust framework to detect malware by externally observing Electromagnetic (EM) signals emitted by an electronic computing device (e.g., a microprocessor) while running a known application, in real-time and with a low detection latency, and without any a priori knowledge of the malware. REMOTE does not require any resources or infrastructure on, or any modifications to, the monitored system itself, which makes REMOTE especially suitable for malware detection on resource-constrained devices such as embedded devices, CPSs, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices where hardware and energy resources may be limited. To demonstrate the usability of REMOTE in real-world scenarios, we port two real-world programs (an embedded medical device and an industrial PID controller), each with a meaningful attack (a code-reuse and a code-injection attack), to four different hardware platforms. We also port shellcode-based DDoS and Ransomware attacks to five different standard applications on an embedded system.

One solution is to use test input prioritization techniques that aim to identify and label only the most effective test instances. These prioritized test inputs can then be used with some popular testing techniques e.g., Metamorphic testing (MT) to test and uncover implementation bugs in computationally complex machine learning classifiers that suffer from the oracle problem. However, there are certain limitations involved with this approach, (i) using a small number of prioritized test inputs may not be enough to check the program correctness over a large variety of input scenarios, and (ii) traditional MT approaches become infeasible when the programs under test exhibit a non-deterministic behavior during training e.g., Neural Network-based classifiers. Therefore, instead of using MT for testing purposes, we propose a metamorphic relation to solve a data generation/labeling problem; that is, enhancing the test inputs effectiveness by extending the prioritized test set with new tests without incurring additional labeling costs. Further, we leverage the prioritized test inputs (both source and follow-up data sets) and propose a statistical hypothesis testing (for detection) and machine learning-based approach (for prediction) of faulty behavior in two other machine learning classifiers (Neural Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems). In our case, the problem is interesting in the sense that injected bugs represent the high accuracy producing mutated program versions that may be difficult to detect by a software developer. The results indicate that (i) the proposed statistical hypothesis testing is able to identify the induced buggy behavior, and (ii) Random Forest outperforms and achieves the best performance over SVM and k-NN algorithms.","","978-1-6654-3545-1","10.1109/SmartNets50376.2021.9555416","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9555416","Machine learning;Machine learning testing;Statistical hypothesis testing;Neural networks;Prioritized inputs;Metamorphic testing;Intrusion detection systems","Training;Support vector machines;Costs;Neural networks;Computer bugs;Software algorithms;Intrusion detection","","","","","","19","","5 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Extending pattern classification theory and design methods to adversarial settings is thus a novel and very relevant research direction, which has not yet been pursued in a systematic way. In this paper, we address one of the main open issues: evaluating at design phase the security of pattern classifiers, namely, the performance degradation under potential attacks they may incur during operation. We propose a framework for empirical evaluation of classifier security that formalizes and generalizes the main ideas proposed in the literature, and give examples of its use in three real applications.

Traditional malware detection methodology depends on either static or dynamic in-lab analysis to identify a suspicious file as malicious. When a file is identified as malware, the analyst extracts a structural signature, which is dispatched to subscriber machines. The signature should enable fast scanning, and should also be flexible enough to detect simple variants. In this paper we discuss 'naïve' variants which can be produced by a modestly skilled individual with publically accessible tools and knowhow which, if needed, can be found on the Internet. Furthermore, those variants can be derived directly from the malicious binary file, allowing anyone who has access to the binary file to modify it at his or her will. Modification can be automated, to produce large amounts of variants in short time. We describe several naïve modifications. We also put them to test against multiple antivirus products, resulting in significant decline of the average detection rate, compared to the original (unmodified) detection rate. Since the aforementioned decline may be related, at least in some cases, to avoidance of probable false positives, we also discuss the acceptable rate of false positives in the context of malware detection.","","978-1-4799-6364-5","10.1109/JISIC.2014.31","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6975567","malware detection;malware analysis;malware variants;crafty malware;false positive","Joints;Security;Informatics;Conferences","invasive software","anti-malware program resilience;nave variants;Internet;malicious binary file;antivirus products;average detection rate","","","","21","","6 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these augmentations and automation introduce security threats to network systems of smart airports.

Increasingly, the results of machine learning drive critical decisions in applications related to healthcare and biomedicine. Such health-related applications are often sensitive, and thus, any security breach would be catastrophic. Naturally, the integrity of the results computed by machine learning is of great importance. Recent research has shown that some machine-learning algorithms can be compromised by augmenting their training datasets with malicious data, leading to a new class of attacks called poisoning attacks. Hindrance of a diagnosis may have life-threatening consequences and could cause distrust. On the other hand, not only may a false diagnosis prompt users to distrust the machine-learning algorithm and even abandon the entire system but also such a false positive classification may cause patient distress. In this paper, we present a systematic, algorithm-independent approach for mounting poisoning attacks across a wide range of machine-learning algorithms and healthcare datasets. The proposed attack procedure generates input data, which, when added to the training set, can either cause the results of machine learning to have targeted errors (e.g., increase the likelihood of classification into a specific class), or simply introduce arbitrary errors (incorrect classification). These attacks may be applied to both fixed and evolving datasets. They can be applied even when only statistics of the training dataset are available or, in some cases, even without access to the training dataset, although at a lower efficacy. We establish the effectiveness of the proposed attacks using a suite of six machine-learning algorithms and five healthcare datasets. Finally, we present countermeasures against the proposed generic attacks that are based on tracking and detecting deviations in various accuracy metrics, and benchmark their effectiveness.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2014.2344095","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1219570); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6868201","Healthcare;machine learning;poisoning attacks;security","Machine learning algorithms;Training;Malware;Security","health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;pattern classification;security of data","systematic poisoning attacks;healthcare;application domains;critical decisions;biomedicine;health-related applications;security breach;machine-learning algorithms;training datasets;malicious data;life-threatening consequences;false diagnosis prompt users;false positive classification;patient distress;targeted errors;arbitrary errors","Algorithms;Computer Security;Databases, Factual;Humans;Machine Learning;Medical Informatics;Models, Theoretical;Neoplasms","60","1","47","IEEE","30 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fuzz testing is a widely used method for performing security checks that takes advantage of automation. However, there is a big challenge to carry out security checks on industrial network due to the increasing variety and complexity of industrial communication protocols. In this case, existing approaches usually take a long time to model the protocol for generating test cases, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. This becomes even worse when the target protocol is stateful. To help in addressing this problem, we employed a deep learning model to learn the structures of protocol frames and deal with the temporal features of stateful protocols. We propose a fuzzing framework named SeqFuzzer which automatically learns the protocol frame structures from communication traffic and generates fake but plausible messages as test cases.

Once adversaries have established a foothold within the target network, using seemingly-limited passive reconnaissance techniques, they can develop significant network reconnaissance capabilities. Cyber deception has been recognized as a critical capability to defend against such adversaries, but, without an accurate model of the adversary's reconnaissance behavior, current approaches are ineffective against advanced adversaries. To address this gap, we propose a novel model to capture how advanced, stealthy adversaries acquire knowledge about the target network and establish and expand their foothold within the system. This model quantifies the cost and reward, from the adversary's perspective, of compromising and maintaining control over target nodes. We evaluate our model through simulations in the CyberVAN testbed, and indicate how it can guide the development and deployment of future defensive capabilities, including high-interaction honeypots, so as to influence the behavior of adversaries and steer them away from critical resources.","","978-1-7281-4760-4","10.1109/CNS48642.2020.9162298","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9162298","","Reconnaissance;Tools;Computer worms;Organizations;Electronic mail;Knowledge engineering","computer crime;computer network security;military computing","network reconnaissance capabilities;defensive capabilities;advanced adversaries;quantitative framework;model reconnaissance;stealthy attackers;deception-based defenses;persistent cyber adversaries;foothold;passive reconnaissance techniques;cyber deception;critical capability","","","","20","","7 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, anomaly detection in ICS suffers from numerous false alarms. When false alarms occur, multiple sensors need to be checked, which is impractical. In this study, when an anomaly is detected, sensors displaying abnormal behavior are visually presented through XAI-based analysis to support quick practical actions and operations. Anomaly Detection has designed and applied better anomaly detection technology than the first prize at HAICon2020, an ICS security threat detection AI contest hosted by the National Security Research Institute last year, and explains the anomalies detected in its model.

This area of research has recently made great advances thanks to deep learning. A recent method, the deep Support Vector Data Description (deep SVDD), which is inspired by the classic kernel-based Support Vector Data Description (SVDD), is capable of simultaneously learning a feature representation of the data and a data-enclosing hypersphere. The method has shown promising results in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. However, deep SVDD suffers from hypersphere collapse-also known as mode collapse-, if the architecture of the model does not comply with certain architectural constraints, e.g. the removal of bias terms. These constraints limit the adaptability of the model and in some cases, may affect the model performance due to learning suboptimal features. In this work, we consider two regularizers to prevent hypersphere collapse in deep SVDD. The first regularizer is based on injecting random noise via the standard cross-entropy loss. The second regularizer penalizes the minibatch variance when it becomes too small. Moreover, we introduce an adaptive weighting scheme to control the amount of penalization between the SVDD loss and the respective regularizer. Our proposed regularized variants of deep SVDD show encouraging results and outperform a prominent state-of-the-art method on a setup where the anomalies have no apparent geometrical structure.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-6926-2","10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9207209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9207209","deep SVDD;mode collapse;anomaly detection","Gallium nitride;Anomaly detection;Training;Standards;Adaptation models;Image reconstruction;Generators","entropy;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;random noise;support vector machines","anomaly detection;deep learning;deep support vector data description;data-enclosing hypersphere;regularizer;SVDD loss;hypersphere collapse;classic kernel-based support vector data description;deep SVDD","","1","","41","","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Alcatraz leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) created by Intel SGX to protect modules providing these security properties. To achieve exfiltration resilience, our architecture ensures that sensitive information is only processed within a TEE, from the sender to the receiver and along all network nodes. Although our architecture requires many changes, it explores the design space of what level of security can be achieved today with commodity hardware.

This situation calls for the design of new techniques that can be incorporated into security protocols to meet these challenges successfully. An important tool for developing new security protocols as well as estimating their effectiveness is game theory. This game theory framework usually involves two players or agents: 1) a protector and 2) an adversary, and two patterns of agent behavior are considered: 1) selfish behavior, where each of the agents wants to maximize his payoff; and 2) leader and follower behavior, where one agent (the leader) expects that the other agent (the follower) will respond to the leader's strategy. Such an approach assumes that the agents agree on which strategy to apply in advance. In this paper, this strong assumption is relaxed. Namely, the following question is considered: what happens if it is unknown a priori what pattern of behavior the adversary is going to use, or in other words, it is not known, what game he intends to play? Using a simple game-theoretic model, it is shown that the protector can lose if he does not take into account the possibility that the adversary can play a game other than the one the protector has in mind. Further considered is a repeated game in which the protector can learn about the presence of an adversary, and the behavior of belief probabilities is analyzed in this setting.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2015.2475243","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CMMI-1436288,CMMI-1435778); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7274702","Bayesian equilibrium;Bayesian learning;Nash equilibrium;network protection;Stackelberg equilibrium","Games;Security;Game theory;Bayes methods;Jamming;Cybernetics;Protocols","cryptographic protocols;game theory;probability","security games;unknown adversarial strategies;security community;security threats;security protocols;game theory framework;game-theoretic model;probability","","34","","43","IEEE","23 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As such, this serves as an important complement to the existing server-based anti-phishing mechanisms which predominately use blacklists. Blacklisting suffers from several inherent drawbacks in terms of correctness, timeliness, and completeness. Due to the potentially significant lag prior to site blacklisting, there is a window of opportunity for attackers. Other local client-side phishing detection approaches also exist, but primarily rely on page content or URLs, which are arguably easier to manipulate by attackers. We illustrate that our certificate-based approach greatly increases the difficulty of masquerading undetected for phishers, with single millisecond delays for users. We further show that this approach works not only against HTTPS-enabled phishing attacks, but also detects HTTP phishing attacks with port 443 enabled.","2159-1245","978-1-4799-8909-6","10.1109/ECRIME.2015.7120795","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7120795","certificates;machine learning;security","Feature extraction;Electronic mail;Browsers;Public key;Uniform resource locators;Servers","computer crime;learning (artificial intelligence);public key cryptography;Web sites","Web site phishing detection;public key certificate;machine-learning approach from;HTTPS-enabled phishing attack;server-based antiphishing mechanism;site blacklisting","","20","","38","","11 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Bereft of security features, in-vehicle CANs are exposed to cyber manipulation and multiple researches have proved viable, life-threatening cyber attacks. Complicating the issue, CAN messages lack a common mapping of functions to commands, so packets are observable but not easily decipherable. We present a transformational approach to CAN IDS that exploits the geometric properties of CAN data to inform two novel detectors - one based on distance from a learned, lower dimensional manifold and the other on discontinuities of the manifold over time. Proof-of-concept tests are presented by implementing a potential attack approach on a driving vehicle. The initial results suggest that (1) the first detector requires additional refinement but does hold promise; (2) the second detector gives a clear, strong indicator of the attack; and (3) the algorithms keep pace with high-speed CAN messages. As our approach is data-driven it provides a vehicle-agnostic IDS that eliminates the need to reverse engineer CAN messages and can be ported to an after-market plugin.","2577-2465","978-1-5386-6358-5","10.1109/VTCFall.2018.8690644","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8690644","","Manifolds;Correlation;Detectors;Shape;Computer hacking;Government","automotive electronics;computer network security;controller area networks;reverse engineering","CAN data;In-Vehicle Intrusion Detection;electronic control units;ECUs;controller area networks;security features;in-vehicle CANs;life-threatening cyber attacks;CAN messages;transformational approach;CAN IDS;geometric properties;learned manifold;lower dimensional manifold;proof-of-concept tests;vehicle-agnostic IDS;data-driven approach","","7","","29","","14 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As deep learning has succeeded in various domains, it has been adopted for network anomaly detection using a supervised learning approach. Due to the high velocity and dynamics of network traffic, labeling such voluminous network data with specific domain knowledge is difficult, and yet impossible. It makes supervised learning techniques become impractical. Several existing works have proposed unsupervised learning techniques to train detection models with unlabeled data. However, a single model cannot detect all types of attacking traffic due to the variety of their behavior. In this work, we develop an ensemble framework that uses different AutoEncoders (AEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) for network anomaly detection. We develop a weighting scheme that allows us to quantify the importance (goodness) of each model to each attacking traffic and then determine the final prediction score during the inference (detection) phase. We carry out extensive experiments on two recent datasets including UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS2017 to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The experimental results have shown that our framework significantly outperforms many state-of-the-art methods with an increase of up to 14.70% in various performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-measure, AUROC and AUPRC.","","978-1-6654-0285-9","10.1109/CSR51186.2021.9527982","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9527982","Ensemble Method;Unsupervised Deep Learning;Network Anomaly Detection;Network Security","Measurement;Training;Supervised learning;Telecommunication traffic;Predictive models;Data models;Security","","","","","","26","","6 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our study reveals the existence of the dedicated web proxy DOM among hosts that play orchestrating roles in proxy activities. Motivated by their distinctive features in DOM and URL, we developed an automatical stepping-stone detection system-ProxyDetector.

The fundamental challenge is the security of the communication link where an attacker can inject messages (e.g., increase the speed) that may impact the safety of the driver. Most of existing practical IDS solutions rely on the knowledge of the identity of the ECUs, which is proprietary information. This paper proposes a message injection attack detection solution that is independent of the IDs of the ECUs. First, we represent the sequencing of the messages in a given time-interval as a direct graph and compute the similarities of the successive graphs using the cosine similarity and Pearson correlation. Then, we apply threshold, change point detection, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to detect and predict malicious message injections into the CAN bus. The evaluation of the methods using a dataset collected from a moving vehicle under malicious RPM and speed reading message injections show a detection accuracy of 97.32% and detection speed of 2.5 milliseconds when using a threshold method. The performance metrics makes the IDS suitable for real-time control mechanisms for vehicle resiliency to cyber-attacks.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2021.3098162","Iowa State University’s Regents Innovation Fund (RIF); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9490207","Industry applications;security;information security;intrusion detection;intelligent transportation systems;transportation;vehicle;mathematics;algorithms;detection algorithms","Security;Automobiles;Connected vehicles;Protocols;Safety;Universal Serial Bus;Time-frequency analysis","automobiles;automotive electronics;computer network security;control engineering computing;controller area networks;recurrent neural nets","message injection attacks;CAN bus;successive messages-sequence graphs;smart features;modern cars;ECU;in-vehicle network;controller area network bus;communication link;practical IDS solutions;message injection attack detection solution;time-interval;direct graph;successive graphs;cosine similarity;change point detection;long short-term memory-recurrent neural network;malicious message injections;detection accuracy;IDS suitable;real-time control mechanisms;cyber-attacks;electronic control units components;LSTM;RNN","","","","63","IEEE","19 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There have been various attempts to manage COVID-19 and other pandemics using technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G/6G communications. However, we also need to ensure that IoT devices used to facilitate COVID-19 monitoring and treatment (e.g., medical IoT devices) are secured, as the compromise of such devices can have significant consequences (e.g., life-threatening risks to COVID-19 patients). Hence, in this paper we comprehensively survey existing IoT-related solutions, potential security and privacy risks and their requirements. For example, we classify existing security and privacy solutions into five categories, namely: authentication and access control solutions, key management and cryptography solutions, blockchain-based solutions, intrusion detection systems, and privacy-preserving solutions.

A HTTP Bots stealthily infect mobile devices and periodically communicate with their controller called Botmaster. Although the Bots hide their activities amongst the normal web flows, their periodic pattern has been used as a measure to detect their activities.

To mitigate sensor, actuator attacks, and performance loss due to such attacks, we formulate a secure control algorithm that consists of a proactive and a reactive defense mechanism. The proactive mechanism, which is based on the principles of moving target defense, utilizes a stochastic switching structure to dynamically and continuously alter the parameters of the system, while hindering the attacker's ability to conduct successful reconnaissance to the system. The unpredictability of the current actuator and sensor is optimized using an information entropy measure, which is induced by probabilistic switching. The reactive mechanism on the other side, detects potentially attacked components, namely sensors and actuators, by leveraging online data to compute an integral Bellman error. A rigorous mathematical framework is presented to guarantee the stability of the equilibrium point of the closed-loop system, and provide a quantified bound on the performance loss when utilizing both reactive and proactive mechanisms.

A security breach's impact is not limited to cyberspace, as it can also affect or be facilitated in physical space, for example, via voice. In this environment, intrusion detection cannot rely solely on static models that remain the same over time and are the same for all users. We present MAGPIE, the first smart home intrusion detection system that is able to autonomously adjust the decision function of its underlying anomaly classification models to a smart home's changing conditions (e.g., new devices, new automation rules and user interaction with them). The method achieves this goal by applying a novel probabilistic cluster-based reward mechanism to non-stationary multi-armed bandit reinforcement learning. MAGPIE rewards the sets of hyperparameters of its underlying isolation forest unsupervised anomaly classifiers based on the cluster silhouette scores of their output. Experimental evaluation in a real household shows that MAGPIE exhibits high accuracy because of two further innovations: it takes into account both cyber and physical sources of data; and it detects human presence to utilise models that exhibit the highest accuracy in each case. MAGPIE is available in open-source format, together with its evaluation datasets, so it can benefit from future advances in unsupervised and reinforcement learning and be able to be enriched with further sources of data as smart home environments and attacks evolve.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2020.3042049","European Coordinated Research on Long-term Challenges in Information and Communication Sciences and Technologies ERA-NET (CHIST-ERA), under Project COCOON; EPSRC(grant numbers:EP/P016448/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9277640","Intrusion detection system;cyber-physical attacks;smart home;reinforcement learning","Smart homes;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Hidden Markov models;Reinforcement learning;Wireless fidelity;Monitoring","home automation;home computing;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;probability;security of data","smart home environments;self-configurable cyber-physical intrusion detection;users interact;security breach;static models;MAGPIE;smart home intrusion detection system;decision function;user interaction;nonstationary multiarmed bandit reinforcement learning;isolation forest;anomaly classifiers;cluster silhouette scores;probabilistic cluster-based reward mechanism;anomaly classification models;cyber risk attitudes;Internet of Things-based smart home","","","","45","IEEE","2 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose LIFH, a deep neural network model equipped with interactive information for detecting application-layer attacks. Firstly, the image reconstruction method is designed to reconstruct the HTTP traffic session into an image. Then, the latent features, instead of explicit features which are typically used in machine learning models, are extracted by HTTP-CNN in order to respond against forgery attacks. Finally, the high-level features are further fed to multi-classifiers to identify the traffic involved in malicious activities. We make exclusive experiments and evaluate the performance of LIFH on the standard dataset CICIDS_2017 and IIE_data collected from critical web servers.
